Subject: [PATCH] kabi fix for NFSv4: Prevent NULL-pointer dereference in
 nfs42_complete_copies()
Patch-mainline: never, kABI fix
References: bsc#1231902 CVE-2024-50046

Move the newly introduced member to the end of struct nfs_server, and
hide it from the kABI checker. This should be safe since the struct is
allocated and initialized by nfs_alloc_server().

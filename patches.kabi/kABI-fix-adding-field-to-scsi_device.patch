Subject: [PATCH] kABI: fix adding field to scsi_device
Patch-mainline: Never, kABI fix
References: git-fixes

Patch scsi-libiscsi-Teardown-iscsi_cls_conn-gracefully.patch removed
iscsi_destroy_conn() since it was no longer needed, but this patch
puts it back, in case any external module expects it to be present,
for kABI compatability.

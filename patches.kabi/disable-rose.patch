Subject: drop rose drivers
Patch-mainline: never, kabi fixup
References: bsc#1238471

In order to disable AX25 we need to disable also ROSE drivers family
because they rely on symbols exported by AX25. Disabling CONFIG_ROSE
is not possible for similar reasons as AX25 because that would alter other
core drivers structures hence use the same approach as in patches.kabi/disable-ax25.patch.

These drivers are not supported so we do not distribute them anymore

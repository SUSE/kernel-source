# This script is used by the commit hook to detect if there are changes in the
# sorted section. Developers may commit to kernel-source without having changed
# the sorted section and used the git-sort tools, therefore without having the
# pygit2 module available. Therefore, this script should avoid a dependency on
# pygit2 since it's not present on a default python install and we don't want to
# force developers to install pygit2 just to commit unrelated changes to
# kernel-source.

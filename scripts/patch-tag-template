# Here all the valid metadata tags for suse patches are recorded.  Patches
# in the SUSE kernel repository must have a Subject tag, and there must
# be a suse email address in a From:, Signed-off-by: or Acked-by: tag.
#
# Every patch in the SUSE repository must have a descriptive comment in
# addition to any tags present
#
# The original patch author
#
From: 

# a brief one line description of the patch
#
Subject: 

# Signed off by means that you have reviewed the patch for correctness
# Multiple signed-off-by tags are allowed
#
Signed-off-by: 

# Acked-by is not as strong as signed-off-by.  This would be used when
# the patch has already been signed off by someone you trust.
# Multiple acked-by tags are allowed
#
Acked-by: 

# Patch-mainline indicates which version of Linus' kernel includes the patch.
# Patch-mainline has a few special values for the first word of the tag.  
# These are used by scripts to check on the status of patches in the 
# repository, reminding us to send them into mainline.
#
# "never" indicates the patch will never be sent to mainline.  A short 
# explanation should follow
#
# "submitted yyyy-mm-dd" gives the date the patch was sent for inclusion.
#
# examples:
# Patch-mainline: never.  fixes bugs in SUSE specific code
# Patch-mainline: submitted 2004-11-01
# Patch-mainline: v2.6.10-rc1 any free form text is valid after the version
#
Patch-mainline: 

# bug numbers corresponding to this patch.  Any bugzilla database other
# then SUSE needs to have ids qualified by some string (ie LTC11210)
# Multiple bug numbers should be put into a single tag:
# References: 32768 LTC1002 OSDL3080

References: 

# A patch can be merged through multiple branches and thus have more than one
# hash. Use the Alt-commit tag followed by a hash to prevent git-fixes to report
# multiple occurrences of the same patch. Additionally git-fixes can also find
# potential fixes for the Alt-commit hash.
# Only one hash is allowed per Alt-commit tag.

Subject: selftests/bpf: Make netcnt selftests serial to avoid spurious
 failures
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
Git-commit: 401a33da3a45cc05859b121314f8ab52c2c01977
References: jsc#PED-1368

When running `./test_progs -j` test_netcnt fails with a very high
probability, undercounting number of packets received (9999 vs expected
10000). It seems to be conflicting with other cgroup/skb selftests. So
make it serial for now to make parallel mode more robust.

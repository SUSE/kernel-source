Subject: swiotlb: don't panic!
Git-commit: 639205ed206f98fcfa826933946f0844615784ea
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

The panics in swiotlb are relics of a bygone era, some of them
inadvertently inherited from a memblock refactor, and all of them
unnecessary since they are in places that may also fail gracefully
anyway.

Convert the panics in swiotlb_init_remap() into non-fatal warnings
more consistent with the other bail-out paths there and in
swiotlb_init_late() (but don't bother trying to roll anything back,
since if anything does actually fail that early, the aim is merely to
keep going as far as possible to get more diagnostic information out
of the inevitably-dying kernel). It's not for SWIOTLB to decide that the
system is terminally compromised just because there *might* turn out to
be one or more 32-bit devices that might want to make streaming DMA
mappings, especially since we already handle the no-buffer case later
if it turns out someone did want it.

Similarly though, downgrade that panic in swiotlb_tbl_map_single(),
since even if we do get to that point it's an overly extreme reaction.
It makes little difference to the DMA API caller whether a mapping fails
because the buffer is full or because there is no buffer, and once again
it's not for SWIOTLB to presume that any particular DMA mapping is so
fundamental to the operation of the system that it must be terminal if
it could never succeed. Even if the caller handles failure by futilely
retrying forever, a single stuck thread is considerably less impactful
to the user than a needless panic.

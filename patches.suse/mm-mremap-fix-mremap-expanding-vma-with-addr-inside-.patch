Subject: mm, mremap: fix mremap() expanding vma with addr inside vma
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 6f12be792fde994ed934168f93c2a0d2a0cf0bc5
Patch-mainline: 6.2-rc1
References: bsc#1206359

Since 6.1 we have noticed random rpm install failures that were tracked to
mremap() returning -ENOMEM and to commit ca3d76b0aa80 ("mm: add merging
after mremap resize").

The problem occurs when mremap() expands a VMA in place, but using an
starting address that's not vma->vm_start, but somewhere in the middle.
The extension_pgoff calculation introduced by the commit is wrong in that
case, so vma_merge() fails due to pgoffs not being compatible.  Fix the
calculation.

By the way it seems that the situations, where rpm now expands a vma from
the middle, were made possible also due to that commit, thanks to the
improved vma merging.  Yet it should work just fine, except for the buggy
calculation.

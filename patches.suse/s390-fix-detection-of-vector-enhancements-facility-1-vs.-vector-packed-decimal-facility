Subject: s390: fix detection of vector enhancements facility 1 vs. vector
 packed decimal facility
Git-commit: b208108638c4bd3215792415944467c36f5dfd97
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

The PoP documents:
	134: The vector packed decimal facility is installed in the
	     z/Architecture architectural mode. When bit 134 is
	     one, bit 129 is also one.
	135: The vector enhancements facility 1 is installed in
	     the z/Architecture architectural mode. When bit 135
	     is one, bit 129 is also one.

Looks like we confuse the vector enhancements facility 1 ("EXT") with the
Vector packed decimal facility ("BCD"). Let's fix the facility checks.

Detected while working on QEMU/tcg z14 support and only unlocking
the vector enhancements facility 1, but not the vector packed decimal
facility.

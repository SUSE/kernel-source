Subject: drm/i915/dp: Update Comment for Valid DSC Slices per Line
Git-commit: e1faaca9d408d184d37204a9c94235d7030ccb15
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

For some platforms, the maximum slices per DSC engine is 4, while for
others it is 2. Update the comment to reflect this and clarify that
the 'valid_dsc_slicecount' list represents the valid number of slices
per pipe.

Currently, we are working with 1, and 2 slices per DSC engine,
which works for all platforms. With this the number of slices per pipe
can be 1,2 or 4 with different slice & DSC engine configuration.

Add a #TODO for adding support for 4 slices per DSC engine where
supported.

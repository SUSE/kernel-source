Subject: [PATCH] ext4: correct the start block of counting reserved clusters
Git-commit: 40ea98396a3659062267d1fe5f99af4f7e4f05e3
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1234169

When big allocate feature is enabled, we need to count and update
reserved clusters before removing a delayed only extent_status entry.
{init|count|get}_rsvd() have already done this, but the start block
number of this counting isn't correct in the following case.

  lblk            end
   |               |
   v               v
          -------------------------
          |                       | orig_es
          -------------------------
                   ^              ^
      len1 is 0    |     len2     |

If the start block of the orig_es entry founded is bigger than lblk, we
passed lblk as start block to count_rsvd(), but the length is correct,
finally, the range to be counted is offset. This patch fix this by
passing the start blocks to 'orig_es->lblk + len1'.

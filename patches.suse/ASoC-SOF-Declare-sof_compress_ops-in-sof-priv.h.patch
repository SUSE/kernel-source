Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: Declare sof_compress_ops in sof-priv.h
Git-commit: 299905881ebd3b7ee5e3525356529c3d0ceb0688
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-850

Fix the following sparse error:
sound/soc/sof/compress.c:310:25: error: symbol 'sof_compressed_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?

Do not enable set the pd->compress_ops yet as it is not a valid assumption
that real compress support really works when CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_COMPRESS
is set as the HDA Probes support also selects it, but compressed audio
is not supported (yet) on Intel platforms.

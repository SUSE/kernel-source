Subject: [PATCH] clk: Fix clk_hw_get_clk() when dev is NULL
Git-commit: 0c1b56df451716ba207bbf59f303473643eee4fd
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Any registered clk_core structure can have a NULL pointer in its dev
field. While never actually documented, this is evidenced by the wide
usage of clk_register and clk_hw_register with a NULL device pointer,
and the fact that the core of_clk_hw_register() function also passes a
NULL device pointer.

A call to clk_hw_get_clk() on a clk_hw struct whose clk_core is in that
case will result in a NULL pointer derefence when it calls dev_name() on
that NULL device pointer.

Add a test for this case and use NULL as the dev_id if the device
pointer is NULL.

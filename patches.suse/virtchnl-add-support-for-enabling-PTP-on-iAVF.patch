Subject: virtchnl: add support for enabling PTP on iAVF
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
Git-commit: 27ebd8bf9e4b53388cef2d9cdb2947bc456b0b33
References: jsc#PED-15072

Add support for allowing a VF to enable PTP feature - Rx timestamps

The new capability is gated by VIRTCHNL_VF_CAP_PTP, which must be
set by the VF to request access to the new operations. In addition, the
VIRTCHNL_OP_1588_PTP_CAPS command is used to determine the specific
capabilities available to the VF.

This support includes the following additional capabilities:

* Rx timestamps enabled in the Rx queues (when using flexible advanced
  descriptors)
* Read access to PHC time over virtchnl using
  VIRTCHNL_OP_1588_PTP_GET_TIME

Extra space is reserved in most structures to allow for future
extension (like set clock, Tx timestamps).  Additional opcode numbers
are reserved and space in the virtchnl_ptp_caps structure is
specifically set aside for this.
Additionally, each structure has some space reserved for future
extensions to allow some flexibility.

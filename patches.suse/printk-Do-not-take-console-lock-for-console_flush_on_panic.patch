Subject: printk: Do not take console lock for console_flush_on_panic()
Git-commit: eacb04ff3c5b8662a65f380ae450250698448cff
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: bsc#1225607

Currently console_flush_on_panic() will attempt to acquire the
console lock when flushing the buffer on panic. If it fails to
acquire the lock, it continues anyway because this is the last
chance to get any pending records printed.

The reason why the console lock was attempted at all was to
prevent any other CPUs from acquiring the console lock for
printing while the panic CPU was printing. But as of the
previous commit, non-panic CPUs will no longer attempt to
acquire the console lock in a panic situation. Therefore it is
no longer strictly necessary for a panic CPU to acquire the
console lock.

Avoiding taking the console lock when flushing in panic has
the additional benefit of avoiding possible deadlocks due to
semaphore usage in NMI context (semaphores are not NMI-safe)
and avoiding possible deadlocks if another CPU accesses the
semaphore and is stopped while holding one of the semaphore's
internal spinlocks.

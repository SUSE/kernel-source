Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1

When using sysbench to benchmark Postgres in a single docker instance
with sysbench's nr_threads set to nr_cpu, it is observed there are times
update_cfs_group() and update_load_avg() shows noticeable overhead on
a 2sockets/112core/224cpu Intel Sapphire Rapids(SPR):

    13.75%    13.74%  [kernel.vmlinux]           [k] update_cfs_group
    10.63%    10.04%  [kernel.vmlinux]           [k] update_load_avg

Annotate shows the cycles are mostly spent on accessing tg->load_avg
with update_load_avg() being the write side and update_cfs_group() being
the read side. tg->load_avg is per task group and when different tasks
of the same taskgroup running on different CPUs frequently access
tg->load_avg, it can be heavily contended.

E.g. when running postgres_sysbench on a 2sockets/112cores/224cpus Intel
Sappire Rapids, during a 5s window, the wakeup number is 14millions and
migration number is 11millions and with each migration, the task's load
will transfer from src cfs_rq to target cfs_rq and each change involves
an update to tg->load_avg. Since the workload can trigger as many wakeups
and migrations, the access(both read and write) to tg->load_avg can be
unbound. As a result, the two mentioned functions showed noticeable
overhead. With netperf/nr_client=nr_cpu/UDP_RR, the problem is worse:
during a 5s window, wakeup number is 21millions and migration number is
14millions; update_cfs_group() costs ~25% and update_load_avg() costs ~16%.

Reduce the overhead by limiting updates to tg->load_avg to at most once
per ms. The update frequency is a tradeoff between tracking accuracy and
overhead. 1ms is chosen because PELT window is roughly 1ms and it
delivered good results for the tests that I've done. After this change,
the cost of accessing tg->load_avg is greatly reduced and performance
improved. Detailed test results below.

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: remove experimental tag for dax support
Patch-mainline: Not yet, xfs dax not considered stable upstream
References: FATE#324503

We have been supporting xfs dax for a while, and we are continuing to do
so for all future releases. Remove the warning when the filesystem is
mounted with the dax option passed, in accordance with that.

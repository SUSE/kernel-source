Subject: [PATCH] drm/display/dp_mst: Fix down/up message handling after sink disconnect
Git-commit: 1d082618bbf3b6755b8cc68c0a8122af2842d593
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

If the sink gets disconnected during receiving a multi-packet DP MST AUX
down-reply/up-request sideband message, the state keeping track of which
packets have been received already is not reset. This results in a failed
sanity check for the subsequent message packet received after a sink is
reconnected (due to the pending message not yet completed with an
end-of-message-transfer packet), indicated by the

"sideband msg set header failed"

error.

Fix the above by resetting the up/down message reception state after a
disconnect event.

Subject: [PATCH] fgraph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]
Git-commit: d65474033740ded0a4fe9a097fce72328655b41d
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc6
References: CVE-2024-57934 bsc#1236179

In __ftrace_return_to_handler(), a loop iterates over the fgraph_array[]
elements, which are fgraph_ops. The loop checks if an element is a
fgraph_stub to prevent using a fgraph_stub afterward.

However, if the compiler reloads fgraph_array[] after this check, it might
race with an update to fgraph_array[] that introduces a fgraph_stub. This
could result in the stub being processed, but the stub contains a null
"func_hash" field, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

To ensure that the gops compared against the fgraph_stub matches the gops
processed later, add a READ_ONCE(). A similar patch appears in commit
63a8dfb ("function_graph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]").

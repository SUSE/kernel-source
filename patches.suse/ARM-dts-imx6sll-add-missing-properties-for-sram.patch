Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6sll: add missing properties for sram
Git-commit: 7492a83ed9b7a151e2dd11d64b06da7a7f0fa7f9

All 3 properties are required by sram.yaml. Fixes the dtbs_check warning:
Sram@900000: '#address-cells' is a required property
Sram@900000: '#size-cells' is a required property
Sram@900000: 'ranges' is a required property

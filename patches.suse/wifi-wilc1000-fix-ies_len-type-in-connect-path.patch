Commit 205c50306acf ("wifi: wilc1000: fix RCU usage in connect path")
made sure that the IEs data was manipulated under the relevant RCU section.
Unfortunately, while doing so, the commit brought a faulty implicit cast
from int to u8 on the ies_len variable, making the parsing fail to be
performed correctly if the IEs block is larger than 255 bytes. This failure
can be observed with Access Points appending a lot of IEs TLVs in their
beacon frames (reproduced with a Pixel phone acting as an Access Point,
which brough 273 bytes of IE data in my testing environment).

Fix IEs parsing by removing this undesired implicit cast.

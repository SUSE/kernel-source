Subject: mm/slub: avoid accessing metadata when pointer is invalid in
 object_err()
Git-commit: b4efccec8d06ceb10a7d34d7b1c449c569d53770
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc5
References: CVE-2025-39902 bsc#1250702

object_err() reports details of an object for further debugging, such as
the freelist pointer, redzone, etc. However, if the pointer is invalid,
attempting to access object metadata can lead to a crash since it does
not point to a valid object.

One known path to the crash is when alloc_consistency_checks()
determines the pointer to the allocated object is invalid because of a
freelist corruption, and calls object_err() to report it. The debug code
should report and handle the corruption gracefully and not crash in the
process.

In case the pointer is NULL or check_valid_pointer() returns false for
the pointer, only print the pointer value and skip accessing metadata.

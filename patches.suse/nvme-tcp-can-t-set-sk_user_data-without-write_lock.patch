Subject: nvme-tcp: can't set sk_user_data without write_lock
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
Git-commit: 0755d3be2d9bb6ea38598ccd30d6bbaa1a5c3a50
References: CVE-2021-47041 bsc#1220755

The sk_user_data pointer is supposed to be modified only while
holding the write_lock "sk_callback_lock", otherwise
we could race with other threads and crash the kernel.

we can't take the write_lock in nvmet_tcp_state_change()
because it would cause a deadlock, but the release_work queue
will set the pointer to NULL later so we can simply remove
the assignment.

Fixes: b5332a9f3f3d ("nvmet-tcp: fix incorrect locking in state_change sk callback")

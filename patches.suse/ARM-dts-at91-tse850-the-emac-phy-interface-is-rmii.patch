Subject: ARM: dts: at91: tse850: the emac<->phy interface is rmii
Git-commit: dcdbc335a91a26e022a803e1a6b837266989c032
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

This went unnoticed until commit 7897b071ac3b ("net: macb: convert
to phylink") which tickled the problem. The sama5d3 emac has never
been capable of rgmii, and it all just happened to work before that
commit.

Fixes: 21dd0ece34c2 ("ARM: dts: at91: add devicetree for the Axentia TSE-850")

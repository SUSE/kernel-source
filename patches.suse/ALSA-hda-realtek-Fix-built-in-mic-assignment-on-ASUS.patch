Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix built-in mic assignment on ASUS VivoBook X515UA
Git-commit: 829ee558f3527fd602c6e2e9f270959d1de09fe0
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

ASUS VivoBook X515UA with PCI SSID 1043:106f had a default quirk
pickup via pin table that applies ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC, but this adds
a bogus built-in mic pin 0x13 enabled.  This was no big problem
because the pin 0x13 was assigned as the secondary mic, but the recent
fix made the entries sorted, hence this bogus pin appeared now as the
primary input and it broke.

For fixing the bug, put the right quirk entry for this device pointing
to ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC_NO_PRESENCE.

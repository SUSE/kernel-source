Subject: drm/i915/bios: double check array-boundary in parse_sdvo_lvds_data
Git-commit: b2c2f2df6f01174eefc1ea2aa9aef8b1a6c69575
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

During static analysis, a concern was raised that we may access the
dtd->dtd[] array out of bounds, because we are not checking whether
the index we use is larger than the array.

This should not be a problem as is, because the enumeration that is
used for this index comes from "panel_type", which uses an enumeration
with 4 items.  But if this enumeration is ever changed, it can lead to
hard-to-detect bugs, so better double-check it before using it as an
index to the array.

Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Fix imbalance overflow

References: bsc#1155798 (CPU scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc7
Git-commit: 91dcf1e8068e9a8823e419a7a34ff4341275fb70

When local group is fully busy but its average load is above system load,
computing the imbalance will overflow and local group is not the best
target for pulling this load.

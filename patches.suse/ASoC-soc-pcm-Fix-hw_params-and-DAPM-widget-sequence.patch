Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: soc-pcm: Fix hw_params() and DAPM widget sequence
Git-commit: 9aff2e8df240e84a36f2607f98a0a9924a24e65d
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc5
References: git-fixes

Issue: When multiple audio streams share a common BE DAI, the BE DAI widget can be powered up before its hardware parameters are configured. This incorrect sequence leads to intermittent pcm_write errors.

 For example, the below Tegra use-case throws an error:
  aplay(2 streams) -> AMX(mux) -> ADX(demux) -> arecord(2 streams),
  here, 'AMX TX' and 'ADX RX' are common BE DAIs.

For above usecase when failure happens below sequence is observed:
 aplay(1) FE open()
  - BE DAI callbacks added to the list
  - BE DAI state = SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_OPEN
 aplay(2) FE open()
  - BE DAI callbacks are not added to the list as the state is
    already SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_OPEN during aplay(1) FE open().
 aplay(2) FE hw_params()
  - BE DAI hw_params() callback ignored
 aplay(2) FE prepare()
  - Widget is powered ON without BE DAI hw_params() call
 aplay(1) FE hw_params()
  - BE DAI hw_params() is now called

Fix: Add BE DAIs in the list if its state is either SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_OPEN or SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_HW_PARAMS as well.

It ensures the widget is powered ON after BE DAI hw_params() callback.

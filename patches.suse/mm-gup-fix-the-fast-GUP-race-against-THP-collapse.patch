Subject: mm: gup: fix the fast GUP race against THP collapse
Git-commit: 70cbc3cc78a997d8247b50389d37c4e1736019da
Patch-mainline: v6.0
References: CVE-2022-48991 bsc#1232070 prerequisity

Since general RCU GUP fast was introduced in commit 2667f50e8b81 ("mm:
introduce a general RCU get_user_pages_fast()"), a TLB flush is no longer
sufficient to handle concurrent GUP-fast in all cases, it only handles
traditional IPI-based GUP-fast correctly.  On architectures that send an
IPI broadcast on TLB flush, it works as expected.  But on the
architectures that do not use IPI to broadcast TLB flush, it may have the
below race:

   CPU A                                          CPU B
THP collapse                                     fast GUP
                                              gup_pmd_range() <-- see valid pmd
                                                  gup_pte_range() <-- work on pte
pmdp_collapse_flush() <-- clear pmd and flush
__collapse_huge_page_isolate()
    check page pinned <-- before GUP bump refcount
                                                      pin the page
                                                      check PTE <-- no change
__collapse_huge_page_copy()
    copy data to huge page
    ptep_clear()
install huge pmd for the huge page
                                                      return the stale page
discard the stale page

The race can be fixed by checking whether PMD is changed or not after
taking the page pin in fast GUP, just like what it does for PTE.  If the
PMD is changed it means there may be parallel THP collapse, so GUP should
back off.

Also update the stale comment about serializing against fast GUP in
khugepaged.

This appears to be a race between the unmount process, which frees the
CIL and waits for in-flight iclog IO; and the iclog IO completion.  When
generic/475 runs, it starts fsstress in the background, waits a few
seconds, and substitutes a dm-error device to simulate a disk falling
out of a machine.  If the fsstress encounters EIO on a pure data write,
it will exit but the filesystem will still be online.

The next thing the test does is unmount the filesystem, which tries to
clean the log, free the CIL, and wait for iclog IO completion.  If an
iclog was being written when the dm-error switch occurred, it can race
with log unmounting as follows:

Thread 1				Thread 2

					xfs_log_unmount
					xfs_log_clean
					xfs_log_quiesce
xlog_ioend_work
<observe error>
xlog_force_shutdown
test_and_set_bit(XLOG_IOERROR)
					xfs_log_force
					<log is shut down, nop>
					xfs_log_umount_write
					<log is shut down, nop>
					xlog_dealloc_log
					xlog_cil_destroy
					<wait for iclogs>
spin_lock(&log->l_cilp->xc_push_lock)
<KABOOM>

Therefore, free the CIL after waiting for the iclogs to complete.  I
/think/ this race has existed for quite a few years now, though I don't
remember the ~2014 era logging code well enough to know if it was a real
threat then or if the actual race was exposed only more recently.

Subject: ARM: dts: sun8i: r40: Move AHCI device node based on address order
Git-commit: fe3a04824f75786e39ed74e82fb6cb2534c95fe4
Patch-mainline: v5.6
References: git-fixes

When the AHCI device node was added, it was added in the wrong location
in the device tree file. The device nodes should be sorted by register
address.

Move the device node to before EHCI1, where it belongs.

Fixes: 41c64d3318aa ("ARM: dts: sun8i: r40: add sata node")

Subject: perf vendor events intel: Update cascadelakex to 1.19
Git-commit: 0c9e39421cd00258f7cd17b25ee5fe177a3088dd
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: perf-v6.7 (jsc#PED-6012 jsc#PED-6121)

Updates were released in:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/e4f83534f23a69e6da55c672c4d929919688c9b6
Adds the events IDQ.DSB_CYCLES_OK, IDQ.DSB_CYCLES_ANY,
ICACHE_TAG.STALLS, DECODE.LCP, LSD.CYCLES_OK. Descriptions are also
updated.

Subject: genirq/cpuhotplug: Skip suspended interrupts when restoring affinity
References: git-fixes
Git-commit: a60dd06af674d3bb76b40da5d722e4a0ecefe650
Patch-mainline: 6.10-rc1

irq_restore_affinity_of_irq() restarts managed interrupts unconditionally
when the first CPU in the affinity mask comes online. That's correct during
normal hotplug operations, but not when resuming from S3 because the
drivers are not resumed yet and interrupt delivery is not expected by them.

Skip the startup of suspended interrupts and let resume_device_irqs() deal
with restoring them. This ensures that irqs are not delivered to drivers
during the noirq phase of resuming from S3, after non-boot CPUs are brought
back online.

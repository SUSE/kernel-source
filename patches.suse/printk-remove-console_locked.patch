Subject: [PATCH] printk: remove @console_locked

References: SLE Realtime Extension
Patch-mainline: v5.20-rc1
Git-commit: b65b2fa0de17405c1ae1a2fe6956fa42148df8fc

The static global variable @console_locked is used to help debug
VT code to make sure that certain code paths are running with
the console_lock held. However, this information is also available
with the static global variable @console_kthreads_blocked (for
locking via console_lock()), and the static global variable
@console_kthreads_active (for locking via console_trylock()).

Remove @console_locked and update is_console_locked() to use the
alternative variables.

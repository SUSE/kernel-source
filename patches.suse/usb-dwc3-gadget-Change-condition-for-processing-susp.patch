Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Change condition for processing suspend event
Git-commit: 4decf4060ecfee1f7a710999fcd421645ac0c419
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

Currently we process the suspend interrupt event only if the
device is in configured state. Consider a case where device
is not configured and got suspend interrupt, in that case our
gadget will still use 100mA as composite_suspend didn't happen.
But battery charging specification (BC1.2) expects a downstream
device to draw less than 2.5mA when unconnected OR suspended.

Fix this by removing the condition for processing suspend event,
and thus composite_resume would set vbus draw to 2.

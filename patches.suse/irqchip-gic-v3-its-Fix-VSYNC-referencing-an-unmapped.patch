Subject: irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix VSYNC referencing an unmapped VPE on GIC v4.1
References: git-fixes
Git-commit: 80e9963fb3b5509dfcabe9652d56bf4b35542055
Patch-mainline: 6.9-rc4

As per the GICv4.1 spec (Arm IHI 0069H, 5.3.19):

 "A VMAPP with {V, Alloc}=={0, x} is self-synchronizing, This means the ITS
  command queue does not show the command as consumed until all of its
  effects are completed."

Furthermore, VSYNC is allowed to deliver an SError when referencing a
non existent VPE.

By these definitions, a VMAPP followed by a VSYNC is a bug, as the
later references a VPE that has been unmapped by the former.

Fix it by eliding the VSYNC in this scenario.

Fixes: 64edfaa9a234 ("irqchip/gic-v4.1: Implement the v4.1 flavour of VMAPP")

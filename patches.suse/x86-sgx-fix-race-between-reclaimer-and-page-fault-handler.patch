Subject: x86/sgx: Fix race between reclaimer and page fault handler
Git-commit: af117837ceb9a78e995804ade4726ad2c2c8981f
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Haitao reported encountering a WARN triggered by the ENCLS[ELDU]
instruction faulting with a #GP.

The WARN is encountered when the reclaimer evicts a range of
pages from the enclave when the same pages are faulted back right away.

Consider two enclave pages (ENCLAVE_A and ENCLAVE_B)
sharing a PCMD page (PCMD_AB). ENCLAVE_A is in the
enclave memory and ENCLAVE_B is in the backing store. PCMD_AB contains
just one entry, that of ENCLAVE_B.

Scenario proceeds where ENCLAVE_A is being evicted from the enclave
while ENCLAVE_B is faulted in.

sgx_reclaim_pages() {

  ...

  /*
   * Reclaim ENCLAVE_A
   */
  mutex_lock(&encl->lock);
  /*
   * Get a reference to ENCLAVE_A's
   * shmem page where enclave page
   * encrypted data will be stored
   * as well as a reference to the
   * enclave page's PCMD data page,
   * PCMD_AB.
   * Release mutex before writing
   * any data to the shmem pages.
   */
  sgx_encl_get_backing(...);
  encl_page->desc |= SGX_ENCL_PAGE_BEING_RECLAIMED;
  mutex_unlock(&encl->lock);

                                    /*
                                     * Fault ENCLAVE_B

                                    sgx_vma_fault() {

                                      mutex_lock(&encl->lock);

                                      */
                                     /* Truncate ENCLAVE_B backing page */
                                     sgx_encl_truncate_backing_page();
                                     /* Truncate PCMD_AB */
                                     sgx_encl_truncate_backing_page();

                                     mutex_unlock(&encl->lock);

                                     ...
                                     }
  mutex_lock(&encl->lock);
  encl_page->desc &=
       ~SGX_ENCL_PAGE_BEING_RECLAIMED;
  /*
  * Write encrypted contents of
  * ENCLAVE_A to ENCLAVE_A shmem
  * page and its PCMD data to
  * PCMD_AB.
  */
  sgx_encl_put_backing(...)

  /*
   * Reference to PCMD_AB is
   * dropped and it is truncated.
   * ENCLAVE_A's PCMD data is lost.
   */
  mutex_unlock(&encl->lock);
}

What happens next depends on whether it is ENCLAVE_A being faulted
in or ENCLAVE_B being evicted - but both end up with ENCLS[ELDU] faulting
with a #GP.

If ENCLAVE_A is faulted then at the time sgx_encl_get_backing() is called
a new PCMD page is allocated and providing the empty PCMD data for
ENCLAVE_A would cause ENCLS[ELDU] to #GP

If ENCLAVE_B is evicted first then a new PCMD_AB would be allocated by the
reclaimer but later when ENCLAVE_A is faulted the ENCLS[ELDU] instruction
would #GP during its checks of the PCMD value and the WARN would be
encountered.

Noting that the reclaimer sets SGX_ENCL_PAGE_BEING_RECLAIMED at the time
it obtains a reference to the backing store pages of an enclave page it
is in the process of reclaiming, fix the race by only truncating the PCMD
page after ensuring that no page sharing the PCMD page is in the process
of being reclaimed.

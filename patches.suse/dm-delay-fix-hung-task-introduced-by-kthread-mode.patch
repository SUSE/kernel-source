Subject: dm-delay: fix hung task introduced by kthread mode
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
Git-commit: d14646f23300a5fc85be867bafdc0702c2002789
References: git-fixes

If the worker thread is not woken due to a bio, then it is not woken at
all. This causes the hung task check to trigger. This occurs, for
instance, when no bios are submitted. Also when a delay of 0 is
configured, delay_bio() returns without waking the worker.

Prevent the hung task check from triggering by creating the thread with
kthread_run() instead of using kthread_create() directly.

Fixes: 70bbeb29fab0 ("dm delay: for short delays, use kthread instead of timers and wq")

Subject: ring-buffer: Fix resetting of shortest_full
Git-commit: 68282dd930ea38b068ce2c109d12405f40df3f93
Patch-mainline: v6.8
References: git-fixes

The "shortest_full" variable is used to keep track of the waiter that is
waiting for the smallest amount on the ring buffer before being woken up.
When a tasks waits on the ring buffer, it passes in a "full" value that is
a percentage. 0 means wake up on any data. 1-100 means wake up from 1% to
100% full buffer.

As all waiters are on the same wait queue, the wake up happens for the
waiter with the smallest percentage.

The problem is that the smallest_full on the cpu_buffer that stores the
smallest amount doesn't get reset when all the waiters are woken up. It
does get reset when the ring buffer is reset (echo > /sys/kernel/tracing/trace).

This means that tasks may be woken up more often then when they want to
be. Instead, have the shortest_full field get reset just before waking up
all the tasks. If the tasks wait again, they will update the shortest_full
before sleeping.

Also add locking around setting of shortest_full in the poll logic, and
change "work" to "rbwork" to match the variable name for rb_irq_work
structures that are used in other places.

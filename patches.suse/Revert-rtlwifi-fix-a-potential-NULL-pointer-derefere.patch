Subject: [PATCH] Revert "rtlwifi: fix a potential NULL pointer dereference"
Git-commit: 68c5634c4a7278672a3bed00eb5646884257c413
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc3

This reverts commit 765976285a8c8db3f0eb7f033829a899d0c2786e.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

This commit is not correct, it should not have used unlikely() and is
not propagating the error properly to the calling function, so it should
be reverted at this point in time.  Also, if the check failed, the
work queue was still assumed to be allocated, so further accesses would
have continued to fail, meaning this patch does nothing to solve the
root issues at all.

Subject: [PATCH] w1: w1_therm: fixes w1_seq for ds28ea00 sensors
Git-commit: 41a92a89eee819298f805c40187ad8b02bb53426
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

w1_seq was failing due to several devices responding to the
CHAIN_DONE at the same time. Now properly selects the current
device in the chain with MATCH_ROM. Also acknowledgment was
read twice.

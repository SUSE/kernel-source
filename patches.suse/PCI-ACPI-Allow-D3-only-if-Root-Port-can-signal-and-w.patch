Subject: [PATCH] PCI/ACPI: Allow D3 only if Root Port can signal and wake from D3
Git-commit: dff6139015dc68e93be3822a7bd406a1d138628b
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

acpi_pci_bridge_d3(dev) returns "true" if "dev" is a hotplug bridge that
can handle hotplug events while in D3.  Previously this meant either:

  - "dev" has a _PS0 or _PR0 method (acpi_pci_power_manageable()), or

  - The Root Port above "dev" has a _DSD with a "HotPlugSupportInD3"
    property with value 1.

This did not consider _PRW, which tells us about wakeup GPEs (ACPI v6.4,
sec 7.3.13).  Without a wakeup GPE, from an ACPI perspective the Root Port
has no way of generating wakeup signals, so hotplug events will be lost if
we use D3.

Similarly, it did not consider _S0W, which tells us the deepest D-state
from which a device can wake itself (sec 7.3.20).  If _S0W tells us the
device cannot wake from D3, hotplug events will again be lost if we use D3.

Some platforms, e.g., AMD Yellow Carp, supply "HotPlugSupportInD3" without
_PRW or with an _S0W that says the Root Port cannot wake from D3.  On those
platforms, we previously put bridges in D3hot, hotplug events were lost,
and hotplugged devices would not be recognized without manually rescanning.

Allow bridges to be put in D3 only if the Root Port can generate wakeup
GPEs (wakeup.flags.valid), it can wake from D3 (_S0W), AND it has the
"HotPlugSupportInD3" property.

Neither Windows 10 nor Windows 11 puts the bridge in D3 when the firmware
is configured this way, and this change aligns the handling of the
situation to be the same.

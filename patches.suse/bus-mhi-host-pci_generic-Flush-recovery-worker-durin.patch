Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Flush recovery worker during freeze
Git-commit: c38f83bae4037023827c85e045841d0421f85034
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc5
References: bsc#1206451

It is possible that the recovery work might be running while the freeze
gets executed (during hibernation etc.,). Currently, we don't powerdown
the stack if it is not up but if the recovery work completes after freeze,
then the device will be up afterwards. This will not be a sane situation.

So let's flush the recovery worker before trying to powerdown the device.

Subject: [PATCH] xen-netback: correct success/error reporting for the
 SKB-with-fraglist case

When re-entering the main loop of xenvif_tx_check_gop() a 2nd time, the
special considerations for the head of the SKB no longer apply. Don't
mistakenly report ERROR to the frontend for the first entry in the list,
even if - from all I can tell - this shouldn't matter much as the overall
transmit will need to be considered failed anyway.

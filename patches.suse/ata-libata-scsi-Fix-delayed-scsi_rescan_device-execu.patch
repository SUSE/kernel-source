Subject: [PATCH] ata: libata-scsi: Fix delayed scsi_rescan_device() execution
Git-commit: 8b4d9469d0b0e553208ee6f62f2807111fde18b9
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc4
References: git-fixes

Commit 6aa0365a3c85 ("ata: libata-scsi: Avoid deadlock on rescan after
device resume") modified ata_scsi_dev_rescan() to check the scsi device
"is_suspended" power field to ensure that the scsi device associated
with an ATA device is fully resumed when scsi_rescan_device() is
executed. However, this fix is problematic as:
1) It relies on a PM internal field that should not be used without PM
   device locking protection.
2) The check for is_suspended and the call to scsi_rescan_device() are
   not atomic and a suspend PM event may be triggered between them,
   casuing scsi_rescan_device() to be called on a suspended device and
   in that function blocking while holding the scsi device lock. This
   would deadlock a following resume operation.
These problems can trigger PM deadlocks on resume, especially with
resume operations triggered quickly after or during suspend operations.
E.g., a simple bash script like:

for (( i=0; i<10; i++ )); do
	echo "+2 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
	echo mem > /sys/power/state
done

that triggers a resume 2 seconds after starting suspending a system can
quickly lead to a PM deadlock preventing the system from correctly
resuming.

Fix this by replacing the check on is_suspended with a check on the
return value given by scsi_rescan_device() as that function will fail if
called against a suspended device. Also make sure rescan tasks already
scheduled are first cancelled before suspending an ata port.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rt5682: Disable irq on shutdown
Git-commit: 47bcb1c7108363418cd578283333d72e310dfeaa
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

We cancel the work queues, and reset the device on shutdown, but the irq
isn't disabled so the work queues could be queued again. Let's disable
the irq during shutdown so that we don't have to worry about this device
trying to do anything anymore. This fixes a problem seen where the i2c
bus is shutdown at reboot but this device irq still comes in and tries
to make another i2c transaction when the bus doesn't work.

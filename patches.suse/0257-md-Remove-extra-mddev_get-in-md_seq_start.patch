Subject: [PATCH] md: Remove extra mddev_get() in md_seq_start()
Git-commit: 3bfc3bcd787c48aa31e4fde4a6dfcef4cd7ee2c2
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: jsc#PED-2766

A regression is seen where mddev devices stay permanently after they
are stopped due to an elevated reference count.

This was tracked down to an extra mddev_get() in md_seq_start().

It only happened rarely because most of the time the md_seq_start()
is called with a zero offset. The path with an extra mddev_get() only
happens when it starts with a non-zero offset.

The commit noted below changed an mddev_get() to check its success
but inadvertently left the original call in. Remove the extra call.

Fixes: 12a6caf27324 ("md: only delete entries from all_mddevs when the disk is freed")

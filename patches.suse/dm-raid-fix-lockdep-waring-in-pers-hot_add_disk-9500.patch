Subject: [PATCH] dm-raid: fix lockdep waring in "pers->hot_add_disk"
Git-commit: 95009ae904b1e9dca8db6f649f2d7c18a6e42c75
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

The lockdep assert is added by commit a448af25becf ("md/raid10: remove
rcu protection to access rdev from conf") in print_conf(). And I didn't
notice that dm-raid is calling "pers->hot_add_disk" without holding
'reconfig_mutex'.

"pers->hot_add_disk" read and write many fields that is protected by
'reconfig_mutex', and raid_resume() already grab the lock in other
contex. Hence fix this problem by protecting "pers->host_add_disk"
with the lock.

Fixes: 9092c02d9435 ("DM RAID: Add ability to restore transiently failed devices on resume")
Fixes: a448af25becf ("md/raid10: remove rcu protection to access rdev from conf")

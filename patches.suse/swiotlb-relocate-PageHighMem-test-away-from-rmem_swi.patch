Subject: [PATCH] swiotlb: relocate PageHighMem test away from
 rmem_swiotlb_setup
Git-commit: a90922fa25370902322e9de6640e58737d459a50
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1

The reservedmem_of_init_fn's are invoked very early at boot before the
memory zones have even been defined. This makes it inappropriate to test
whether the page corresponding to a PFN is in ZONE_HIGHMEM from within
one.

Removing the check allows an ARM 32-bit kernel with SPARSEMEM enabled to
boot properly since otherwise we would be de-referencing an
uninitialized sparsemem map to perform pfn_to_page() check.

The arm64 architecture happens to work (and also has no high memory) but
other 32-bit architectures could also be having similar issues.

While it would be nice to provide early feedback about a reserved DMA
pool residing in highmem, it is not possible to do that until the first
time we try to use it, which is where the check is moved to.

Subject: [PATCH 09/18] crypto: dh - implement private key generation primitive
References: jsc#SLE-21132,bsc#1191256
Patch-mainline: Submitted, linux-crypto ML

The support for NVME in-band authentication currently in the works ([1])
needs to generate ephemeral DH keys.

Implement crypto_dh_gen_privkey() which is intended to be used from
the DH implementations just in analogy to how ecc_gen_privkey() is used
for ECDH.

Make the new crypto_dh_gen_privkey() to follow the approach specified
in SP800-56Arev3, sec. 5.6.1.1.3 ("Key-Pair Generation Using Extra Random
Bits").

SP800-56Arev3 specifies a lower as well as an upper bound on the generated
key's length:
- it must be >= two times the maximum supported security strength of
  the group in question and
- it must be <= the length of the domain parameter Q.
Both of these are available only for the safe-prime groups from
RFC 3526 or RFC 7919, which had been introduced to the kernel with previous
patches: for any safe-prime group Q = (P - 1)/2 by definition and the
individual maximum supported security strength as specified by
SP800-56Arev3 has already been made available alongside the resp. domain
parameters with said previous patches. Restrict crypto_dh_gen_privkey() to
these safe-prime groups, i.e. to those groups with any group_id but
DH_GROUP_ID_UNKNOWN. Make it pick twice the maximum supported strength
rounded up to the next power of two for the output key size. This choice
respects both, the lower and upper bounds given by SP800-90Arev3 for
all safe-prime groups known to the kernel by now and is also in line with
the NVME base spec 2.0, which requires the key size to be >= 256bits.

Subject: [PATCH] USB: cdc-acm: blacklist Heimann USB Appset device
Git-commit: 4897807753e078655a78de39ed76044d784f3e63
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

The device (32a7:0000 Heimann Sensor GmbH USB appset demo) claims to be
a CDC-ACM device in its descriptors but in fact is not. If it is run
with echo disabled it returns garbled data, probably due to something
that happens in the TTY layer. And when run with echo enabled (the
default), it will mess up the calibration data of the sensor the first
time any data is sent to the device.

In short, I had a bad time after connecting the sensor and trying to get
it to work. I hope blacklisting it in the cdc-acm driver will save
someone else a bit of trouble.

Subject: iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Fix size calculation in
 arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range()
Git-commit: 95d4782c34a60800ccf91d9f0703137d4367a2fc
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc6
References: git-fixes

The arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range function is designed to be called
by mm core for Shared Virtual Addressing purpose between IOMMU and
CPU MMU. However, the ways of two subsystems defining their "end"
addresses are slightly different. IOMMU defines its "end" address
using the last address of an address range, while mm core defines
that using the following address of an address range:

	include/linux/mm_types.h:
		unsigned long vm_end;
		/* The first byte after our end address ...

This mismatch resulted in an incorrect calculation for size so it
failed to be page-size aligned. Further, it caused a dead loop at
"while (iova < end)" check in __arm_smmu_tlb_inv_range function.

This patch fixes the issue by doing the calculation correctly.

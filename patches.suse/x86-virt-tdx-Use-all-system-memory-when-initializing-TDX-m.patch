Subject: x86/virt/tdx: Use all system memory when initializing TDX module as
 TDX memory
Git-commit: abe8dbab8f9f8370c26e7b79b49ed795c1b6b70f
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: jsc#PED-5824

Start to transit out the "multi-steps" to initialize the TDX module.

TDX provides increased levels of memory confidentiality and integrity.
This requires special hardware support for features like memory
encryption and storage of memory integrity checksums.  Not all memory
satisfies these requirements.

As a result, TDX introduced the concept of a "Convertible Memory Region"
(CMR).  During boot, the firmware builds a list of all of the memory
ranges which can provide the TDX security guarantees.  The list of these
ranges is available to the kernel by querying the TDX module.

CMRs tell the kernel which memory is TDX compatible.  The kernel needs
to build a list of memory regions (out of CMRs) as "TDX-usable" memory
and pass them to the TDX module.  Once this is done, those "TDX-usable"
memory regions are fixed during module's lifetime.

To keep things simple, assume that all TDX-protected memory will come
from the page allocator.  Make sure all pages in the page allocator
*are* TDX-usable memory.

As TDX-usable memory is a fixed configuration, take a snapshot of the
memory configuration from memblocks at the time of module initialization
(memblocks are modified on memory hotplug).  This snapshot is used to
enable TDX support for *this* memory configuration only.  Use a memory
hotplug notifier to ensure that no other RAM can be added outside of
this configuration.

This approach requires all memblock memory regions at the time of module
initialization to be TDX convertible memory to work, otherwise module
initialization will fail in a later SEAMCALL when passing those regions
to the module.  This approach works when all boot-time "system RAM" is
TDX convertible memory and no non-TDX-convertible memory is hot-added
to the core-mm before module initialization.

For instance, on the first generation of TDX machines, both CXL memory
and NVDIMM are not TDX convertible memory.  Using kmem driver to hot-add
any CXL memory or NVDIMM to the core-mm before module initialization
will result in failure to initialize the module.  The SEAMCALL error
code will be available in the dmesg to help user to understand the
failure.

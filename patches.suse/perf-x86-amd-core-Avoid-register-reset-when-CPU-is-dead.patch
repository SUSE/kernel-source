Subject: perf/x86/amd/core: Avoid register reset when CPU is dead
Git-commit: ad8c91282c95f801c37812d59d2d9eba6899b384
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

When bringing a CPU online, some of the PMC and LBR related registers
are reset. The same is done when a CPU is taken offline although that
is unnecessary. This currently happens in the "cpu_dead" callback which
is also incorrect as the callback runs on a control CPU instead of the
one that is being taken offline. This also affects hibernation and
suspend to RAM on some platforms as reported in the link below.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: vgic-v2: Use cpuid from userspace as vcpu_id

When parsing a GICv2 attribute that contains a cpuid, handle this
as the vcpu_id, not a vcpu_idx, as userspace cannot really know
the mapping between the two. For this, use kvm_get_vcpu_by_id()
instead of kvm_get_vcpu().

Take this opportunity to get rid of the pointless check against
online_vcpus, which doesn't make much sense either, and switch
to FIELD_GET as a way to extract the vcpu_id.

Subject: [PATCH] bcache: don't pass a stack address to blkdev_get_by_path
Git-commit: 29499ab060fec044161be73fb0e448eab97b4813
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: bsc#1218785

sb is just an on-stack pointer that can easily be reused by other calls.
Switch to use the bcache-wide bcache_kobj instead as there is no need to
claim per-bcache device anyway.

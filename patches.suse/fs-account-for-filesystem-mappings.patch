Subject: [PATCH 3/5] fs: account for filesystem mappings
Git-commit: 1ac2a4104968e0a60b4b3572216a92aab5c1b025
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsc#1205191

Currently we only support idmapped mounts for filesystems mounted
without an idmapping. This was a conscious decision mentioned in
multiple places (cf. e.g. [1]).

As explained at length in [3] it is perfectly fine to extend support for
idmapped mounts to filesystem's mounted with an idmapping should the
need arise. The need has been there for some time now. Various container
projects in userspace need this to run unprivileged and nested
unprivileged containers (cf. [2]).

Before we can port any filesystem that is mountable with an idmapping to
support idmapped mounts we need to first extend the mapping helpers to
account for the filesystem's idmapping. This again, is explained at
length in our documentation at [3] but I'll give an overview here again.

Currently, the low-level mapping helpers implement the remapping
algorithms described in [3] in a simplified manner. Because we could
rely on the fact that all filesystems supporting idmapped mounts are
mounted without an idmapping the translation step from or into the
filesystem idmapping could be skipped.

In order to support idmapped mounts of filesystem's mountable with an
idmapping the translation step we were able to skip before cannot be
skipped anymore. A filesystem mounted with an idmapping is very likely
to not use an identity mapping and will instead use a non-identity
mapping. So the translation step from or into the filesystem's idmapping
in the remapping algorithm cannot be skipped for such filesystems. More
details with examples can be found in [3].

This patch adds a few new and prepares some already existing low-level
mapping helpers to perform the full translation algorithm explained in
[3]. The low-level helpers can be written in a way that they only
perform the additional translation step when the filesystem is indeed
mounted with an idmapping.

If the low-level helpers detect that they are not dealing with an
idmapped mount they can simply return the relevant k{g,u}id unchanged;
no remapping needs to be performed at all. The no_idmapping() helper
detects whether the shortcut can be used.

If the low-level helpers detected that they are dealing with an idmapped
mount but the underlying filesystem is mounted without an idmapping we
can rely on the previous shorcut and can continue to skip the
translation step from or into the filesystem's idmapping.

These checks guarantee that only the minimal amount of work is
performed. As before, if idmapped mounts aren't used the low-level
helpers are idempotent and no work is performed at all.

This patch adds the helpers mapped_k{g,u}id_fs() and
mapped_k{g,u}id_user(). Following patches will port all places to
replace the old k{g,u}id_into_mnt() and k{g,u}id_from_mnt() with these
two new helpers. After the conversion is done k{g,u}id_into_mnt() and
k{g,u}id_from_mnt() will be removed. This also concludes the renaming of
the mapping helpers we started in [4]. Now, all mapping helpers will
started with the "mapped_" prefix making everything nice and consistent.

The mapped_k{g,u}id_fs() helpers replace the k{g,u}id_into_mnt()
helpers. They are to be used when k{g,u}ids are to be mapped from the
vfs, e.g. from from struct inode's i_{g,u}id.  Conversely, the
mapped_k{g,u}id_user() helpers replace the k{g,u}id_from_mnt() helpers.
They are to be used when k{g,u}ids are to be written to disk, e.g. when
entering from a system call to change ownership of a file.

This patch only introduces the helpers. It doesn't yet convert the
relevant places to account for filesystem mounted with an idmapping.

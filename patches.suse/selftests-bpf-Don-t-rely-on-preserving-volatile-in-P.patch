Subject: selftests/bpf: Don't rely on preserving volatile in PT_REGS macros in
 loop3
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: 70bc793382a0e37ba4e35e4d1a317b280b829a44
References: jsc#PED-1368

PT_REGS*() macro on some architectures force-cast struct pt_regs to
other types (user_pt_regs, etc) and might drop volatile modifiers, if any.
Volatile isn't really required as pt_regs value isn't supposed to change
during the BPF program run, so this is correct behavior.

But progs/loop3.c relies on that volatile modifier to ensure that loop
is preserved. Fix loop3.c by declaring i and sum variables as volatile
instead. It preserves the loop and makes the test pass on all
architectures (including s390x which is currently broken).

Fixes: 3cc31d794097 ("libbpf: Normalize PT_REGS_xxx() macro definitions")

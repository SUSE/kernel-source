 doesn't reach

When expanding a file system from (16TiB-2MiB) to 18TiB, the operation
exits early which leads to result inconsistency between resize2fs and
Ext4 kernel driver.

=== before ===
○ → resize2fs /dev/mapper/thin
resize2fs 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)
Filesystem at /dev/mapper/thin is mounted on /mnt/test; on-line resizing required
old_desc_blocks = 2048, new_desc_blocks = 2304
The filesystem on /dev/mapper/thin is now 4831837696 (4k) blocks long.

Subject: scsi: lpfc: Handle duplicate D_IDs in ndlp search-by D_ID routine
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
Git-commit: 56c3d809b7b450379162d0b8a70bbe71ab8db706
References: bsc#1238347

After a port swap between separate fabrics, there may be multiple nodes in
the vport's fc_nodes list with the same fabric well known address.
Duplication is temporary and eventually resolves itself after dev_loss_tmo
expires, but nameserver queries may still occur before dev_loss_tmo.  This
possibly results in returning stale fabric ndlp objects.  Fix by adding an
nlp_state check to ensure the ndlp search routine returns the correct newer
allocated ndlp fabric object.

Subject: [PATCH] printk: Avoid false positive lockdep report for legacy
 printing

References: bsc#1232534 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
Git-commit: daeed1595b4ddf314bad8ee40b2662e03fd012dc

Legacy console printing from printk() caller context may invoke
the console driver from atomic context. This leads to a lockdep
splat because the console driver will acquire a sleeping lock
and the caller may already hold a spinning lock. This is noticed
by lockdep on !PREEMPT_RT configurations because it will lead to
a problem on PREEMPT_RT.

However, on PREEMPT_RT the printing path from atomic context is
always avoided and the console driver is always invoked from a
dedicated thread. Thus the lockdep splat on !PREEMPT_RT is a
false positive.

For !PREEMPT_RT override the lock-context before invoking the
console driver to avoid the false positive.

Do not override the lock-context for PREEMPT_RT in order to
allow lockdep to catch any real locking context issues related
to the write callback usage.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: Fix OpenBMC flash layout label addresses
Git-commit: e011df3579ac980d840db8e8c3b9431f88ebddab
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

We've ended up with some inconsistencies between the addresses in the
DT node labels and the actual offsets of the partitions; this brings
them back in sync.

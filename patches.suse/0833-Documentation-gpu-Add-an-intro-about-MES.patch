+
+Every GFX has a pipe component with one or more hardware queues. Pipes can
+switch between queues depending on certain conditions, and one of the
+components that can request a queue switch to a pipe is the MicroEngine
+Scheduler (MES). Whenever the driver is initialized, it creates one MQD per
+hardware queue, and then the MQDs are handed to the MES firmware for mapping
+to:
+
+1. Kernel Queues (legacy): This queue is statically mapped to HQDs and never
+   preempted. Even though this is a legacy feature, it is the current default, and
+   most existing hardware supports it. When an application submits work to the
+   kernel driver, it submits all of the application command buffers to the kernel
+   queues. The CS IOCTL takes the command buffer from the applications and
+   schedules them on the kernel queue.
+
+2. User Queues: These queues are dynamically mapped to the HQDs. Regarding the
+   utilization of User Queues, the userspace application will create its user
+   queues and submit work directly to its user queues with no need to IOCTL for
+   each submission and no need to share a single kernel queue.
+
+In terms of User Queues, MES can dynamically map them to the HQD. If there are
+more MQDs than HQDs, the MES firmware will preempt other user queues to make
+sure each queues get a time slice; in other words, MES is a microcontroller
+that handles the mapping and unmapping of MQDs into HQDs, as well as the
+priorities and oversubscription of MQDs.

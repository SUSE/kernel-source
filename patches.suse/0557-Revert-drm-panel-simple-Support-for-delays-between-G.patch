Subject: Revert "drm/panel-simple: Support for delays between GPIO &
 regulator"
Git-commit: 81c3212dd5fbd5274e673c4fb3bf60879d020b35
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

This reverts commit 18a1488bf1e13fc3fc96d7948466b2166067c6c8.

Those delays were added to support the Samsung ATNA33XC20
panel. However, we've moving that to its own panel driver and out of
panel-simple. That means we don't need the ability to specify this
delay.

NOTE: it's unlikely we want to keep this delay "just in case" some
other panel needs it. The enable-gpio and the power supply are really
supposed to be different ways to specify the same thing: the main
enable of the panel. Supporting a delay between them doesn't really
make sense.

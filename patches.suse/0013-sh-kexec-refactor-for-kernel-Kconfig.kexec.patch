Subject: [PATCH 13/15] sh/kexec: refactor for kernel/Kconfig.kexec
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
Git-commit: 40445d060152845f9023f5404d4b5f7bd7f11f39
References: jsc#PED-5077

The kexec and crash kernel options are provided in the common
kernel/Kconfig.kexec. Utilize the common options and provide
the ARCH_SUPPORTS_ and ARCH_SELECTS_ entries to recreate the
equivalent set of KEXEC and CRASH options.

-	help
-	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
-	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
-	  but it is independent of the system firmware.  And like a reboot
-	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.
-
-	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.
-
-	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
-	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
-	  initially work for you.  As of this writing the exact hardware
-	  interface is strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be
-	  made.

-	help
-	  Generate crash dump after being started by kexec.
-	  This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels
-	  which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into
-	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
-	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled
-	  to a memory address not used by the main kernel using
-	  PHYSICAL_START.

Subject: khugepaged: retract_page_tables() remember to test exit
Git-commit: 18e77600f7a1ed69f8ce46c9e11cad0985712dfa
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: CVE-2022-48991 bsc#1232070 prerequisity

Only once have I seen this scenario (and forgot even to notice what forced
the eventual crash): a sequence of "BUG: Bad page map" alerts from
vm_normal_page(), from zap_pte_range() servicing exit_mmap();
pmd:00000000, pte values corresponding to data in physical page 0.

The pte mappings being zapped in this case were supposed to be from a huge
page of ext4 text (but could as well have been shmem): my belief is that
it was racing with collapse_file()'s retract_page_tables(), found *pmd
pointing to a page table, locked it, but *pmd had become 0 by the time
start_pte was decided.

In most cases, that possibility is excluded by holding mmap lock; but
exit_mmap() proceeds without mmap lock.  Most of what's run by khugepaged
checks khugepaged_test_exit() after acquiring mmap lock:
khugepaged_collapse_pte_mapped_thps() and hugepage_vma_revalidate() do so,
for example.  But retract_page_tables() did not: fix that.

The fix is for retract_page_tables() to check khugepaged_test_exit(),
after acquiring mmap lock, before doing anything to the page table.
Getting the mmap lock serializes with __mmput(), which briefly takes and
drops it in __khugepaged_exit(); then the khugepaged_test_exit() check on
mm_users makes sure we don't touch the page table once exit_mmap() might
reach it, since exit_mmap() will be proceeding without mmap lock, not
expecting anyone to be racing with it.

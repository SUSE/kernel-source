Subject: xfrm: enforce validity of offload input flags
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc7
Git-commit: 7c76ecd9c99b6e9a771d813ab1aa7fa428b3ade1
References: jsc#PED-373

struct xfrm_user_offload has flags variable that received user input,
but kernel didn't check if valid bits were provided. It caused a situation
where not sanitized input was forwarded directly to the drivers.

For example, XFRM_OFFLOAD_IPV6 define that was exposed, was used by
strongswan, but not implemented in the kernel at all.

As a solution, check and sanitize input flags to forward
XFRM_OFFLOAD_INBOUND to the drivers.

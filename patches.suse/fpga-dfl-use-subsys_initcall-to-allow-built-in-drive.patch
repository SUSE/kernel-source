Subject: [PATCH] fpga: dfl: use subsys_initcall to allow built-in drivers to be added
Git-commit: 267f53140c9d0bf270bbe0148082e9b8e5011273
Patch-mainline: v7.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

The dfl code adds a bus. If it is built-in and there is a built-in driver
as well, the dfl module_init may be called after the driver module_init,
leading to a failure to register the driver as the bus has not been added
yet.

Use subsys_initcall, which guarantees it will be called before the drivers
init code.

Without the fix, we see failures like this:

[    0.479475] Driver 'intel-m10-bmc' was unable to register with bus_type 'dfl' because the bus was not initialized.

Subject: drm/vc4: dsi: Correct DSI divider calculations
Git-commit: 3b45eee87da171caa28f61240ddb5c21170cda53
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

The divider calculations tried to find the divider just faster than the
clock requested. However if it required a divider of 7 then the for loop
aborted without handling the "error" case, and could end up with a clock
lower than requested.

The integer divider from parent PLL to DSI clock is also capable of
going up to /255, not just /7 that the driver was trying.  This allows
for slower link frequencies on the DSI bus where the resolution permits.

Correct the loop so that we always have a clock greater than requested,
and covering the whole range of dividers.

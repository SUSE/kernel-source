Subject: [PATCH 16/34] net: mscc: ocelot: restrict tc-trap actions to VCAP IS2
 lookup 0
Git-commit: 477d2b91623e682e9a8126ea92acb8f684969cc7
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc7
References: git-fixes

Once the CPU port was added to the destination port mask of a packet, it
can never be cleared, so even packets marked as dropped by the MASK_MODE
of a VCAP IS2 filter will still reach it. This is why we need the
OCELOT_POLICER_DISCARD to "kill dropped packets dead" and make software
stop seeing them.

We disallow policer rules from being put on any other chain than the one
for the first lookup, but we don't do this for "drop" rules, although we
should. This change is merely ascertaining that the rules dont't
(completely) work and letting the user know.

The blamed commit is the one that introduced the multi-chain architecture
in ocelot. Prior to that, we should have always offloaded the filters to
VCAP IS2 lookup 0, where they did work.

Subject: ring-buffer: Fix waking up ring buffer readers
Git-commit: b3594573681b53316ec0365332681a30463edfd6
Patch-mainline: v6.8
References: git-fixes

A task can wait on a ring buffer for when it fills up to a specific
watermark. The writer will check the minimum watermark that waiters are
waiting for and if the ring buffer is past that, it will wake up all the
waiters.

The waiters are in a wait loop, and will first check if a signal is
pending and then check if the ring buffer is at the desired level where it
should break out of the loop.

If a file that uses a ring buffer closes, and there's threads waiting on
the ring buffer, it needs to wake up those threads. To do this, a
"wait_index" was used.

Before entering the wait loop, the waiter will read the wait_index. On
wakeup, it will check if the wait_index is different than when it entered
the loop, and will exit the loop if it is. The waker will only need to
update the wait_index before waking up the waiters.

This had a couple of bugs. One trivial one and one broken by design.

The trivial bug was that the waiter checked the wait_index after the
schedule() call. It had to be checked between the prepare_to_wait() and
the schedule() which it was not.

The main bug is that the first check to set the default wait_index will
always be outside the prepare_to_wait() and the schedule(). That's because
the ring_buffer_wait() doesn't have enough context to know if it should
break out of the loop.

The loop itself is not needed, because all the callers to the
ring_buffer_wait() also has their own loop, as the callers have a better
sense of what the context is to decide whether to break out of the loop
or not.

Just have the ring_buffer_wait() block once, and if it gets woken up, exit
the function and let the callers decide what to do next.

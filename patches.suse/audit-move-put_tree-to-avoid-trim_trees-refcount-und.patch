Subject: [PATCH] audit: move put_tree() to avoid trim_trees refcount underflow and UAF
Git-commit: 67d69e9d1a6c889d98951c1d74b19332ce0565af
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: stable-5.14.1

commit 67d69e9d1a6c889d98951c1d74b19332ce0565af upstream.

AUDIT_TRIM is expected to be idempotent, but multiple executions resulted
in a refcount underflow and use-after-free.

git bisect fingered commit fb041bb7c0a9	("locking/refcount: Consolidate
implementations of refcount_t") but this patch with its more thorough
checking that wasn't in the x86 assembly code merely exposed a previously
existing tree refcount imbalance in the case of tree trimming code that
was refactored with prune_one() to remove a tree introduced in
commit 8432c7006297 ("audit: Simplify locking around untag_chunk()")

Move the put_tree() to cover only the prune_one() case.

Passes audit-testsuite and 3 passes of "auditctl -t" with at least one
directory watch.

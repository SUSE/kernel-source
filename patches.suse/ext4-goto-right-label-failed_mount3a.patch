Subject: [PATCH] ext4: goto right label 'failed_mount3a'
Git-commit: 43bd6f1b49b61f43de4d4e33661b8dbe8c911f14
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: bsc#1207610

Before these two branches neither loaded the journal nor created the
xattr cache. So the right label to goto is 'failed_mount3a'. Although
this did not cause any issues because the error handler validated if the
pointer is null. However this still made me confused when reading
the code. So it's still worth to modify to goto the right label.

Subject: drm/doc/rfc: Move userptr integration and vm_bind to the 'completed'
 section
Git-commit: 34e64dd192071c3159c118331f87c66dffa0f9c9
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

The must-have part of the documentation was already added to the existing
/gpu/drm-vm-bind-async. The other extra discussion around GPUVM helpers
are currently active in the community. None of those discussion should
block Xe since documentation, specially around locking was completed in
a community consensus.

 Xe – Pre-Merge Goals - Work-in-Progress
 =======================================
 
-Userptr integration and vm_bind
--------------------------------
-Different drivers implement different ways of dealing with execution of userptr.
-With multiple drivers currently introducing support to VM_BIND, the goal is to
-aim for a DRM consensus on what’s the best way to have that support. To some
-extent this is already getting addressed itself with the GPUVA where likely the
-userptr will be a GPUVA with a NULL GEM call VM bind directly on the userptr.
-However, there are more aspects around the rules for that and the usage of
-mmu_notifiers, locking and other aspects.
-
-This task here has the goal of introducing a documentation of the basic rules.
-
-The documentation *needs* to first live in this document (API session below) and
-then moved to another more specific document or at Xe level or at DRM level.
-
-Documentation should include:
-
- * The userptr part of the VM_BIND api.
-
- * Locking, including the page-faulting case.
-
- * O(1) complexity under VM_BIND.
-
-The document is now included in the drm documentation :doc:`here </gpu/drm-vm-bind-async>`.
-
-Some parts of userptr like mmu_notifiers should become GPUVA or DRM helpers when
-the second driver supporting VM_BIND+userptr appears. Details to be defined when
-the time comes.
-
-The DRM GPUVM helpers do not yet include the userptr parts, but discussions
-about implementing them are ongoing.

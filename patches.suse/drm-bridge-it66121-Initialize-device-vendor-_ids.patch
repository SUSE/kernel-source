Subject: drm/bridge: it66121: Initialize {device,vendor}_ids
Git-commit: 3a5f3d61de657bc1c2b53b77d065c5526f982e10
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

These two arrays are populated with data read from the I2C device
through regmap_read(), and the data is then compared with hardcoded
vendor/product ID values of supported chips.

However, the return value of regmap_read() was never checked. This is
fine, as long as the two arrays are zero-initialized, so that we don't
compare the vendor/product IDs against whatever garbage is left on the
stack.

Address this issue by zero-initializing these two arrays.

Subject: [PATCH] iomap: advance the iter directly on buffered writes
Git-commit: 1a1a3b574b979912882f19d655ddac73f5cbc159
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14161

Modify the buffered write path to advance the iter directly. Replace
the local pos and length calculations with direct advances and loop
based on iter state instead.

Also remove the -EAGAIN return hack as it is no longer necessary now
that separate return channels exist for processing progress and error
returns. For example, the existing write handler must return either a
count of bytes written or error if the write is interrupted, but
presumably wants to return -EAGAIN directly in order to break the higher
level iomap_iter() loop.

Since the current iteration may have made some progress, it unwinds the
iter on the way out to return the error while ensuring that portion of
the write can be retried. If -EAGAIN occurs at any point beyond the
first iteration, iomap_file_buffered_write() will then observe progress
based on iter->pos to return a short write.

With incremental advances on the iomap_iter, iomap_write_iter() can
simply return the error. iomap_iter() completes whatever progress was
made based on iomap_iter position and still breaks out of the iter loop
based on the error code in iter.processed. The end result of the write
is similar in terms of being a short write if progress was made or error
return otherwise.

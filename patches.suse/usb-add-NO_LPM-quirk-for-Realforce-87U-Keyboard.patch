Subject: [PATCH] usb: add NO_LPM quirk for Realforce 87U Keyboard
Git-commit: 181135bb20dcb184edd89817831b888eb8132741
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc6
References: git-fixes

Before adding this quirk, this (mechanical keyboard) device would not be
recognized, logging:

  new full-speed USB device number 56 using xhci_hcd
  unable to read config index 0 descriptor/start: -32
  chopping to 0 config(s)

It would take dozens of plugging/unpuggling cycles for the keyboard to
be recognized. Keyboard seems to simply work after applying this quirk.

This issue had been reported by users in two places already ([1], [2])
but nobody tried upstreaming a patch yet. After testing I believe their
suggested fix (DELAY_INIT + NO_LPM + DEVICE_QUALIFIER) was probably a
little overkill. I assume this particular combination was tested because
it had been previously suggested in [3], but only NO_LPM seems
sufficient for this device.

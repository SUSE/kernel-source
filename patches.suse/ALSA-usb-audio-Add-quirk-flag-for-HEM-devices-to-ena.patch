Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk flag for HEM devices to enable native DSD playback
Git-commit: 122e2cb7e1a30438cc0e8bf70d4279db245d7d5b
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc7
References: git-fixes

This commit adds new DEVICE_FLG with QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW and Vendor Id for
HEM devices which supports native DSD. Prior to this change Linux kernel
was not enabling native DSD playback for HEM devices, and as a result,
DSD audio was being converted to PCM "on the fly". HEM devices,
when connected to the system, would only play audio in PCM format,
even if the source material was in DSD format. With the addition of new
VENDOR_FLG in the quircks.c file, the devices are now correctly
recognized, and raw DSD data is transmitted to the device,
allowing for native DSD playback.

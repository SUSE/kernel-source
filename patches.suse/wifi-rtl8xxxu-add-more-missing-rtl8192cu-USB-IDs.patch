Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtl8xxxu: add more missing rtl8192cu USB IDs
Git-commit: 31be3175bd7be89e39c82b3973c9d4ff55a17583
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: stable-fixes

The rtl8xxxu has all the rtl8192cu USB IDs from rtlwifi/rtl8192cu/sw.c
except for the following 10, add these to the untested section so they
can be used with the rtl8xxxu as the rtl8192cu are well supported.

This fixes these wifi modules not working on distributions which have
disabled CONFIG_RTL8192CU replacing it with CONFIG_RTL8XXXU_UNTESTED,
like Fedora.

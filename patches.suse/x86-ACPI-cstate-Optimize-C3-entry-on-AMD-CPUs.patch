Subject: x86: ACPI: cstate: Optimize C3 entry on AMD CPUs
Git-commit: a8fb40966f19ff81520d9ccf8f7e2b95201368b8
Patch-mainline: 5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

All Zen or newer CPU which support C3 shares cache. Its not necessary to
flush the caches in software before entering C3. This will cause drop in
performance for the cores which share some caches. ARB_DIS is not used
with current AMD C state implementation. So set related flags correctly.

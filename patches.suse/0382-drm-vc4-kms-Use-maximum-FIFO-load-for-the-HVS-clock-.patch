Subject: drm/vc4: kms: Use maximum FIFO load for the HVS clock rate
Git-commit: 1701a23a4ef0993964ccc2f2d5d13f83a5ff4c70
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

The core clock computation takes into account both the load due to the
input (ie, planes) and its output (ie, encoders).

However, while the input load needs to consider all the planes, and thus
sum all of their associated loads, the output happens mostly in
parallel.

Therefore, we need to consider only the maximum of all the output loads,
and not the sum like we were doing. This resulted in a clock rate way
too high which could be discarded for being too high by the clock
framework.

Since recent changes, the clock framework will even downright reject it,
leading to a core clock being too low for its current needs.

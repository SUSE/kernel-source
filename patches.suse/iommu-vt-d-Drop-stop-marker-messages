Subject: iommu/vt-d: Drop stop marker messages
Git-commit: da8669ff41fa31573375c9a4180f5c080677204b
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc6
References: git-fixes

The page fault handling framework in the IOMMU core explicitly states
that it doesn't handle PCI PASID Stop Marker and the IOMMU drivers must
discard them before reporting faults. This handles Stop Marker messages
in prq_event_thread() before reporting events to the core.

The VT-d driver explicitly drains the pending page requests when a CPU
page table (represented by a mm struct) is unbound from a PASID according
to the procedures defined in the VT-d spec. The Stop Marker messages do
not need a response. Hence, it is safe to drop the Stop Marker messages
silently if any of them is found in the page request queue.

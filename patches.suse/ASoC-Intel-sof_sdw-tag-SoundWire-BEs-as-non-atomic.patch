Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: tag SoundWire BEs as non-atomic
Git-commit: 58eafe1ff52ee1ce255759fc15729519af180cbb
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc4
References: stable-5.14.13

[ Upstream commit 58eafe1ff52ee1ce255759fc15729519af180cbb ]

The SoundWire BEs make use of 'stream' functions for .prepare and
.trigger. These functions will in turn force a Bank Switch, which
implies a wait operation.

Mark SoundWire BEs as nonatomic for consistency, but keep all other
types of BEs as is. The initialization of .nonatomic is done outside
of the create_sdw_dailink helper to avoid adding more parameters to
deal with a single exception to the rule that BEs are atomic.

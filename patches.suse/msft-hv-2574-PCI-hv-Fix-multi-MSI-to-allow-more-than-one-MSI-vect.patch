Subject: PCI: hv: Fix multi-MSI to allow more than one MSI vector
Git-commit: 08e61e861a0e47e5e1a3fb78406afd6b0cea6b6d
References: bsc#1200845

If the allocation of multiple MSI vectors for multi-MSI fails in the core
PCI framework, the framework will retry the allocation as a single MSI
vector, assuming that meets the min_vecs specified by the requesting
driver.

Hyper-V advertises that multi-MSI is supported, but reuses the VECTOR
domain to implement that for x86.  The VECTOR domain does not support
multi-MSI, so the alloc will always fail and fallback to a single MSI
allocation.

In short, Hyper-V advertises a capability it does not implement.

Hyper-V can support multi-MSI because it coordinates with the hypervisor
to map the MSIs in the IOMMU's interrupt remapper, which is something the
VECTOR domain does not have.  Therefore the fix is simple - copy what the
x86 IOMMU drivers (AMD/Intel-IR) do by removing
X86_IRQ_ALLOC_CONTIGUOUS_VECTORS after calling the VECTOR domain's
pci_msi_prepare().

Subject: ARM: dts: exynos: correct PMIC interrupt trigger level on Midas
 family
Git-commit: e52dcd6e70fab51f53292e53336ecb007bb60889
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

The Maxim PMIC datasheets describe the interrupt line as active low
with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  Without specifying the
interrupt type in Devicetree, kernel might apply some fixed
configuration, not necessarily working for this hardware.

Additionally, the interrupt line is shared so using level sensitive
interrupt is here especially important to avoid races.

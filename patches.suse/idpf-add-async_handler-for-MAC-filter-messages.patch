Subject: idpf: add async_handler for MAC filter messages
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
Git-commit: 41252855df77a9bef119489b66671e317efb5a7e
References: jsc#PED-11153

There are situations where the driver needs to add a MAC filter but
we're explicitly not allowed to sleep so we can wait for a virtchnl
message to complete.

This adds an async_handler for asynchronously sent messages for MAC
filters so that we can better handle if there's an error of some kind.
If success we don't need to do anything else, but if we failed to
program the new filter we really should remove it from our list of MAC
filters. If we don't remove bad filters, what I expect to happen is
after a reset of some kind we try to program the MAC filter again and it
fails again. This is clearly wrong and I would expect to be confusing
for the user.

It could also be the failure is for a delete MAC filter message but
those filters get deleted regardless. Not much we can do about a delete
failure.

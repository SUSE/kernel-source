Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: vgic-v4: Fall back to software irqbypass if LPI
 not found

Continuing with the theme of broken VMMs and guests, irqbypass
registration can fail if the virtual ITS lacks a translation for the
MSI. Either the guest hasn't mapped it or userspace may have forgotten
to restore the ITS.

Exit silently and allow irqbypass configuration to succeed. As a reward
for ingenuity, LPIs are demoted to software injection.

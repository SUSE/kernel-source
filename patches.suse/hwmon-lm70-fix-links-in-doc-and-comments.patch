Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (lm70) fix links in doc and comments
Git-commit: b18c01a4c82cf853add1255b51f7a4f1b3a39dc0
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

Update links in the documentation and in-code comments which point to
the datasheet.

The current links don't work because National Semiconductor (which is the
original manufacturer of this chip) has been a part of Texas Instruments
since 2011 and http://www.national.com/ doesn't work anymore.

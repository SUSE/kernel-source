Subject: [PATCH 11/15] riscv/kexec: refactor for kernel/Kconfig.kexec
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
Git-commit: 1f0d6efe52cfb85683f3e69a5c126769bbc31d86
References: jsc#PED-5077

The kexec and crash kernel options are provided in the common
kernel/Kconfig.kexec. Utilize the common options and provide
the ARCH_SUPPORTS_ and ARCH_SELECTS_ entries to recreate the
equivalent set of KEXEC and CRASH options.

-	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your

-	  but it is independent of the system firmware. And like a reboot
-	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.
 
-	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

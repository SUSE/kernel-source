Subject: [PATCH] mm: page_alloc: skip regions with hugetlbfs pages when
 allocating 1G pages

References: bsc#1210034
Patch-mainline: Submitted, April 2023 Linux-MM <linux-mm@kvack.org>

A bug was reported by Yuanxi Liu where allocating 1G pages at runtime is
taking an excessive amount of time for large amounts of memory.  Further
testing allocating huge pages that the cost is linear i.e.  if allocating
1G pages in batches of 10 then the time to allocate nr_hugepages from
10->20->30->etc increases linearly even though 10 pages are allocated at
each step.  Profiles indicated that much of the time is spent checking the
validity within already existing huge pages and then attempting a
migration that fails after isolating the range, draining pages and a whole
lot of other useless work.

Commit eb14d4eefdc4 ("mm,page_alloc: drop unnecessary checks from
pfn_range_valid_contig") removed two checks, one which ignored huge pages
for contiguous allocations as huge pages can sometimes migrate.  While
there may be value on migrating a 2M page to satisfy a 1G allocation, it's
potentially expensive if the 1G allocation fails and it's pointless to try
moving a 1G page for a new 1G allocation or scan the tail pages for valid
PFNs.

Reintroduce the PageHuge check and assume any contiguous region with
hugetlbfs pages is unsuitable for a new 1G allocation.

The hpagealloc test allocates huge pages in batches and reports the
average latency per page over time.  This test happens just after boot
when fragmentation is not an issue.  Units are in milliseconds.

The vanilla kernel is poor, taking up to 1.3 second to allocate a huge
page and almost 10 minutes in total to run the test.  Reverting the
problematic commit reduces it to 8ms at worst and the patch takes 26ms.
This patch fixes the main issue with skipping huge pages but leaves the
page_count() out because a page with an elevated count potentially can
migrate.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Update Panasonic CF-SZ6 quirk to support headset with microphone
Git-commit: 1576f263ee2147dc395531476881058609ad3d38
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc3
References: git-fixes

This patch addresses an issue with the Panasonic CF-SZ6's existing quirk,
specifically its headset microphone functionality. Previously, the quirk
used ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE, which does not support the CF-SZ6's design
of a single 3.5mm jack for both mic and audio output effectively. The
device uses pin 0x19 for the headset mic without jack detection.

Following verification on the CF-SZ6 and discussions with the original
patch author, i determined that the update to
ALC269_FIXUP_ASPIRE_HEADSET_MIC is the appropriate solution. This change
is custom-designed for the CF-SZ6's unique hardware setup, which includes
a single 3.5mm jack for both mic and audio output, connecting the headset
microphone to pin 0x19 without the use of jack detection.

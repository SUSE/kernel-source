Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ALSA: ump: Don't enumeration invalid groups for legacy rawmidi"
Git-commit: abbff41b6932cde359589fd51f4024b7c85f366b
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc6
References: stable-fixes

This reverts commit c2d188e137e77294323132a760a4608321a36a70.

Although it's fine to filter the invalid UMP groups at the first probe
time, this will become a problem when UMP groups are updated and
(re-)activated.  Then there is no way to re-add the substreams
properly for the legacy rawmidi, and the new active groups will be
still invisible.

So let's revert the change.  This will move back to showing the full
16 groups, but it's better than forever lost.

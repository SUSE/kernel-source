Subject: mptcp: add missing documented NL params
Git-commit: 6813b1928758ce64fabbb8ef157f994b7c2235fa
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc6
References: git-fixes

'loc_id' and 'rem_id' are set in all events linked to subflows but those
were missing in the events description in the comments.

Fixes: b911c97c7dc7 ("mptcp: add netlink event support")

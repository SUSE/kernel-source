Subject: [PATCH] HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in ishtp_hid_remove()
Git-commit: 07583a0010696a17fb0942e0b499a62785c5fc9f
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: git-fixes

The system can experience a random crash a few minutes after the driver is
removed. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory freeing in
the ishtp_hid_remove() function.

The function currently frees the `driver_data` directly within the loop
that destroys the HID devices, which can lead to accessing freed memory.
Specifically, `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls
`hid_ishtp_set_feature()` to power off the sensor, so freeing
`driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid memory.

This patch resolves the issue by storing the `driver_data` in a temporary
variable before calling `hid_destroy_device()`, and then freeing the
`driver_data` after the device is destroyed.

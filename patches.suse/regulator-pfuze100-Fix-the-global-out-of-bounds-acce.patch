Subject: [PATCH] regulator: pfuze100: Fix the global-out-of-bounds access in pfuze100_regulator_probe()
Git-commit: 78e1e867f44e6bdc72c0e6a2609a3407642fb30b
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc5
References: git-fixes

The pfuze_chip::regulator_descs is an array of size
PFUZE100_MAX_REGULATOR, the pfuze_chip::pfuze_regulators
is the pointer to the real regulators of a specific device.
The number of real regulator is supposed to be less than
the PFUZE100_MAX_REGULATOR, so we should use the size of
'regulator_num * sizeof(struct pfuze_regulator)' in memcpy().
This fixes the out of bounds access bug reported by KASAN.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath5k: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy
Git-commit: 24709752bfe8bc0147c9379a6ec8fe8d75874066
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect led->name to be NUL-terminated based on the presence of a
manual NUL-byte assignment.

This NUL-byte assignment was added in Commit daf9669bea30aa22 ("ath5k:
ensure led name is null terminated"). If strscpy() had existed and had
been used back when this code was written then potential bugs and the
need to manually NUL-terminate could have been avoided. Since we now
have the technology, let's use it :)

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding. If NUL-padding is required let's opt
for strscpy_pad().

Subject: [PATCH] i2c: cadence: cdns_i2c_master_xfer(): Fix runtime PM leak on error path
Git-commit: ae1664f04f504a998737f5bb563f16b44357bcca
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

The cdns_i2c_master_xfer() function gets a runtime PM reference when the
function is entered. This reference is released when the function is
exited. There is currently one error path where the function exits
directly, which leads to a leak of the runtime PM reference.

Make sure that this error path also releases the runtime PM reference.

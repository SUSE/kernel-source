Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: dmaengine: Correctly describe dmatest with channel unset
Git-commit: c61d7b2ef141abf81140756b45860a2306f395a2
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

Currently the documentation states that channels must be configured before
running the dmatest. This has not been true since commit 6b41030fdc79
("dmaengine: dmatest: Restore default for channel"). Fix accordingly.

 Allocating Channels

-Channels are required to be configured prior to starting the test run.
-Attempting to run the test without configuring the channels will fail.
+Channels do not need to be configured prior to starting a test run. Attempting
+to run the test without configuring the channels will result in testing any
+channels that are available.
 
 Example::
 
     % echo 1 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/run
-    dmatest: Could not start test, no channels configured
+    dmatest: No channels configured, continue with any
 
 Channels are registered using the "channel" parameter. Channels can be requested by their
 name, once requested, the channel is registered and a pending thread is added to the test list.

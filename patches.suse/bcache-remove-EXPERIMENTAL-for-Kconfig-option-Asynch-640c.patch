Subject: [PATCH] bcache: remove EXPERIMENTAL for Kconfig option 'Asynchronous
 device registration'
Git-commit: 640c46a21f89364f04445cdd43b61eb46bd49b5d
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

The "Asynchronous device registration (EXPERIMENTAL)" Kconfig option is
for 2+ years, it is used when registration takes too much time for
massive amount of cached data, to avoid udev task timeout during boot
time.

Many users and products enable this Kconfig option for quite long time
(e.g. SUSE Linux) and it works as expected and no issue reported.

It is time to remove the "EXPERIMENTAL" tag from this Kconfig item.

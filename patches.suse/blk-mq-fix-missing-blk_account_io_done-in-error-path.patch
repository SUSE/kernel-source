Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: fix missing blk_account_io_done() in error path
Git-commit: 592ee1197f78b30bd60c87db9b6c8c045c8d8314
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc2
References: jsc#PED-1183

If blk_mq_request_issue_directly() failed from
blk_insert_cloned_request(), the request will be accounted start.
Currently, blk_insert_cloned_request() is only called by dm, and such
request won't be accounted done by dm.

In normal path, io will be accounted start from blk_mq_bio_to_request(),
when the request is allocated, and such io will be accounted done from
__blk_mq_end_request_acct() whether it succeeded or failed. Thus add
blk_account_io_done() to fix the problem.

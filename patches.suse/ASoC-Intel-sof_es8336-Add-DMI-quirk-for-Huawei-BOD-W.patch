Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: Intel: sof_es8336: Add DMI quirk for Huawei BOD-WXX9
Git-commit: 6b641122d31f9d33e7d60047ee0586d1659f3f54
Patch-mainline: v6.19
References: stable-fixes

Add DMI entry for Huawei Matebook D (BOD-WXX9) with HEADPHONE_GPIO
and DMIC quirks.

This device has ES8336 codec with:
- GPIO 16 (headphone-enable) for headphone amplifier control
- GPIO 17 (speakers-enable) for speaker amplifier control
- GPIO 269 for jack detection IRQ
- 2-channel DMIC

Hardware investigation shows that both GPIO 16 and 17 are required
for proper audio routing, as headphones and speakers share the same
physical output (HPOL/HPOR) and are separated only via amplifier
enable signals.

Rfc: Seeking advice on GPIO control issue:

GPIO values change in driver (gpiod_get_value() shows logical value
changes) but not physically (debugfs gpio shows no change). The same
gpiod_set_value_cansleep() calls work correctly in probe context with
msleep(), but fail when called from DAPM event callbacks.

Context information from diagnostics:
- in_atomic=0, in_interrupt=0, irqs_disabled=0
- Process context: pipewire
- GPIO 17 (speakers): changes in driver, no physical change
- GPIO 16 (headphone): changes in driver, no physical change

In Windows, audio switching works without visible GPIO changes,
suggesting possible ACPI/firmware involvement.

Any suggestions on how to properly control these GPIOs from DAPM
events would be appreciated.

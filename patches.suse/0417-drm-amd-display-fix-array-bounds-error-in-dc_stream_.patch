Subject: drm/amd/display: fix array-bounds error in
 dc_stream_remove_writeback() [take 2]
Git-commit: faf4d8e07f5b67bece91723ad3e8b3f88a3dbf23
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1

Commit 5d8c3e836fc2 ("drm/amd/display: fix array-bounds error in
dc_stream_remove_writeback()") tried to fix an array bounds error seen
with gcc 12.0. Unfortunately, that results in another array bounds error,
seen with older versions of gcc.

We could check both i and j for overflow to fix the problem. That would,
however, be not make much sense since it is known and provable that j <= i.
Also, the check introduced with commit 5d8c3e836fc2 does not really add
value since it checks if j < MAX_DWB_PIPES. Since it is known that j <= i,
it would make more sense to check if i < MAX_DWB_PIPES. Unfortunately, that
does not help to solve the problem observed here: gcc still complains.

To solve the problem, replace the subsequent check for 'i != j' with
'j < i'. This is identical to the original check since we know that j <= i,
and it makes all versions of gcc happy. Drop the check introduced with
commit 5d8c3e836fc2 since it is not really useful and does not solve the
problem.

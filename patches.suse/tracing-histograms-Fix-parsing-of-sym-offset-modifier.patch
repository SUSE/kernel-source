Subject: tracing/histograms: Fix parsing of "sym-offset" modifier
Git-commit: 26c563731056c3ee66f91106c3078a8c36bb7a9e
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

With the addition of simple mathematical operations (plus and minus), the
parsing of the "sym-offset" modifier broke, as it took the '-' part of the
"sym-offset" as a minus, and tried to break it up into a mathematical
operation of "field.sym - offset", in which case it failed to parse
(unless the event had a field called "offset").

Both .sym and .sym-offset modifiers should not be entered into
mathematical calculations anyway. If ".sym-offset" is found in the
modifier, then simply make it not an operation that can be calculated on.

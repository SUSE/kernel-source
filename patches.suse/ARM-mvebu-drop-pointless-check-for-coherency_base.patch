Subject: ARM: mvebu: drop pointless check for coherency_base
Git-commit: 0b58725fb9a446890c1fd28fc6c9e393ce21acb7
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc2
References: git-fixes

The MMU off code path in ll_get_coherency_base() attempts to decide
whether the coherency fabric is mapped by testing the value of
coherency_base, which carries its virtual address if its mapped, and
0x0 otherwise.

However, what the code actually does is take the virtual address of
the coherency_base symbol, and compare it with 0x0, which are never
equal, and so the branch is never taken. In fact, with the MMU off,
dereferencing the VA of coherency_base is not possible to begin with,
nor can its value be relied upon with the MMU off since it is not
cleaned to the Dcache as is done with coherency_phys_base in
armada_370_coherency_init().

Instead, the value of coherency_phys_base is returned, which results
in the correct behavior since it will be 0x0 as well if the coherency
fabric is not mapped, and it is accessible with the MMU off. So just
drop the comparison and the branch.

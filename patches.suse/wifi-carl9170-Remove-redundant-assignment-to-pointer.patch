Subject: [PATCH] wifi: carl9170: Remove redundant assignment to pointer super
Git-commit: b53adefc884ce470a5b27885466439cbb087813e
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

The pointer super is being assigned a value that is not being read, it
is being re-assigned later. The assignment is redundant and can be
removed.

Cleans up clang scan warning:

drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:192:34: warning: Value stored to
'super' during its initialization is never read [deadcode.DeadStores]

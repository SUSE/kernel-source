Subject: [PATCH] xen: fix setting of max_pfn in shared_info

Xen PV guests are specifying the highest used PFN via the max_pfn
field in shared_info. This value is used by the Xen tools when saving
or migrating the guest.

Unfortunately this field is misnamed, as in reality it is specifying
the number of pages (including any memory holes) of the guest, so it
is the highest used PFN + 1. Renaming isn't possible, as this is a
public Xen hypervisor interface which needs to be kept stable.

The kernel will set the value correctly initially at boot time, but
when adding more pages (e.g. due to memory hotplug or ballooning) a
real PFN number is stored in max_pfn. This is done when expanding the
p2m array, and the PFN stored there is even possibly wrong, as it
should be the last possible PFN of the just added P2M frame, and not
one which led to the P2M expansion.

Fix that by setting shared_info->max_pfn to the last possible PFN + 1.

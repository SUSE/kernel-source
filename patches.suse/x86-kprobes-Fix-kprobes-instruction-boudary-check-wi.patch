Subject: x86/kprobes: Fix kprobes instruction boudary check with
 CONFIG_RETHUNK
Git-commit: 1993bf97992df2d560287f3c4120eda57426843d
Patch-mainline: 6.2-rc2
References: git-fixes

Since the CONFIG_RETHUNK and CONFIG_SLS will use INT3 for stopping
speculative execution after RET instruction, kprobes always failes to
check the probed instruction boundary by decoding the function body if
the probed address is after such sequence. (Note that some conditional
code blocks will be placed after function return, if compiler decides
it is not on the hot path.)

This is because kprobes expects kgdb puts the INT3 as a software
breakpoint and it will replace the original instruction.
But these INT3 are not such purpose, it doesn't need to recover the
original instruction.

To avoid this issue, kprobes checks whether the INT3 is owned by
kgdb or not, and if so, stop decoding and make it fail. The other
INT3 will come from CONFIG_RETHUNK/CONFIG_SLS and those can be
treated as a one-byte instruction.

Subject: [PATCH 05/17] net: lapbether: Remove netif_start_queue /
 netif_stop_queue
Git-commit: f7d9d4854519fdf4d45c70a4d953438cd88e7e58
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc3

For the devices in this driver, the default qdisc is "noqueue",
because their "tx_queue_len" is 0.

In function "__dev_queue_xmit" in "net/core/dev.c", devices with the
"noqueue" qdisc are specially handled. Packets are transmitted without
being queued after a "dev->flags & IFF_UP" check. However, it's possible
that even if this check succeeds, "ops->ndo_stop" may still have already
been called. This is because in "__dev_close_many", "ops->ndo_stop" is
called before clearing the "IFF_UP" flag.

If we call "netif_stop_queue" in "ops->ndo_stop", then it's possible in
"__dev_queue_xmit", it sees the "IFF_UP" flag is present, and then it
checks "netif_xmit_stopped" and finds that the queue is already stopped.
In this case, it will complain that:
"Virtual device ... asks to queue packet!"

To prevent "__dev_queue_xmit" from generating this complaint, we should
not call "netif_stop_queue" in "ops->ndo_stop".

We also don't need to call "netif_start_queue" in "ops->ndo_open",
because after a netdev is allocated and registered, the
"__QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF" flag is initially not set, so there is no need
to call "netif_start_queue" to clear it.

Subject: [PATCH] fs: cifs: Remove unnecessary struct declaration
Git-commit: d135be0a7fb83f4dd68721b3355fec6de686834c
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc7
References: bsc#1192606

struct cifs_readdata is declared twice. One is declared
at 208th line.
And struct cifs_readdata is defined blew.
The declaration here is not needed. Remove the duplicate.

Subject: ARM: dts: imx23-evk: Remove MX23_PAD_SSP1_DETECT from hog group
Git-commit: 42c9b28e6862d16db82a56f5667cf4d1f6658cf6
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc4
References: git-fixes

Currently, SD card fails to mount due to the following pinctrl error:

[   11.170000] imx23-pinctrl 80018000.pinctrl: pin SSP1_DETECT already requested by 80018000.pinctrl; cannot claim for 80010000.spi
[   11.180000] imx23-pinctrl 80018000.pinctrl: pin-65 (80010000.spi) status -22
[   11.190000] imx23-pinctrl 80018000.pinctrl: could not request pin 65 (SSP1_DETECT) from group mmc0-pins-fixup.0  on device 80018000.pinctrl
[   11.200000] mxs-mmc 80010000.spi: Error applying setting, reverse things back

Fix it by removing the MX23_PAD_SSP1_DETECT pin from the hog group as it
is already been used by the mmc0-pins-fixup pinctrl group.

With this change the rootfs can be mounted and the imx23-evk board can
boot successfully.

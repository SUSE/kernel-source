Subject: [PATCH] regulator: mt6315: Enforce regulator-compatible, not name

References: git-fixes

The MT6315 PMIC dt-binding should enforce that one of the valid
regulator-compatible is set in each regulator node. However it was
mistakenly matching against regulator-name instead.

Fix the typo. This not only fixes the compatible verification, but also
lifts the regulator-name restriction, so that more meaningful names can
be set for each platform.

Subject: [PATCH] fbdev: atyfb: only use ioremap_uc() on i386 and ia64
Git-commit: c1a8d1d0edb71dec15c9649cb56866c71c1ecd9e
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc7
References: git-fixes

ioremap_uc() is only meaningful on old x86-32 systems with the PAT
extension, and on ia64 with its slightly unconventional ioremap()
behavior, everywhere else this is the same as ioremap() anyway.

Change the only driver that still references ioremap_uc() to only do so
on x86-32/ia64 in order to allow removing that interface at some
point in the future for the other architectures.

On some architectures, ioremap_uc() just returns NULL, changing
the driver to call ioremap() means that they now have a chance
of working correctly.

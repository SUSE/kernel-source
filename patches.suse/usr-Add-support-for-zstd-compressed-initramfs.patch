Subject: usr: Add support for zstd compressed initramfs
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
Git-commit: a30d8a39f0571425a459816ed8680e987a2ff279
References: bsc#1187483

- Add support for a zstd compressed initramfs.

- Add compression for compressing built-in initramfs with zstd.

I have tested this patch by boot testing with buildroot and QEMU.
Specifically, I booted the kernel with both a zstd and gzip compressed
initramfs, both built into the kernel and separate. I ensured that the
correct compression algorithm was used. I tested on arm, aarch64, i386,
and x86_64.

This patch has been tested in production on aarch64 and x86_64 devices.

Additionally, I have performance measurements from internal use in
production. On an aarch64 device we saw 19 second boot time improvement
from switching from lzma to zstd (27 seconds to 8 seconds). On an x86_64
device we saw a 9 second boot time reduction from switching from xz to
zstd.

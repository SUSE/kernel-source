Subject: [PATCH] iio: ad5770r: make devicetree property reading consistent
Mime-version: 1.0

Git-commit: 26df977a909f818b7d346b3990735513e7e0bf93
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes stable-5.14.19

The bindings file for this driver is defining the property as 'reg' but
the driver was reading it with the 'num' name. The bindings actually had
the 'num' property when added in
commit ea52c21268e6 ("dt-bindings: iio: dac: Add docs for AD5770R DAC")
and then changed it to 'reg' in
commit 2cf3818f18b2 ("dt-bindings: iio: dac: AD5570R fix bindings errors").
However, both these commits landed in v5.7 so the assumption is
that either 'num' is not being used or if it is, the validations were not
done.

Anyways, if someone comes back yelling about this, we might just support
both of the properties in the future. Not ideal, but that's life...

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "usb: dwc3: core: Enable AutoRetry feature in the controller"
Git-commit: 734ae15ab95a18d3d425fc9cb38b7a627d786f08
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc4
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit b138e23d3dff90c0494925b4c1874227b81bddf7.

AutoRetry has been found to sometimes cause controller freezes when
communicating with buggy USB devices.

This controller feature allows the controller in host mode to send
non-terminating/burst retry ACKs instead of terminating retry ACKs
to devices when a transaction error (CRC error or overflow) occurs.

Unfortunately, if the USB device continues to respond with a CRC error,
the controller will not complete endpoint-related commands while it
keeps trying to auto-retry. [3] The xHCI driver will notice this once
it tries to abort the transfer using a Stop Endpoint command and
does not receive a completion in time. [1]
This situation is reported to dmesg:

[sda] tag#29 uas_eh_abort_handler 0 uas-tag 1 inflight: CMD IN
[sda] tag#29 CDB: opcode=0x28 28 00 00 69 42 80 00 00 48 00
Xhci-hcd: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
Xhci-hcd: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
Xhci-hcd: HC died; cleaning up

Some users observed this problem on an Odroid HC2 with the JMS578
USB3-to-SATA bridge. The issue can be triggered by starting
a read-heavy workload on an attached SSD. After a while, the host
controller would die and the SSD would disappear from the system. [1]

Further analysis by Synopsys determined that controller revisions
other than the one in Odroid HC2 are also affected by this.
The recommended solution was to disable AutoRetry altogether.
This change does not have a noticeable performance impact. [2]

Revert the enablement commit. This will keep the AutoRetry bit in
the default state configured during SoC design [2].

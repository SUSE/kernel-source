Subject: [PATCH] nvme-tcp: rerun io_work if req_list is not empty
Git-commit: a0fdd1418007f83565d3f2e04b47923ba93a9b8c
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

A possible race condition exists where the request to send data is
enqueued from nvme_tcp_handle_r2t()'s will not be observed by
nvme_tcp_send_all() if it happens to be running. The driver relies on
io_work to send the enqueued request when it is runs again, but the
concurrently running nvme_tcp_send_all() may not have released the
send_mutex at that time. If no future commands are enqueued to re-kick
the io_work, the request will timeout in the SEND_H2C state, resulting
in a timeout error like:

  nvme nvme0: queue 1: timeout request 0x3 type 6

Ensure the io_work continues to run as long as the req_list is not empty.

The FEC does not have a PHY so it should not have a phy-handle. It is
connected to the switch at RGMII level so we need a fixed-link sub-node
on both ends.

This was not a problem until the qca8k.c driver was converted to PHYLINK
by commit b3591c2a3661 ("net: dsa: qca8k: Switch to PHYLINK instead of
PHYLIB"). That commit revealed the FEC configuration was not correct.

Fixes: 87489ec3a77f ("ARM: dts: imx: Add Y Soft IOTA Draco, Hydra and Ursa boards")

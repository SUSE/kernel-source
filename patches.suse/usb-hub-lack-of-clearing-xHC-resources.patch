Subject: [PATCH] usb: hub: lack of clearing xHC resources
Git-commit: 2b66ef84d0d2a0ea955b40bd306f5e3abbc5cf9c
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: git-fixes

The xHC resources allocated for USB devices are not released in correct
order after resuming in case when while suspend device was reconnected.

This issue has been detected during the fallowing scenario:
- connect hub HS to root port
- connect LS/FS device to hub port
- wait for enumeration to finish
- force host to suspend
- reconnect hub attached to root port
- wake host

For this scenario during enumeration of USB LS/FS device the Cadence xHC
reports completion error code for xHC commands because the xHC resources
used for devices has not been properly released.
XHCI specification doesn't mention that device can be reset in any order
so, we should not treat this issue as Cadence xHC controller bug.
Similar as during disconnecting in this case the device resources should
be cleared starting form the last usb device in tree toward the root hub.
To fix this issue usbcore driver should call hcd->driver->reset_device
for all USB devices connected to hub which was reconnected while
suspending.

Subject: KVM: TDX: ADD pages to the TD image while populating mirror EPT
 entries
Git-commit: 6b5b71ffabf9b0eb250ae6d4e0ab7fbac622f0f0
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

When populating the initial memory image for a TDX guest, ADD pages to the
TD as part of establishing the mappings in the mirror EPT, as opposed to
creating the mappings and then doing ADD after the fact.  Doing ADD in the
S-EPT callbacks eliminates the need to track "premapped" pages, as the
mirror EPT (M-EPT) and S-EPT are always synchronized, e.g. if ADD fails,
KVM reverts to the previous M-EPT entry (guaranteed to be !PRESENT).

Eliminating the hole where the M-EPT can have a mapping that doesn't exist
in the S-EPT in turn obviates the need to handle errors that are unique to
encountering a missing S-EPT entry (see tdx_is_sept_zap_err_due_to_premap()).

Keeping the M-EPT and S-EPT synchronized also eliminates the need to check
for unconsumed "premap" entries during tdx_td_finalize(), as there simply
can't be any such entries.  Dropping that check in particular reduces the
overall cognitive load, as the management of nr_premapped with respect
to removal of S-EPT is _very_ subtle.  E.g. successful removal of an S-EPT
entry after it completed ADD doesn't adjust nr_premapped, but it's not
clear why that's "ok" but having half-baked entries is not (it's not truly
"ok" in that removing pages from the image will likely prevent the guest
from booting, but from KVM's perspective it's "ok").

Doing ADD in the S-EPT path requires passing an argument via a scratch
field, but the current approach of tracking the number of "premapped"
pages effectively does the same.  And the "premapped" counter is much more
dangerous, as it doesn't have a singular lock to protect its usage, since
nr_premapped can be modified as soon as mmu_lock is dropped, at least in
theory.  I.e. nr_premapped is guarded by slots_lock, but only for "happy"
paths.

Note, this approach was used/tried at various points in TDX development,
but was ultimately discarded due to a desire to avoid stashing temporary
state in kvm_tdx.  But as above, KVM ended up with such state anyways,
and fully committing to using temporary state provides better access
rules (100% guarded by slots_lock), and makes several edge cases flat out
impossible.

Note #2, continue to extend the measurement outside of mmu_lock, as it's
a slow operation (typically 16 SEAMCALLs per page whose data is included
in the measurement), and doesn't *need* to be done under mmu_lock, e.g.
for consistency purposes.  However, MR.EXTEND isn't _that_ slow, e.g.
~1ms latency to measure a full page, so if it needs to be done under
mmu_lock in the future, e.g. because KVM gains a flow that can remove
S-EPT entries during KVM_TDX_INIT_MEM_REGION, then extending the
measurement can also be moved into the S-EPT mapping path (again, only if
absolutely necessary).  P.S. _If_ MR.EXTEND is moved into the S-EPT path,
take care not to return an error up the stack if TDH_MR_EXTEND fails, as
removing the M-EPT entry but not the S-EPT entry would result in
inconsistent state!

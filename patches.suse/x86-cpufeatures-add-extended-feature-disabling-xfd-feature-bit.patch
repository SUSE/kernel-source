Subject: x86/cpufeatures: Add eXtended Feature Disabling (XFD) feature bit
Git-commit: c351101678ce54492b6e09810ec02efc0df036a9
Patch-mainline: v5.15 or v5.15-rc8 (next release)
References: jsc#SLE-18931

Intel's eXtended Feature Disable (XFD) feature is an extension of the XSAVE
architecture. XFD allows the kernel to enable a feature state in XCR0 and
to receive a #NM trap when a task uses instructions accessing that state.

This is going to be used to postpone the allocation of a larger XSTATE
buffer for a task to the point where it is actually using a related
instruction after the permission to use that facility has been granted.

XFD is not used by the kernel, but only applied to userspace. This is a
matter of policy as the kernel knows how a fpstate is reallocated and the
XFD state.

The compacted XSAVE format is adjustable for dynamic features. Make XFD
depend on XSAVES.

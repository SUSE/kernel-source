Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: don't drop extent_map for free space inode on write
 error
Git-commit: 5571e41ec6e56e35f34ae9f5b3a335ef510e0ade
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc5
References: CVE-2024-26726 bsc#1222532

While running the CI for an unrelated change I hit the following panic
with generic/648 on btrfs_holes_spacecache.

assertion failed: block_start != EXTENT_MAP_HOLE, in fs/btrfs/extent_io.c:1385

This happens because we fail to write out the free space cache in one
instance, come back around and attempt to write it again.  However on
the second pass through we go to call btrfs_get_extent() on the inode to
get the extent mapping.  Because this is a new block group, and with the
free space inode we always search the commit root to avoid deadlocking
with the tree, we find nothing and return a EXTENT_MAP_HOLE for the
requested range.

This happens because the first time we try to write the space cache out
we hit an error, and on an error we drop the extent mapping.  This is
normal for normal files, but the free space cache inode is special.  We
always expect the extent map to be correct.  Thus the second time
through we end up with a bogus extent map.

Since we're deprecating this feature, the most straightforward way to
fix this is to simply skip dropping the extent map range for this failed
range.

I shortened the test by using error injection to stress the area to make
it easier to reproduce.  With this patch in place we no longer panic
with my error injection test.

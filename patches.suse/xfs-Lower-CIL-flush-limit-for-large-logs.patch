Subject: [PATCH] xfs: Lower CIL flush limit for large logs
Git-commit: 108a42358a05312b2128533c6462a3fdeb410bdf
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

The current CIL size aggregation limit is 1/8th the log size. This
means for large logs we might be aggregating at least 250MB of dirty objects
in memory before the CIL is flushed to the journal. With CIL shadow
buffers sitting around, this means the CIL is often consuming >500MB
of temporary memory that is all allocated under GFP_NOFS conditions.

Flushing the CIL can take some time to do if there is other IO
ongoing, and can introduce substantial log force latency by itself.
It also pins the memory until the objects are in the AIL and can be
written back and reclaimed by shrinkers. Hence this threshold also
tends to determine the minimum amount of memory XFS can operate in
under heavy modification without triggering the OOM killer.

Modify the CIL space limit to prevent such huge amounts of pinned
metadata from aggregating. We can have 2MB of log IO in flight at
once, so limit aggregation to 16x this size. This threshold was
chosen as it little impact on performance (on 16-way fsmark) or log
traffic but pins a lot less memory on large logs especially under
heavy memory pressure.  An aggregation limit of 8x had 5-10%
performance degradation and a 50% increase in log throughput for
the same workload, so clearly that was too small for highly
concurrent workloads on large logs.

This was found via trace analysis of AIL behaviour. e.g. insertion
from a single CIL flush:

Xfs_ail_insert: old lsn 0/0 new lsn 1/3033090 type XFS_LI_INODE flags IN_AIL

$ grep xfs_ail_insert /mnt/scratch/s.t |grep "new lsn 1/3033090" |wc -l
1721823
$

So there were 1.7 million objects inserted into the AIL from this
CIL checkpoint, the first at 2323.392108, the last at 2325.667566 which
was the end of the trace (i.e. it hadn't finished). Clearly a major
problem.

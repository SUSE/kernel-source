Subject: [PATCH] block: ataflop: fix breakage introduced at blk-mq refactoring
Git-commit: 86d46fdaa12ae5befc16b8d73fc85a3ca0399ea6
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: stable-5.14.19

[ Upstream commit 86d46fdaa12ae5befc16b8d73fc85a3ca0399ea6 ]

Refactoring of the Atari floppy driver when converting to blk-mq
has broken the state machine in not-so-subtle ways:

finish_fdc() must be called when operations on the floppy device
have completed. This is crucial in order to relase the ST-DMA
lock, which protects against concurrent access to the ST-DMA
controller by other drivers (some DMA related, most just related
to device register access - broken beyond compare, I know).

When rewriting the driver's old do_request() function, the fact
that finish_fdc() was called only when all queued requests had
completed appears to have been overlooked. Instead, the new
request function calls finish_fdc() immediately after the last
request has been queued. finish_fdc() executes a dummy seek after
most requests, and this overwrites the state machine's interrupt
hander that was set up to wait for completion of the read/write
request just prior. To make matters worse, finish_fdc() is called
before device interrupts are re-enabled, making certain that the
read/write interupt is missed.

Shifting the finish_fdc() call into the read/write request
completion handler ensures the driver waits for the request to
actually complete. With a queue depth of 2, we won't see long
request sequences, so calling finish_fdc() unconditionally just
adds a little overhead for the dummy seeks, and keeps the code
simple.

While we're at it, kill ataflop_commit_rqs() which does nothing
but run finish_fdc() unconditionally, again likely wiping out an
in-flight request.

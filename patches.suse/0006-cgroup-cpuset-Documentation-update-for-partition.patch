Subject: cgroup/cpuset: Documentation update for partition
Git-commit: efdf7532bd3d302a96436beee153364f26a1ddae
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-11934

This patch updates the cgroup-v2.rst file to include information about
the new "cpuset.cpus.exclusive" and "cpuset.cpus.excluisve.effective"
control files as well as the new remote partition type.

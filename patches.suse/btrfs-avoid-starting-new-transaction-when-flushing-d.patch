Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: avoid starting new transaction when flushing delayed
 items and refs

When flushing space we join a transaction to flush delayed items and
delayed references, in order to try to release space. However using
btrfs_join_transaction() not only joins an existing transaction as well
as it starts a new transaction if there is none open. If there is no
transaction open, we don't have neither delayed items nor delayed
references, so creating a new transaction is a waste of time, IO and
creates an unnecessary rotation of the backup roots without gaining any
benefits (including releasing space).

So use btrfs_join_transaction_nostart() when attempting to flush delayed
items and references.

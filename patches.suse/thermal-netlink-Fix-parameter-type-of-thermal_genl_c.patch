Subject: thermal: netlink: Fix parameter type of
 thermal_genl_cpu_capability_event() stub
Git-commit: 345be4275cad454ae7e25884369a9c6c25e56279
Patch-mainline: 5.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-820

When building with CONFIG_THERMAL_NETLINK=n, there is a spew of warnings
along the lines of:

  In file included from drivers/thermal/thermal_core.c:27:
  In file included from drivers/thermal/thermal_core.h:15:
  drivers/thermal/thermal_netlink.h:113:71: warning: declaration of 'struct cpu_capability' will not be visible outside of this function [-Wvisibility]
  static inline int thermal_genl_cpu_capability_event(int count, struct cpu_capability *caps)
                                                                        ^
  1 warning generated.

'struct cpu_capability' is not forward declared anywhere in the header.
As it turns out, this should really be 'struct thermal_genl_cpu_caps',
which silences the warning and makes the parameter types of the stub
match the full function.

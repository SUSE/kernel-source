Subject: zram: refuse to use zero sized block device as backing device
Git-commit: be48c412f6ebf38849213c19547bc6d5b692b5e5
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc4
References: git-fixes

Patch series "zram: fix backing device setup issue", v2.

This series fixes two bugs of backing device setting:

- ZRAM should reject using a zero sized (or the uninitialized ZRAM
  device itself) as the backing device.
- Fix backing device leaking when removing a uninitialized ZRAM
  device.


This patch (of 2):

Setting a zero sized block device as backing device is pointless, and one
can easily create a recursive loop by setting the uninitialized ZRAM
device itself as its own backing device by (zram0 is uninitialized):

    echo /dev/zram0 > /sys/block/zram0/backing_dev

It's definitely a wrong config, and the module will pin itself, kernel
should refuse doing so in the first place.

By refusing to use zero sized device we avoided misuse cases including
this one above.

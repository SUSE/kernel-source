Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge/panel: Fix runtime warning on panel bridge release
Git-commit: ce62600c4dbee8d43b02277669dd91785a9b81d9
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc4
References: git-fixes

Device managed panel bridge wrappers are created by calling to
drm_panel_bridge_add_typed() and registering a release handler for
clean-up when the device gets unbound.

Since the memory for this bridge is also managed and linked to the panel
device, the release function should not try to free that memory.
Moreover, the call to devm_kfree() inside drm_panel_bridge_remove() will
fail in this case and emit a warning because the panel bridge resource
is no longer on the device resources list (it has been removed from
there before the call to release handlers).

Fixes: 67022227ffb1 ("drm/bridge: Add a devm_ allocator for panel bridge.")

Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: address off-by-one in xhci_num_trbs_free()
Git-commit: 5adc1cc038f4446b11dd260e0a848fdeaac12306
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1

Reduce the number of do-while loops by 1. The number of loops should be
number of segment + 1, the +1 is in case deq and enq are on the same
segment. But due to the use of a do-while loop, the expression is
evaluated after executing the loop, thus the loop is executed 1 extra
time.

Changing the do-while loop expression from "<=" to "<", reduces the loop
amount by 1. The expression "<=" would also work if it was a while loop
instead of a do-while loop.

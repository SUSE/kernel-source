Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: realtek: Fix rtl8211f_config_init() for RTL8211F(D)(I)-VD-CG PHY
Git-commit: 3489182b11d35f1944c1245fc9c4867cf622c50f
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc6
References: git-fixes

Commit bb726b753f75 ("net: phy: realtek: add support for
RTL8211F(D)(I)-VD-CG") extended support of the driver from the existing
support for RTL8211F(D)(I)-CG PHY to the newer RTL8211F(D)(I)-VD-CG PHY.

While that commit indicated that the RTL8211F_PHYCR2 register is not
supported by the "VD-CG" PHY model and therefore updated the corresponding
section in rtl8211f_config_init() to be invoked conditionally, the call to
"genphy_soft_reset()" was left as-is, when it should have also been invoked
conditionally. This is because the call to "genphy_soft_reset()" was first
introduced by the commit 0a4355c2b7f8 ("net: phy: realtek: add dt property
to disable CLKOUT clock") since the RTL8211F guide indicates that a PHY
reset should be issued after setting bits in the PHYCR2 register.

As the PHYCR2 register is not applicable to the "VD-CG" PHY model, fix the
rtl8211f_config_init() function by invoking "genphy_soft_reset()"
conditionally based on the presence of the "PHYCR2" register.

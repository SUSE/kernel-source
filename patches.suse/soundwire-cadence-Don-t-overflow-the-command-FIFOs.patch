Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: cadence: Don't overflow the command FIFOs
Git-commit: 7cbfee2e2e40d2be54196362a845a3ea0a3f877d
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

The command FIFOs in the Cadence IP can be configured during design
up to 32 entries, and the code in cadence_master.c was assuming the
full 32-entry FIFO. But all current Intel implementations use an 8-entry
FIFO.

Up to now the longest message used was 6 entries so this wasn't
causing any problem. But future Cirrus Logic codecs have downloadable
firmware or tuning blobs. It is more efficient for the codec driver to
issue long transfers that can take advantage of any queuing in the
Soundwire controller and avoid the overhead of repeatedly writing the
page registers.

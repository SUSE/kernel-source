Subject: [PATCH] i2c: imx: when being a target, mark the last read as processed
Git-commit: 87aec499368d488c20292952d6d4be7cb9e49c5e
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc6
References: git-fixes

When being a target, NAK from the controller means that all bytes have
been transferred. So, the last byte needs also to be marked as
'processed'. Otherwise index registers of backends may not increase.

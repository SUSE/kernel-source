Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: qgroup: remove outdated TODO comments
Git-commit: 457b0a3d6e266f40a367205e224b971e4da7f5f8
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: bsc#1207158

These comments are old, outdated and not very specific. It seems that it
doesn't help to inspire anybody to work on that.  So we remove them.

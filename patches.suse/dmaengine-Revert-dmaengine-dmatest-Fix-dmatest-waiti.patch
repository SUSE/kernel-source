Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: Revert "dmaengine: dmatest: Fix dmatest waiting less when interrupted"
Git-commit: df180e65305f8c1e020d54bfc2132349fd693de1
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc7
References: git-fixes

Several issues with this change:

* The analysis is flawed and it's unclear what problem is being
  fixed. There is no difference between wait_event_freezable_timeout()
  and wait_event_timeout() with respect to device interrupts. And of
  course "the interrupt notifying the finish of an operation happens
  during wait_event_freezable_timeout()" -- that's how it's supposed
  to work.

* The link at the "Closes:" tag appears to be an unrelated
  use-after-free in idxd.

* It introduces a regression: dmatest threads are meant to be
  freezable and this change breaks that.

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix off-by-one error in do_split
Git-commit: 94824ac9a8aaf2fb3c54b4bdde842db80ffa555d
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc2
References: CVE-2025-23150 bsc#1242513

Syzkaller detected a use-after-free issue in ext4_insert_dentry that was
caused by out-of-bounds access due to incorrect splitting in do_split.

The following loop is located right above 'if' statement.

for (i = count-1; i >= 0; i--) {
	/* is more than half of this entry in 2nd half of the block? */
	if (size + map[i].size/2 > blocksize/2)
		break;
	size += map[i].size;
	move++;
}

'i' in this case could go down to -1, in which case sum of active entries
wouldn't exceed half the block size, but previous behaviour would also do
split in half if sum would exceed at the very last block, which in case of
having too many long name files in a single block could lead to
out-of-bounds access and following use-after-free.

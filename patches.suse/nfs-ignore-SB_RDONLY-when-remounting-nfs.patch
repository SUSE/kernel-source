Subject: [PATCH] nfs: ignore SB_RDONLY when remounting nfs
Patch-mainline: not yet, https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250304130533.549840-1-lilingfeng3@huawei.com/
References: bsc#1238565

In some scenarios, when mounting NFS, more than one superblock may be
created. The final superblock used is the last one created, but only the
first superblock carries the ro flag passed from user space. If a ro flag
is added to the superblock via remount, it will trigger the issue
described in Link[1].

Link[2] attempted to address this by marking the superblock as ro during
the initial mount. However, this introduced a new problem in scenarios
where multiple mount points share the same superblock:
[root@a ~]# mount /dev/sdb /mnt/sdb
[root@a ~]# echo "/mnt/sdb *(rw,no_root_squash)" > /etc/exports
[root@a ~]# echo "/mnt/sdb/test_dir2 *(ro,no_root_squash)" >> /etc/exports
[root@a ~]# systemctl restart nfs-server
[root@a ~]# mount -t nfs -o rw 127.0.0.1:/mnt/sdb/test_dir1 /mnt/test_mp1
[root@a ~]# mount | grep nfs4
127.0.0.1:/mnt/sdb/test_dir1 on /mnt/test_mp1 type nfs4 (rw,relatime,...
[root@a ~]# mount -t nfs -o ro 127.0.0.1:/mnt/sdb/test_dir2 /mnt/test_mp2
[root@a ~]# mount | grep nfs4
127.0.0.1:/mnt/sdb/test_dir1 on /mnt/test_mp1 type nfs4 (ro,relatime,...
127.0.0.1:/mnt/sdb/test_dir2 on /mnt/test_mp2 type nfs4 (ro,relatime,...
[root@a ~]#

When mounting the second NFS, the shared superblock is marked as ro,
causing the previous NFS mount to become read-only.

To resolve both issues, the ro flag is no longer applied to the superblock
during remount. Instead, the ro flag on the mount is used to control
whether the mount point is read-only.

Subject: net/smc: Fix dependency of SMC on ISM
Git-commit: a72178cfe855c283224f393d94a1332b90d1483e
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc6
References: jsc#PED-10299

When the SMC protocol is built into the kernel proper while ISM is
configured to be built as module, linking the kernel fails due to
unresolved dependencies out of net/smc/smc_ism.o to
ism_get_smcd_ops, ism_register_client, and ism_unregister_client
as reported via the linux-next test automation (see link).
This however is a bug introduced a while ago.

Correct the dependency list in ISM's and SMC's Kconfig to reflect the
dependencies that are actually inverted. With this you cannot build a
kernel with CONFIG_SMC=y and CONFIG_ISM=m. Either ISM needs to be 'y',
too - or a 'n'. That way, SMC can still be configured on non-s390
architectures that do not have (nor need) an ISM driver.

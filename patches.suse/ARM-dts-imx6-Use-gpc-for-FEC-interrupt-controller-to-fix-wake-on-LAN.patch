Subject: ARM: dts: imx6: Use gpc for FEC interrupt controller to fix wake on
 LAN.
Git-commit: 4141f1a40fc0789f6fd4330e171e1edf155426aa
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc2
References: git-fixes

In order to wake from suspend by ethernet magic packets the GPC
must be used as intc does not have wakeup functionality.

But the FEC DT node currently uses interrupt-extended,
specificying intc, thus breaking WoL.

This problem is probably fallout from the stacked domain conversion
as intc used to chain to GPC.

So replace "interrupts-extended" by "interrupts" to use the default
parent which is GPC.

Fixes: b923ff6af0d5 ("ARM: imx6: convert GPC to stacked domains")

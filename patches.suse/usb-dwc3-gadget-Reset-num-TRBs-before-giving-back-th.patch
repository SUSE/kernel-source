Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Reset num TRBs before giving back the request
Git-commit: 00f8205ffcf112dcef14f8151d78075d38d22c08
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc7
References: git-fixes

Consider a scenario where cable disconnect happens when there is an active
usb reqest queued to the UDC. As part of the disconnect we would issue an
end transfer with no interrupt-on-completion before giving back this
request. Since we are giving back the request without skipping TRBs the
num_trbs field of dwc3_request still holds the stale value previously used.
Function drivers re-use same request for a given bind-unbind session and
hence their dwc3_request context gets preserved across cable
disconnect/connect. When such a request gets re-queued after cable connect,
we would increase the num_trbs field on top of the previous stale value
thus incorrectly representing the number of TRBs used. Fix this by
resetting num_trbs field before giving back the request.

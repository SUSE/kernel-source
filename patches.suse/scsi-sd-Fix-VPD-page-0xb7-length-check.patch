Subject: scsi: sd: Fix VPD page 0xb7 length check
Git-commit: 8889676cd62161896f1d861ce294adc29c4f2cb5
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc5
References: git-fixes

sd_read_block_limits_ext() currently assumes that vpd->len excludes the
size of the page header. However, vpd->len describes the size of the entire
VPD page, therefore the sanity check is incorrect.

In practice this is not really a problem since we don't attach VPD
pages unless they actually report data trailing the header. But fix
the length check regardless.

This issue was identified by Wukong-Agent (formerly Tencent Woodpecker), a
code security AI agent, through static code analysis.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: it6505: Drop EDID cache on bridge power off
Git-commit: 574c558ddb68591c9a4b7a95e45e935ab22c0fc6
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

The bridge might miss the display change events when it's powered off.
This happens when a user changes the external monitor when the system
is suspended and the embedded controller doesn't not wake AP up.

It's also observed that one DP-to-HDMI bridge doesn't work correctly
when there is no EDID read after it is powered on.

Drop the cache to force an EDID read after system resume to fix this.

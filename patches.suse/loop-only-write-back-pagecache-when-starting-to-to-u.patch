Subject: [PATCH] loop: only write back pagecache when starting to to use
 direct I/O
Git-commit: 09ccf5549d7809671af34774bb30c8f935d6ed2b
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9651

There is no point in doing an fdatasync to write out pages when switching
away from direct I/O, as there won't be any.  The writeback is only
needed when switching to direct I/O, which would have to invalidate the
pagecache less efficiently from the I/O path.

Subject: [PATCH] seccomp: Fix a race with WAIT_KILLABLE_RECV if the tracer replies too fast
Git-commit: cce436aafc2abad691fdd37de63ec8a4490b42ce
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Normally the tracee starts in SECCOMP_NOTIFY_INIT, sends an
event to the tracer, and starts to wait interruptibly. With
SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_WAIT_KILLABLE_RECV, if the tracer receives the
message (SECCOMP_NOTIFY_SENT is reached) while the tracee was waiting
and is subsequently interrupted, the tracee begins to wait again
uninterruptibly (but killable).

This fails if SECCOMP_NOTIFY_REPLIED is reached before the tracee
is interrupted, as the check only considered SECCOMP_NOTIFY_SENT as a
condition to begin waiting again. In this case the tracee is interrupted
even though the tracer already acted on its behalf. This breaks the
assumption SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_WAIT_KILLABLE_RECV wanted to ensure,
namely that the tracer can be sure the syscall is not interrupted or
restarted on the tracee after it is received on the tracer. Fix this
by also considering SECCOMP_NOTIFY_REPLIED when evaluating whether to
switch to uninterruptible waiting.

With the condition changed the loop in seccomp_do_user_notification()
would exit immediately after deciding that noninterruptible waiting
is required if the operation already reached SECCOMP_NOTIFY_REPLIED,
skipping the code that processes pending addfd commands first. Prevent
this by executing the remaining loop body one last time in this case.

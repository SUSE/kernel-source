Subject: net/mlx5: Reclaim max 50K pages at once

References: jsc#PED-9900 jsc#PED-11429

In non FLR context, at times CX-5 requests release of ~8 million FW pages.
This needs humongous number of cmd mailboxes, which to be released once
the pages are reclaimed. Release of humongous number of cmd mailboxes is
consuming cpu time running into many seconds. Which with non preemptible
kernels is leading to critical process starving on that cpuâ€™s RQ.
On top of it, the FW does not use all the mailbox messages as it has a
limit of releasing 50K pages at once per MLX5_CMD_OP_MANAGE_PAGES +
MLX5_PAGES_TAKE device command. Hence, the allocation of these many
mailboxes is extra and adds unnecessary overhead.
To alleviate this, this change restricts the total number of pages
a worker will try to reclaim to maximum 50K pages in one go.

Our tests have shown significant benefit of this change in terms of
time consumed by dma_pool_free().
During a test where an event was raised by HCA
to release 1.3 Million pages, following observations were made:

- Without this change:
Number of mailbox messages allocated was around 20K, to accommodate
the DMA addresses of 1.3 million pages.
The average time spent by dma_pool_free() to free the DMA pool is between
16 usec to 32 usec.

- With this change:
Number of mailbox messages allocated was around 800; this was to
accommodate DMA addresses of only 50K pages.
The average time spent by dma_pool_free() to free the DMA pool in this case
lies between 1 usec to 2 usec.

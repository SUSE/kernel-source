Subject: [PATCH] printk: nbcon: Remove return value for write_atomic()

References: bsc#1214683 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Git-commit: b7049d88c1763d5f133b0e93e39da8e89a9f944b
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1

The return value of write_atomic() does not provide any useful
information. On the contrary, it makes things more complicated
for the caller to appropriately deal with the information.

Change write_atomic() to not have a return value. If the
message did not get printed due to loss of ownership, the
caller will notice this on its own. If ownership was not lost,
it will be assumed that the driver successfully printed the
message and the sequence number for that console will be
incremented.

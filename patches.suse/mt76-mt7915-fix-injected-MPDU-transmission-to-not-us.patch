Subject: [PATCH] mt76: mt7915: fix injected MPDU transmission to not use HW A-MSDU
Git-commit: 28225a6ef80ebf46c46e5fbd5b1ee231a0b2b5b7
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Before, the hardware would be allowed to transmit injected 802.11 MPDUs
as A-MSDU. This resulted in corrupted frames being transmitted. Now,
injected MPDUs are transmitted as-is, without A-MSDU.

The fix was verified with frame injection on MT7915 hardware, both with
and without the injected frame being encrypted.

If the hardware cannot do A-MSDU aggregation on MPDUs, this problem
would also be present in the TX path where mac80211 does the 802.11
encapsulation. However, I have not observed any such problem when
disabling IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_TX_ENCAP_OFFLOAD to force that mode.
Therefore this fix is isolated to injected frames only.

The same A-MSDU logic is also present in the mt7921 driver, so it is
likely that this fix should be applied there too. I do not have access
to mt7921 hardware so I have not been able to test that.

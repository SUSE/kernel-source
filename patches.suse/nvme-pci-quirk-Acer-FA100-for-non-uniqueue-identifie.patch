Subject: nvme-pci: quirk Acer FA100 for non-uniqueue identifiers
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc4
Git-commit: fcd875445866a5219cf2be3101e276b21fc843f3
References: git-fixes

In order for two Acer FA100 SSDs to work in one PC (in the case of
myself, a Lenovo Legion T5 28IMB05), and not show one drive and not
the other, and sometimes mix up what drive shows up (randomly), these
two lines of code need to be added, and then both of the SSDs will
show up and not conflict when booting off of one of them. If you boot
up your computer with both SSDs installed without this patch, you may
also randomly get into a kernel panic (if the initrd is not set up) or
stuck in the initrd "/init" process, it is set up, however, if you do
apply this patch, there should not be problems with booting or seeing
both contents of the drive. Tested with the btrfs filesystem with a
RAID configuration of having the root drive '/' combined to make two
256GB Acer FA100 SSDs become 512GB in total storage.

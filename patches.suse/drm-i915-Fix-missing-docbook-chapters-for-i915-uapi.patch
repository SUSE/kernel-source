Subject: drm/i915: Fix missing docbook chapters for i915 uapi.
Git-commit: 1cbf731ef3a17b3dd4c22ed0c634ac126d1a4876
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

I noticed when grepping for DOC: that those were defined
in the header, but not actually used. Fix it by removing
all chapters and the internal annotation, so the docbook
generated chapters are used.

This reverts the changes to driver-uapi.rst by the referenced commit
577729533cdc ("drm/i915: Document the Virtual Engine uAPI")

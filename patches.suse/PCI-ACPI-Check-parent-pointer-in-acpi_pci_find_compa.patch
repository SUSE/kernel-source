Subject: [PATCH] PCI: ACPI: Check parent pointer in acpi_pci_find_companion()
Git-commit: 3fb937f441c64af1eec60bfd3732f64001fcc534
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc5

If acpi_pci_find_companion() is called for a device whose parent
pointer is NULL, it will crash when attempting to get the ACPI
companion of the parent due to a NULL pointer dereference in
the ACPI_COMPANION() macro.

This was not a problem before commit 375553a93201 ("PCI: Setup ACPI
fwnode early and at the same time with OF") that made pci_setup_device()
call pci_set_acpi_fwnode() and so it allowed devices with NULL parent
pointers to be passed to acpi_pci_find_companion() which is the case
in pci_iov_add_virtfn(), for instance.

Fix this issue by making acpi_pci_find_companion() check the device's
parent pointer upfront and bail out if it is NULL.

While pci_iov_add_virtfn() can be changed to set the device's parent
pointer before calling pci_setup_device() for it, checking pointers
against NULL before dereferencing them is prudent anyway and looking
for ACPI companions of virtual functions isn't really useful.

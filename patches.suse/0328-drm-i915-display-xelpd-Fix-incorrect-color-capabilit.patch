Subject: drm/i915/display/xelpd: Fix incorrect color capability reporting
Git-commit: edc2c4b9566872d30c14706b881345c131fb8b6b
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-22601

On XELPD platforms, color management support is not yet enabled.
Fix wrongly reporting the same through platform info, which was
resulting in incorrect initialization and usage.

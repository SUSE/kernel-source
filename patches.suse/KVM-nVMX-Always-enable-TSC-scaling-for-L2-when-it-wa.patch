Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Always enable TSC scaling for L2 when it was
 enabled for L1

Windows 10/11 guests with Hyper-V role (WSL2) enabled are observed to
hang upon boot or shortly after when a non-default TSC frequency was
set for L1. The issue is observed on a host where TSC scaling is
supported. The problem appears to be that Windows doesn't use TSC
scaling for its guests, even when the feature is advertised, and KVM
filters SECONDARY_EXEC_TSC_SCALING out when creating L2 controls from
L1's VMCS. This leads to L2 running with the default frequency (matching
host's) while L1 is running with an altered one.

Keep SECONDARY_EXEC_TSC_SCALING in secondary exec controls for L2 when
it was set for L1. TSC_MULTIPLIER is already correctly computed and
written by prepare_vmcs02().

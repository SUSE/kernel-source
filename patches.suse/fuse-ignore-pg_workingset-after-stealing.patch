Subject: fuse: ignore PG_workingset after stealing
Git-commit: b89ecd60d38ec042d63bdb376c722a16f92bcb88
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: bsc#1188268

Fix the "fuse: trying to steal weird page" warning.

Description from Johannes Weiner:

  "Think of it as similar to PG_active. It's just another usage/heat
   indicator of file and anon pages on the reclaim LRU that, unlike
   PG_active, persists across deactivation and even reclaim (we store it in
   the page cache / swapper cache tree until the page refaults).

   So if fuse accepts pages that can legally have PG_active set,
   PG_workingset is fine too."

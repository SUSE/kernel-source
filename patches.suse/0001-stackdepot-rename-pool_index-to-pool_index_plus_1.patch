Subject: [PATCH] stackdepot: rename pool_index to pool_index_plus_1
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc3
Git-commit: a6c1d9cb9a68bfa4512248419c4f4d880d19fe90

Commit 3ee34eabac2a ("lib/stackdepot: fix first entry having a 0-handle")
changed the meaning of the pool_index field to mean "the pool index plus
1".  This made the code accessing this field less self-documenting, as
well as causing debuggers such as drgn to not be able to easily remain
compatible with both old and new kernels, because they typically do that
by testing for presence of the new field.  Because stackdepot is a
debugging tool, we should make sure that it is debugger friendly.
Therefore, give the field a different name to improve readability as well
as enabling debugger backwards compatibility.

This is needed in 6.9, which would otherwise become an odd release with
the new semantics and old name so debuggers wouldn't recognize the new
semantics there.

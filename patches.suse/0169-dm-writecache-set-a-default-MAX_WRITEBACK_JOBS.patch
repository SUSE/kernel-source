Subject: [PATCH] dm writecache: set a default MAX_WRITEBACK_JOBS
Git-commit: ca7dc242e358e46d963b32f9d9dd829785a9e957
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-2765

dm-writecache has the capability to limit the number of writeback jobs
in progress. However, this feature was off by default. As such there
were some out-of-memory crashes observed when lowering the low
watermark while the cache is full.

This commit enables writeback limit by default. It is set to 256MiB or
1/16 of total system memory, whichever is smaller.

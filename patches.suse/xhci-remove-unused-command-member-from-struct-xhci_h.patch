Subject: [PATCH] xhci: remove unused command member from struct xhci_hcd
 struct
Git-commit: 1a855a83592ed968d95ea28f15755c22f8336fba
References: jsc#PED-531
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1

The u32 command was added to struct xhci_hcd over 10 years ago in
commit 9777e3ce907d ("USB: xHCI: bus power management implementation")

It wasn't even used back then, so remove it.

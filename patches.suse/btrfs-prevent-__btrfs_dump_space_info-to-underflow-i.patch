Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: prevent __btrfs_dump_space_info() to underflow its free space
Git-commit: 0619b7901473c380abc05d45cf9c70bee0707db3
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc3
References: stable-5.14.9

commit 0619b7901473c380abc05d45cf9c70bee0707db3 upstream.

It's not uncommon where __btrfs_dump_space_info() gets called
under over-commit situations.

In that case free space would underflow as total allocated space is not
enough to handle all the over-committed space.

Such underflow values can sometimes cause confusion for users enabled
enospc_debug mount option, and takes some seconds for developers to
convert the underflow value to signed result.

Just output the free space as s64 to avoid such problem.

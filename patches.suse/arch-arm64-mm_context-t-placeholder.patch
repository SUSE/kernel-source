Subject: arch/arm64: Add a kABI placeholder for the future TLBI boradcast fixes
Patch-mainline: Never, kABI placeholder
References: bsc#1183030

This patch adds a kABI placeholder in mm_context_t for arm64 arch
so that we'll be able to backport the TLBI broadcast fixes later on.
The field is currently not used.

Subject: [PATCH] usbnet: ipheth: drop RX URBs with no payload
Git-commit: 94d7eeb6c0ef0310992944f0d0296929816a2cb0
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc4

On iPhone 15 Pro Max one can observe periodic URBs with no payload
on the "bulk in" (RX) endpoint. These don't seem to do anything
meaningful. Reproduced on iOS 17.5.1 and 17.6.

This behaviour isn't observed on iPhone 11 on the same iOS version. The
nature of these zero-length URBs is so far unknown.

Drop RX URBs with no payload.

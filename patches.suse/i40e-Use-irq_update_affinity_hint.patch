Subject: i40e: Use irq_update_affinity_hint()
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: d34c54d1739c2cdf2e4437b74e6da269147f4987
References: jsc#PED-372

The driver uses irq_set_affinity_hint() for two purposes:

 - To set the affinity_hint which is consumed by the userspace for
   distributing the interrupts

 - To apply an affinity that it provides for the i40e interrupts

The latter is done to ensure that all the interrupts are evenly spread
across all available CPUs. However, since commit a0c9259dc4e1 ("irq/matrix:
Spread interrupts on allocation") the spreading of interrupts is
dynamically performed at the time of allocation. Hence, there is no need
for the drivers to enforce their own affinity for the spreading of
interrupts.

Also, irq_set_affinity_hint() applying the provided cpumask as an affinity
for the interrupt is an undocumented side effect. To remove this side
effect irq_set_affinity_hint() has been marked as deprecated and new
interfaces have been introduced. Hence, replace the irq_set_affinity_hint()
with the new interface irq_update_affinity_hint() that only sets the
pointer for the affinity_hint.

Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

In the fb_defio video driver, page dirty state is used to determine when
frame buffer pages have been changed, allowing for batched, deferred I/O
to be performed for efficiency.

This implementation had only one means of doing so effectively - the use
of the folio_mkclean() function.

However, this use of the function is inappropriate, as the fb_defio
implementation allocates kernel memory to back the framebuffer, and then
is forced to specified page->index, mapping fields in order to permit the
folio_mkclean() rmap traversal to proceed correctly.

It is not correct to specify these fields on kernel-allocated memory, and
moreover since these are not folios, page->index, mapping are deprecated
fields, soon to be removed.

We therefore need to provide a means by which we can correctly traverse
the reverse mapping and write-protect mappings for a page backing an
address_space page cache object at a given offset.

This patch provides this - mapping_wrprotect_range() - which allows for
this operation to be performed for a specified address_space, offset, PFN
and size, without requiring a folio nor, of course, an inappropriate use
of page->index, mapping.

With this provided, we can subsequently adjust the fb_defio implementation
to make use of this function and avoid incorrect invocation of
folio_mkclean() and more importantly, incorrect manipulation of
page->index and mapping fields.

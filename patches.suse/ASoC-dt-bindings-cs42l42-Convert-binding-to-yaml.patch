Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dt-bindings: cs42l42: Convert binding to yaml
Git-commit: 0f9710603e803ae9b64ed3b54019170b323968d7
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsc#1203699

Replace the old .txt binding with a new schema binding.
At the same time, some of the descriptions are updated to make them
clearer, fix errors, or just make them fit better into the style
of schema binding.

The cirrus,hs-bias-ramp-rate property was missing from the old .txt
binding and has been added to the yaml.

+description:
+  The CS42L42 is a low-power audio codec designed for portable applications.
+  It provides a high-dynamic range, stereo DAC for audio playback and a mono
+  high-dynamic-range ADC for audio capture. There is an integrated headset
+  detection block.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath12k: indicate to mac80211 scan complete with aborted flag for ATH12K_SCAN_STARTING state
Git-commit: c2ebb1d11ab95cdb56529182a9673ed05c33e7fd
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

Scan failure can not be recovered from when running a loop of the
following steps:
1. run scan: "iw wlan scan".
2. run command: echo assert > /sys/kernel/debug/ath12k/wcn7850\ hw2.0/simulate_fw_crash
   immediately after step 1.

Result: 
scan failed and can not recover even when wlan recovery succeeds:
command failed: Device or resource busy (-16)

Reason: 
When scan arrives, WMI_START_SCAN_CMDID is sent to the firmware and
function ath12k_mac_op_hw_scan() returns, then simulate_fw_crash arrives
and the scan started event does not arrive, and then it starts to do
recovery of wlan. __ath12k_mac_scan_finish() which is called from
ath12k_core_halt() is one step of recovery, it will not call
ieee80211_scan_completed() by logic currently because the scan state is
ATH12K_SCAN_STARTING. Thus it leads the scan not being completed in
mac80211, and leads all consecutive scans failing with -EBUSY in
nl80211_trigger_scan even after wlan recovery success.

Indicate scan complete with aborted flag to mac80211 for
ATH12K_SCAN_STARTING to allow recovery from scan failed with "Device or
resource busy (-16)" after wlan recovery.

Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0-03427-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-1.15378.4

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: wl18xx: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy
Git-commit: fb329e8b1d88dd09b6f46d7ba3d9243599221b68
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

wl->chip.phy_fw_ver_str is obviously intended to be NUL-terminated by
the deliberate comment telling us as much. Furthermore, its only use is
drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/debugfs.c shows us it should be
NUL-terminated since its used in scnprintf:
492 | DRIVER_STATE_PRINT_STR(chip.phy_fw_ver_str);
which is defined as:
| #define DRIVER_STATE_PRINT_STR(x)  DRIVER_STATE_PRINT(x, "%s")
...
| #define DRIVER_STATE_PRINT(x, fmt)   \
| 	(res += scnprintf(buf + res, DRIVER_STATE_BUF_LEN - res,\
| 			  #x " = " fmt "\n", wl->x))

We can also see that NUL-padding is not required.

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

The very fact that a plain-english comment had to be made alongside a
manual NUL-byte assignment for such a simple purpose shows why strncpy
is faulty. It has non-obvious behavior that has to be clarified every
time it is used (and if it isn't then the reader suffers).

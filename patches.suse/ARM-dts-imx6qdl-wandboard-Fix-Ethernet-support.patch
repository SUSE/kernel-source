References: git-fixes

Currently, the imx6q-wandboard Ethernet does not transmit any
data.

This issue has been exposed by commit f5d9aa79dfdf ("ARM: imx6q:
remove clk-out fixup for the Atheros AR8031 and AR8035 PHYs").

Fix it by describing the qca,clk-out-frequency property as suggested
by the commit above.

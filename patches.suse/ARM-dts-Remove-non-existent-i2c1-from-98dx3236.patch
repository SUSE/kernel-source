Subject: ARM: dts: Remove non-existent i2c1 from 98dx3236
Git-commit: 7f24479ead579459106bb55c2320a000135731f9
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

The switches with integrated CPUs have only got a single i2c controller.
They incorrectly gained one when they were split from the Armada-XP.

Fixes: 43e28ba87708 ("ARM: dts: Use armada-370-xp as a base for armada-xp-98dx3236")

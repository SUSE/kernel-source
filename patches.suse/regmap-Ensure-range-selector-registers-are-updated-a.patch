Subject: [PATCH] regmap: Ensure range selector registers are updated after cache sync
Git-commit: 0ec7731655de196bc1e4af99e495b38778109d22
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

When we sync the register cache we do so with the cache bypassed in order
to avoid overhead from writing the synced values back into the cache. If
the regmap has ranges and the selector register for those ranges is in a
register which is cached this has the unfortunate side effect of meaning
that the physical and cached copies of the selector register can be out of
sync after a cache sync. The cache will have whatever the selector was when
the sync started and the hardware will have the selector for the register
that was synced last.

Fix this by rewriting all cached selector registers after every sync,
ensuring that the hardware and cache have the same content. This will
result in extra writes that wouldn't otherwise be needed but is simple
so hopefully robust. We don't read from the hardware since not all
devices have physical read support.

Given that nobody noticed this until now it is likely that we are rarely if
ever hitting this case.

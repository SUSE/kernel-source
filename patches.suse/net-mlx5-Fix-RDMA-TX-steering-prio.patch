Subject: net/mlx5: Fix RDMA TX steering prio
Patch-mainline: v6.13
Git-commit: c08d3e62b2e73e14da318a1d20b52d0486a28ee0
References: git-fixes

User added steering rules at RDMA_TX were being added to the first prio,
which is the counters prio.
Fix that so that they are correctly added to the BYPASS_PRIO instead.

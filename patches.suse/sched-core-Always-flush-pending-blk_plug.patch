Subject: [PATCH] sched/core: Always flush pending blk_plug

References: bnc#1189999 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)

With CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT, it is possible to hit a deadlock between two
normal priority tasks (SCHED_OTHER, nice level zero):

Here the kworker is waiting on msdos_sb_info::s_lock which is held by
tar which is in turn waiting for a buffer which is locked waiting to be
flushed, but this operation is plugged in the kworker.

The lock is a normal struct mutex, so tsk_is_pi_blocked() will always
return false on !RT and thus the behaviour changes for RT.

It seems that the intent here is to skip blk_flush_plug() in the case
where a non-preemptible lock (such as a spinlock) has been converted to
a rtmutex on RT, which is the case covered by the SM_RTLOCK_WAIT
schedule flag.  But sched_submit_work() is only called from schedule()
which is never called in this scenario, so the check can simply be
deleted.

Looking at the history of the -rt patchset, in fact this change was
present from v5.9.1-rt20 until being dropped in v5.13-rt1 as it was part
of a larger patch [1] most of which was replaced by commit b4bfa3fcfe3b
("sched/core: Rework the __schedule() preempt argument").

As described in [1]:

   The schedule process must distinguish between blocking on a regular
   sleeping lock (rwsem and mutex) and a RT-only sleeping lock (spinlock
   and rwlock):
   - rwsem and mutex must flush block requests (blk_schedule_flush_plug())
     even if blocked on a lock. This can not deadlock because this also
     happens for non-RT.
     There should be a warning if the scheduling point is within a RCU read
     section.

   - spinlock and rwlock must not flush block requests. This will deadlock
     if the callback attempts to acquire a lock which is already acquired.
     Similarly to being preempted, there should be no warning if the
     scheduling point is within a RCU read section.

and with the tsk_is_pi_blocked() in the scheduler path, we hit the first
issue.

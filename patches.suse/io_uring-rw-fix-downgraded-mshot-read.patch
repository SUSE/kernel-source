Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/rw: fix downgraded mshot read
Git-commit: 38fc96a58ce40257aec79b32e9b310c86907c63c
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc6
References: git-fixes

The io-wq path can downgrade a multishot request to oneshot mode,
however io_read_mshot() doesn't handle that and would still post
multiple CQEs. That's not allowed, because io_req_post_cqe() requires
stricter context requirements.

The described can only happen with pollable files that don't support
FMODE_NOWAIT, which is an odd combination, so if even allowed it should
be fairly rare.

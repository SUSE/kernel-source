Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: improve error message after failure to add delayed dir index item

If we fail to add a delayed dir index item because there's already another
item with the same index number, we print an error message (and then BUG).
However that message isn't very helpful to debug anything because we don't
know what's the index number and what are the values of index counters in
the inode and its delayed inode (index_cnt fields of struct btrfs_inode
and struct btrfs_delayed_node).

So update the error message to include the index number and counters.

We actually had a recent case where this issue was hit by a syzbot report
(see the link below).

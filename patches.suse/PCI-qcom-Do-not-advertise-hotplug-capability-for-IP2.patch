Subject: [PATCH] PCI: qcom: Do not advertise hotplug capability for IPs v2.3.3
 and v2.9.0
Git-commit: 11bce06b21a0d5f002156b2bc6573329f285a927
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1

SoCs making use of Qcom PCIe controller IPs v2.3.3 and v2.9.0 do not
support hotplug functionality. But the hotplug capability bit is set by
default in the hardware. This causes the kernel PCI core to register
hotplug service for the controller and send hotplug commands to it. But
those commands will timeout generating messages as below during boot
and suspend/resume.

[    5.782159] pcieport 0001:00:00.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x03c0 (issued 2020 msec ago)
[    5.810161] pcieport 0001:00:00.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x03c0 (issued 2048 msec ago)
[    7.838162] pcieport 0001:00:00.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x07c0 (issued 2020 msec ago)
[    7.870159] pcieport 0001:00:00.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x07c0 (issued 2052 msec ago)

This not only spams the console output but also induces a delay of a
couple of seconds. To fix this issue, let's not set the HPC bit in
PCI_EXP_SLTCAP register as a part of the post init sequence to not
advertise the hotplug capability for the controller.

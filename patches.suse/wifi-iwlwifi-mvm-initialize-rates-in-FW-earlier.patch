Subject: [PATCH] wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: initialize rates in FW earlier
Git-commit: d3b2c6c65bfd3b9616084e91bd0d402964ea7cef
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

When connecting to an AP, we currently initialize the rate
control only after associating. Since we now use firmware
to assign rates to auth/assoc frames rather than using the
data in the station and the firmware doesn't know, they're
transmitted using low mandatory rates. However, if the AP
advertised only higher supported rates we want to use them
to be nicer (it still must receive mandatory rates though),
so send the information to the firmware earlier to have it
know about it and be able to use it.

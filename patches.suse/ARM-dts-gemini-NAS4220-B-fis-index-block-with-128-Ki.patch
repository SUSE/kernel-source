Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: gemini: NAS4220-B: fis-index-block with 128 KiB sectors
Git-commit: 4754eab7e5a78bdefe7a960c5c260c95ebbb5fa6
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

Steven Maddox reported in the OpenWrt bugzilla, that his
RaidSonic IB-NAS4220-B was no longer booting with the new
OpenWrt 21.02 (uses linux 5.10's device-tree). However, it was
working with the previous OpenWrt 19.07 series (uses 4.14).

|[    5.548038] No RedBoot partition table detected in 30000000.flash
|[    5.618553] Searching for RedBoot partition table in 30000000.flash at offset 0x0
|[    5.739093] No RedBoot partition table detected in 30000000.flash
|...
|[    7.039504] Waiting for root device /dev/mtdblock3...

The provided bootlog shows that the RedBoot partition parser was
looking for the partition table "at offset 0x0". Which is strange
since the comment in the device-tree says it should be at 0xfe0000.

Further digging on the internet led to a review site that took
some useful PCB pictures of their review unit back in February 2009.
Their picture shows a Spansion S29GL128N11TFI01 flash chip.

>From Spansion's Datasheet:
"s29gl128n: One hundred twenty-eight 64 Kword (128 Kbyte) sectors"
Steven also provided a "cat /sys/class/mtd/mtd0/erasesize" from his
Unit: "131072".

With the 128 KiB Sector/Erasesize in mind. This patch changes the
fis-index-block property to (0xfe0000 / 0x20000) = 0x7f.

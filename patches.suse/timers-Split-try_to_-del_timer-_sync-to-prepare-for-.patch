Subject: timers: Split [try_to_]del_timer[_sync]() to prepare for shutdown
 mode
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
Git-commit: 8553b5f2774a66b1f293b7d783934210afb8f23c
References: bsc#1213970

Tearing down timers which have circular dependencies to other
functionality, e.g. workqueues, where the timer can schedule work and work
can arm timers, is not trivial.

In those cases it is desired to shutdown the timer in a way which prevents
rearming of the timer. The mechanism to do so is to set timer->function to
NULL and use this as an indicator for the timer arming functions to ignore
the (re)arm request.

Split the inner workings of try_do_del_timer_sync(), del_timer_sync() and
del_timer() into helper functions to prepare for implementing the shutdown
functionality.

No functional change.

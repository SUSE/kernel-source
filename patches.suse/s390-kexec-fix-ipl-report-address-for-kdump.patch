Subject: [PATCH] s390/kexec: fix ipl report address for kdump
References: bsc#1207529
Git-commit: c2337a40e04dde1692b5b0a46ecc59f89aaba8a1
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc4

This commit addresses the following erroneous situation with file-based
kdump executed on a system with a valid IPL report.

On s390, a kdump kernel, its initrd and IPL report if present are loaded
into a special and reserved on boot memory region - crashkernel. When
a system crashes and kdump was activated before, the purgatory code
is entered first which swaps the crashkernel and [0 - crashkernel size]
memory regions. Only after that the kdump kernel is entered. For this
reason, the pointer to an IPL report in lowcore must point to the IPL report
after the swap and not to the address of the IPL report that was located in
crashkernel memory region before the swap. Failing to do so, makes the
kdump's decompressor try to read memory from the crashkernel memory region
which already contains the production's kernel memory.

The situation described above caused spontaneous kdump failures/hangs
on systems where the Secure IPL is activated because on such systems
an IPL report is always present. In that case kdump's decompressor tried
to parse an IPL report which frequently lead to illegal memory accesses
because an IPL report contains addresses to various data.

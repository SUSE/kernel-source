Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: Fix deadlocks with kctl removals at disconnection
Git-commit: 87988a534d8e12f2e6fc01fe63e6c1925dc5307c
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: stable-fixes CVE-2024-38600 bsc#1226864

In snd_card_disconnect(), we set card->shutdown flag at the beginning,
call callbacks and do sync for card->power_ref_sleep waiters at the
end.  The callback may delete a kctl element, and this can lead to a
deadlock when the device was in the suspended state.  Namely:

* A process waits for the power up at snd_power_ref_and_wait() in
  snd_ctl_info() or read/write() inside card->controls_rwsem.

* The system gets disconnected meanwhile, and the driver tries to
  delete a kctl via snd_ctl_remove*(); it tries to take
  card->controls_rwsem again, but this is already locked by the
  above.  Since the sleeper isn't woken up, this deadlocks.

An easy fix is to wake up sleepers before processing the driver
disconnect callbacks but right after setting the card->shutdown flag.
Then all sleepers will abort immediately, and the code flows again.

So, basically this patch moves the wait_event() call at the right
timing.  While we're at it, just to be sure, call wait_event_all()
instead of wait_event(), although we don't use exclusive events on
this queue for now.

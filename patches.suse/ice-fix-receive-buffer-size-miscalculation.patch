Subject: ice: fix receive buffer size miscalculation
Patch-mainline: v6.5
Git-commit: 10083aef784031fa9f06c19a1b182e6fad5338d9
References: git-fixes

The driver is misconfiguring the hardware for some values of MTU such that
it could use multiple descriptors to receive a packet when it could have
simply used one.

Change the driver to use a round-up instead of the result of a shift, as
the shift can truncate the lower bits of the size, and result in the
problem noted above. It also aligns this driver with similar code in i40e.

The insidiousness of this problem is that everything works with the wrong
size, it's just not working as well as it could, as some MTU sizes end up
using two or more descriptors, and there is no way to tell that is
happening without looking at ice_trace or a bus analyzer.

Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: Apply initial command workaround for more Intel chips
Date: Thu,  2 Dec 2021 17:22:56 +0100
Message-id: <20211202162256.31837-1-tiwai@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, linux-bluetooth ML
References: bsc#1193124

It seems that a few more Intel chips require the workaround for the
broken initial command.  At least, per openSUSE Bugzilla reports,
8087:0a2a needs BTUSB_INTEL_BROKEN_INITIAL_NCMD flag.

[ Note: in the v1 patch, there was an entry for 8087:0026, but this
  seems false-positive, and causing another issue, thus it was
  dropped in this version ]

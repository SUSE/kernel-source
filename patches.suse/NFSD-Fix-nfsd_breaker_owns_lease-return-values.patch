Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: Fix nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() return values
Git-commit: 50719bf3442dd6cd05159e9c98d020b3919ce978
Patch-mainline: v5.18
References: git-fixes

These have been incorrect since the function was introduced.

A proper kerneldoc comment is added since this function, though
static, is part of an external interface.

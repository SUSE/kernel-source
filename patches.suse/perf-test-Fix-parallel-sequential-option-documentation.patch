Subject: perf test: Fix parallel/sequential option documentation
Git-commit: 4dd8bc4bf58e973eea3fdf5e2013011d83fba6c4
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: git-fixes 
X-Info: perf-sle16-v6.13-userspace-update

The parallel option was removed in commit 94d1a913bdc4 ("perf test:
Make parallel testing the default"). Update the sequential
documentation to reflect it isn't the default except for "exclusive"
tests.

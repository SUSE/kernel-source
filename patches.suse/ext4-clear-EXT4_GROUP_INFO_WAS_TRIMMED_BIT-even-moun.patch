Subject: [PATCH] ext4: clear EXT4_GROUP_INFO_WAS_TRIMMED_BIT even mount with
 discard
Git-commit: 20cee68f5b44fdc2942d20f3172a262ec247b117
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: bsc#1234190

Commit 3d56b8d2c74c ("ext4: Speed up FITRIM by recording flags in
ext4_group_info") speed up fstrim by skipping trim trimmed group. We
also has the chance to clear trimmed once there exists some block free
for this group(mount without discard), and the next trim for this group
will work well too.

For mount with discard, we will issue dicard when we free blocks, so
leave trimmed flag keep alive to skip useless trim trigger from
userspace seems reasonable. But for some case like ext4 build on
dm-thinpool(ext4 blocksize 4K, pool blocksize 128K), discard from ext4
maybe unaligned for dm thinpool, and thinpool will just finish this
discard(see process_discard_bio when begein equals to end) without
actually process discard. For this case, trim from userspace can really
help us to free some thinpool block.

So convert to clear trimmed flag for all case no matter mounted with
discard or not.

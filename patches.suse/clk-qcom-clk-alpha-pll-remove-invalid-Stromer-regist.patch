Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: clk-alpha-pll: remove invalid Stromer register offset
Git-commit: 4f2bc4acbb1916b8cd2ce4bb3ba7b1cd7cb705fa
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

The offset of the CONFIG_CTL_U register defined for the Stromer
PLL is wrong. It is not aligned on a 4 bytes boundary which might
causes errors in regmap operations.

Maybe the intention behind of using the 0xff value was to indicate
that the register is not implemented in the PLL, but this is not
verified anywhere in the code. Moreover, this value is not used
even in other register offset arrays despite that those PLLs also
have unimplemented registers.

Additionally, on the Stromer PLLs the current code only touches
the CONFIG_CTL_U register if the result of pll_has_64bit_config()
is true which condition is not affected by the change.

Due to the reasons above, simply remove the CONFIG_CTL_U entry
from the Stromer specific array.

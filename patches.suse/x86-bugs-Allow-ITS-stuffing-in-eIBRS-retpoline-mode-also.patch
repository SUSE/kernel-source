Subject: x86/bugs: Allow ITS stuffing in eIBRS+retpoline mode also
Git-commit: ab9f2388e0b99cd164ddbd74a6133d3070e2788d
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

After a recent restructuring of the ITS mitigation, RSB stuffing can no longer
be enabled in eIBRS+Retpoline mode. Before ITS, retbleed mitigation only
allowed stuffing when eIBRS was not enabled. This was perfectly fine since
eIBRS mitigates retbleed.

However, RSB stuffing mitigation for ITS is still needed with eIBRS. The
restructuring solely relies on retbleed to deploy stuffing, and does not allow
it when eIBRS is enabled. This behavior is different from what was before the
restructuring. Fix it by allowing stuffing in eIBRS+retpoline mode also.

Subject: perf/x86/amd/core: Define a proper ref-cycles event for Zen 4 and
 later
Git-commit: 68cdf1e6e8f2ce78ed7d8f5d80844fd75a9c54ff
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc2
References: jsc#PED-11561

Add the "ref-cycles" event for AMD processors based on Zen 4 and later
microarchitectures. The backing event is based on PMCx120 which counts
cycles not in halt state in P0 frequency (same as MPERF).

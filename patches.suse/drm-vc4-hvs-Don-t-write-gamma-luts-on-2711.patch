Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: hvs: Don't write gamma luts on 2711
Git-commit: 52efe364d1968ee3e3ed45eb44eb924b63635315
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

The gamma block has changed in 2711, therefore writing the lut
in vc4_hvs_lut_load is incorrect.

Whilst the gamma property isn't created for 2711, it is called
from vc4_hvs_init_channel, so abort if attempted.

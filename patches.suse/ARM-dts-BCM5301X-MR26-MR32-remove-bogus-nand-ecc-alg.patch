| bcm53016-meraki-mr32.dtb: nand-controller@18028000:

original ECC values for these old Merakis are sadly not
provided by the vendor. It looks like Meraki just stuck
with what Broadcom's SDK was doing... which left this
up to the proprietary nand driver.

Note: The invalid setting was and is handled by brcmnand. It
falls back to "bch" in brcmnand_setup_dev() when ecc.algo is
set to NAND_ECC_ALGO_UNKNOWN (since "hw" is not in the list
above).

A correct nand-ecc-algo = "bch"; is already specified in the
included  "bcm5301x-nand-cs0-bch8.dtsi". So this line can be
dropped.

Subject: [PATCH] USB: cdc-acm: fix break reporting
Git-commit: 58fc1daa4d2e9789b9ffc880907c961ea7c062cc
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc5
References: git-fixes stable-5.14.12

A recent change that started reporting break events forgot to push the
event to the line discipline, which meant that a detected break would
not be reported until further characters had been receive (the port
could even have been closed and reopened in between).

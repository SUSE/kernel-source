Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: Avoid lockdep reports when resolving supplies
Git-commit: cba6cfdc7c3f1516f0d08ddfb24e689af0932573
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

An automated bot told me that there was a potential lockdep problem
with regulators. This was on the chromeos-5.15 kernel, but I see
nothing that would be different downstream compared to upstream. The
bot said:
  ============================================

The problem was first reported soon after we made many of the
regulators probe asynchronously, though nothing I've seen implies that
the problems couldn't have also happened even without that.

I haven't personally been able to reproduce the lockdep issue, but the
issue does look somewhat legitimate. Specifically, it looks like in
regulator_resolve_supply() we are holding a "rdev" lock while calling
set_supply() -> create_regulator() which grabs the lock of a
_different_ "rdev" (the one for our supply). This is not necessarily
safe from a lockdep perspective since there is no documented ordering
between these two locks.

In reality, we should always be locking a regulator before the
supplying regulator, so I don't expect there to be any real deadlocks
in practice. However, the regulator framework in general doesn't
express this to lockdep.

Let's fix the issue by simply grabbing the two locks involved in the
same way we grab multiple locks elsewhere in the regulator framework:
using the "wound/wait" mechanisms.

Subject: KVM: s390: pv: don't present the ecall interrupt twice
Git-commit: c3f0e5fd2d33d80c5a5a8b5e5d2bab2841709cc8
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: bsc#1203229 LTC#199905

When the SIGP interpretation facility is present and a VCPU sends an
ecall to another VCPU in enabled wait, the sending VCPU receives a 56
intercept (partial execution), so KVM can wake up the receiving CPU.
Note that the SIGP interpretation facility will take care of the
interrupt delivery and KVM's only job is to wake the receiving VCPU.

For PV, the sending VCPU will receive a 108 intercept (pv notify) and
should continue like in the non-PV case, i.e. wake the receiving VCPU.

For PV and non-PV guests the interrupt delivery will occur through the
SIGP interpretation facility on SIE entry when SIE finds the X bit in
the status field set.

However, in handle_pv_notification(), there was no special handling for
SIGP, which leads to interrupt injection being requested by KVM for the
next SIE entry. This results in the interrupt being delivered twice:
once by the SIGP interpretation facility and once by KVM through the
IICTL.

Add the necessary special handling in handle_pv_notification(), similar
to handle_partial_execution(), which simply wakes the receiving VCPU and
leave interrupt delivery to the SIGP interpretation facility.

In contrast to external calls, emergency calls are not interpreted but
also cause a 108 intercept, which is why we still need to call
handle_instruction() for SIGP orders other than ecall.

Since kvm_s390_handle_sigp_pei() is now called for all SIGP orders which
cause a 108 intercept - even if they are actually handled by
handle_instruction() - move the tracepoint in kvm_s390_handle_sigp_pei()
to avoid possibly confusing trace messages.

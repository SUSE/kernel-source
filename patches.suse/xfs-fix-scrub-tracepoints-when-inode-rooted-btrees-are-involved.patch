Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix scrub tracepoints when inode-rooted btrees are
 involved
Git-commit: ffc3ea4f3c1cc83a86b7497b0c4b0aee7de5480d
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

Fix a minor mistakes in the scrub tracepoints that can manifest when
inode-rooted btrees are enabled.  The existing code worked fine for bmap
btrees, but we should tighten the code up to be less sloppy.

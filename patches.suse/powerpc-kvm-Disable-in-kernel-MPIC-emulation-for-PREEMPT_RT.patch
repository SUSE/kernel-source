Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/kvm: Disable in-kernel MPIC emulation for PREEMPT_RT

References: SLE Realtime Extension
Git-commit: 6c6239dcc29d8f334cd9e99e2ba153a76fe0af77
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository (v6.5-rc4-rt1)
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel.git/

While converting the openpic emulation code to use a raw_spinlock_t enables
guests to run on RT, there's still a performance issue. For interrupts sent in
directed delivery mode with a multiple CPU mask, the emulated openpic will loop
through all of the VCPUs, and for each VCPUs, it call IRQ_check, which will loop
through all the pending interrupts for that VCPU. This is done while holding the
raw_lock, meaning that in all this time the interrupts and preemption are
disabled on the host Linux. A malicious user app can max both these number and
cause a DoS.

This temporary fix is sent for two reasons. First is so that users who want to
use the in-kernel MPIC emulation are aware of the potential latencies, thus
making sure that the hardware MPIC and their usage scenario does not involve
interrupts sent in directed delivery mode, and the number of possible pending
interrupts is kept small. Secondly, this should incentivize the development of a
proper openpic emulation that would be better suited for RT.

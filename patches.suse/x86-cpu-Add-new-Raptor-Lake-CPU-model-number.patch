Subject: x86/cpu: Add new Raptor Lake CPU model number
Git-commit: ea902bcc1943f7539200ec464de3f54335588774
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc3
References: git fixes
X-Info: dependent patch for 6795e558e9cc6123c24e2100a2ebe88e58a792bc 69ced4160969025821f2999ff92163ed26568f1c

Note1: Model 0xB7 already claimed the "no suffix" #define for a regular
client part, so add (yet another) suffix "S" to distinguish this new
part from the earlier one.

Note2: the RAPTORLAKE* and ALDERLAKE* processors are very similar from a
software enabling point of view.  There are no known features that have
model-specific enabling and also differ between the two.  In other words,
every single place that list *one* or more RAPTORLAKE* or ALDERLAKE*
processors should list all of them.

Note3: This is being merged before there is an in-tree user.  Merging
this provides an "anchor" so that the different folks can update their
subsystems (like perf) in parallel to use this define and test it.

[ dhansen: add a note about why this has no in-tree users yet ]

Subject: [PATCH] intel_idle: Fix max_cstate for processor models without
 C-state tables
Git-commit: 4e0ba5577dba686f96c1c10ef4166380667fdec7
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc2
References: bsc#1175543

Currently intel_idle driver gets the c-state information from ACPI
_CST if the processor model is not recognized by it. However the
c-state in _CST starts with index 1 which is different from the
index in intel_idle driver's internal c-state table.

While intel_idle_max_cstate_reached() was previously introduced to
deal with intel_idle driver's internal c-state table, re-using
this function directly on _CST is incorrect.

Fix this by subtracting 1 from the index when checking max_cstate
in the _CST case.

For example, append intel_idle.max_cstate=1 in boot command line,
Before the patch:
grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state*/name
POLL
After the patch:
grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state*/name
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state0/name:POLL
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state1/name:C1_ACPI

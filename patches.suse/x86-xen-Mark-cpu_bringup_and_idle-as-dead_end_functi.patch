Subject: [PATCH] x86/xen: Mark cpu_bringup_and_idle() as dead_end_function
Git-commit: 9af9dcf11bda3e2c0e24c1acaacb8685ad974e93
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: stable-5.14.19

[ Upstream commit 9af9dcf11bda3e2c0e24c1acaacb8685ad974e93 ]

The asm_cpu_bringup_and_idle() function is required to push the return
value on the stack in order to make ORC happy, but the only reason
objtool doesn't complain is because of a happy accident.

The thing is that asm_cpu_bringup_and_idle() doesn't return, so
validate_branch() never terminates and falls through to the next
function, which in the normal case is the hypercall_page. And that, as
it happens, is 4095 NOPs and a RET.

Make asm_cpu_bringup_and_idle() terminate on it's own, by making the
function it calls as a dead-end. This way we no longer rely on what
code happens to come after.

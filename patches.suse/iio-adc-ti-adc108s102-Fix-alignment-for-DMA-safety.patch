Subject: [PATCH] iio: adc: ti-adc108s102: Fix alignment for DMA safety

Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

____cacheline_aligned is an insufficient guarantee for non-coherent DMA
on platforms with 128 byte cachelines above L1.  Switch to the updated
IIO_DMA_MINALIGN definition.

Dual fixes tags as two cases that were introduced in different patches.
One of those patches is a fix however and likely to have been backported
to stable kernels.

Note the second alignment marking is likely to be unnecessary, but is
left for now to keep this fix simple.

Fixes: 3691e5a69449 ("iio: adc: add driver for the ti-adc084s021 chip")
Fixes: cbe5c6977604 ("iio: adc: ti-adc108s102: Fix alignment of buffer pushed to iio buffers.")

Subject: [PATCH] Documentation/hw-vuln: Document the interaction between IBRS and STIBP
Git-commit: e02b50ca442e88122e1302d4dbc1b71a4808c13f
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

Explain why STIBP is needed with legacy IBRS as currently implemented
(KERNEL_IBRS) and why STIBP is not needed when enhanced IBRS is enabled.

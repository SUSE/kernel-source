Subject: [PATCH] SMB3: fix readpage for large swap cache
Git-commit: f2a26a3cff27dfa456fef386fe5df56dcb4b47b6
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc4
References: bsc#1192606

readpage was calculating the offset of the page incorrectly
for the case of large swapcaches.

    loff_t offset = (loff_t)page->index << PAGE_SHIFT;

As pointed out by Matthew Wilcox, this needs to use
page_file_offset() to calculate the offset instead.
Pages coming from the swap cache have page->index set
to their index within the swapcache, not within the backing
file.  For a sufficiently large swapcache, we could have
overlapping values of page->index within the same backing file.

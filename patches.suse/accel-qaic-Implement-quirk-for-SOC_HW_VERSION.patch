Subject: accel/qaic: Implement quirk for SOC_HW_VERSION
Git-commit: 4c8874c2a6512b9fe7285cab1a6910d9211a6cfb
Patch-mainline: v6.7
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

The SOC_HW_VERSION register in the BHI space is not correctly initialized
by the device and in many cases contains uninitialized data. The register
could contain 0xFFFFFFFF which is a special value to indicate a link
error in PCIe, therefore if observed, we could incorrectly think the
device is down.

Intercept reads for this register, and provide the correct value - every
production instance would read 0x60110200 if the device was operating as
intended.

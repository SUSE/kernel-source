Subject: [PATCH] cifs_atomic_open(): fix double-put on late allocation failure
Git-commit: d9a9f4849fe0c9d560851ab22a85a666cddfdd24
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc6
References: bsc#1192606

several iterations of ->atomic_open() calling conventions ago, we
used to need fput() if ->atomic_open() failed at some point after
successful finish_open().  Now (since 2016) it's not needed -
struct file carries enough state to make fput() work regardless
of the point in struct file lifecycle and discarding it on
failure exits in open() got unified.  Unfortunately, I'd missed
the fact that we had an instance of ->atomic_open() (cifs one)
that used to need that fput(), as well as the stale comment in
finish_open() demanding such late failure handling.  Trivially
fixed...

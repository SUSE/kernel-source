Subject: x86/mm: fix poking_init() for Xen PV guests
Git-commit: 26ce6ec364f18d2915923bc05784084e54a5c4cc
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc4
References: git-fixes

Commit 3f4c8211d982 ("x86/mm: Use mm_alloc() in poking_init()") broke
the kernel for running as Xen PV guest.

It seems as if the new address space is never activated before being
used, resulting in Xen rejecting to accept the new CR3 value (the PGD
isn't pinned).

Fix that by adding the now missing call of paravirt_arch_dup_mmap() to
poking_init(). That call was previously done by dup_mm()->dup_mmap() and
it is a NOP for all cases but for Xen PV, where it is just doing the
pinning of the PGD.

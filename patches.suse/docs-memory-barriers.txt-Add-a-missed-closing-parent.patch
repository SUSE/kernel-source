Subject: docs/memory-barriers.txt: Add a missed closing parenthesis
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
Git-commit: 1ab8f2486b8fc8927dff63c0d9a653fe454fafb6
References: git-fixes

The description of io_stop_wc(), which was added by commit d5624bb29f49
("asm-generic: introduce io_stop_wc() and add implementation for ARM64"),
has an unclosed parenthesis.  This commit closes it.

  (*) io_stop_wc();
 
      For memory accesses with write-combining attributes (e.g. those returned
-     by ioremap_wc(), the CPU may wait for prior accesses to be merged with
+     by ioremap_wc()), the CPU may wait for prior accesses to be merged with
      subsequent ones. io_stop_wc() can be used to prevent the merging of
      write-combining memory accesses before this macro with those after it when
      such wait has performance implications.

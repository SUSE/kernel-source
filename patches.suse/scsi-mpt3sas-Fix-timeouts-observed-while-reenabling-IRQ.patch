Subject: scsi: mpt3sas: Fix timeouts observed while reenabling IRQ
Git-commit: 5feed64f9199ff90c4239971733f23f30aeb2484
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc3
References: git-fixes

While reenabling the IRQ after irq poll there may be small time window
where HBA firmware has posted some replies and raise the interrupts but
driver has not received the interrupts. So we may observe I/O timeouts as
the driver has not processed the replies as interrupts got missed while
reenabling the IRQ.

To fix this issue the driver has to go for one more round of processing the
reply descriptors from reply descriptor post queue after enabling the IRQ.

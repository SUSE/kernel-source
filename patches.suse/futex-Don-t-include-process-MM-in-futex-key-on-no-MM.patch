Subject: [PATCH] futex: Don't include process MM in futex key on no-MMU
Git-commit: c73801ae4f22b390228ebf471d55668e824198b6
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

On no-MMU, all futexes are treated as private because there is no need
to map a virtual address to physical to match the futex across
processes. This doesn't quite work though, because private futexes
include the current process's mm_struct as part of their key. This makes
it impossible for one process to wake up a shared futex being waited on
in another process.

Fix this bug by excluding the mm_struct from the key. With
a single address space, the futex address is already a unique key.

Fixes: 784bdf3bb694 ("futex: Assume all mappings are private on !MMU systems")

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6dl: add missing properties for sram
Git-commit: f5848b95633d598bacf0500e0108dc5961af88c0

All 3 properties are required by sram.yaml. Fixes the dtbs_check warning:
Sram@900000: '#address-cells' is a required property
Sram@900000: '#size-cells' is a required property
Sram@900000: 'ranges' is a required property

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for Plantronics headsets to fix control names
Git-commit: 486f6205c233da1baa309bde5f634eb1f8319a33
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: stable-fixes

Many Poly/Plantronics headset families name the feature, input,
and/or output units in a such a way to produce control names
that are not recognized by user space. As such, the volume and
mute events do not get routed to the headset's audio controls.

As an example from a product family:

The microphone mute control is named
Headset Microphone Capture Switch
and the headset volume control is named
Headset Earphone Playback Volume

The quirk fixes these to become
Headset Capture Switch
Headset Playback Volume

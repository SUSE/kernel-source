Subject: [PATCH] HID: hid-steam: Don't use cancel_delayed_work_sync in IRQ context
Git-commit: b051ffa2aeb2a60e092387b6fb2af1ad42f51a3c
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc3
References: git-fixes

Lockdep reported that, as steam_do_deck_input_event is called from
steam_raw_event inside of an IRQ context, it can lead to issues if that IRQ
occurs while the work to be cancelled is running. By using cancel_delayed_work,
this issue can be avoided. The exact ordering of the work and the event
processing is not super important, so this is safe.

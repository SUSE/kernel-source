Subject: selftests/bpf: Better clean up for runqslower in
 test_bpftool_build.sh
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
Git-commit: 87ee33bfdd4f74edc1548c7f0140800cfcc33039
References: jsc#PED-1377

The script test_bpftool_build.sh attempts to build bpftool in the
various supported ways, to make sure nothing breaks.

One of those ways is to run "make tools/bpf" from the root of the kernel
repository. This command builds bpftool, along with the other tools
under tools/bpf, and runqslower in particular. After running the
command and upon a successful bpftool build, the script attempts to
cleanup the generated objects. However, after building with this target
and in the case of runqslower, the files are not cleaned up as expected.

This is because the "tools/bpf" target sets $(OUTPUT) to
.../tools/bpf/runqslower/ when building the tool, causing the object
files to be placed directly under the runqslower directory. But when
running "cd tools/bpf; make clean", the value for $(OUTPUT) is set to
".output" (relative to the runqslower directory) by runqslower's
Makefile, and this is where the Makefile looks for files to clean up.

We cannot easily fix in the root Makefile (where "tools/bpf" is defined)
or in tools/scripts/Makefile.include (setting $(OUTPUT)), where changing
the way the output variables are passed would likely have consequences
elsewhere. We could change runqslower's Makefile to build in the
repository instead of in a dedicated ".output/", but doing so just to
accommodate a test script doesn't sound great. Instead, let's just make
sure that we clean up runqslower properly by adding the correct command
to the script.

This will attempt to clean runqslower twice: the first try with command
"cd tools/bpf; make clean" will search for tools/bpf/runqslower/.output
and fail to clean it (but will still clean the other tools, in
particular bpftool), the second one (added in this commit) sets the
$(OUTPUT) variable like for building with the "tool/bpf" target and
should succeed.

Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: stream: Revert "soundwire: stream: fix programming slave ports for non-continous port maps"
Message-ID: <20240909164746.136629-1-krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, alsa-devel ML
References: bsc#1230350

This reverts commit ab8d66d132bc8f1992d3eb6cab8d32dda6733c84 because it
breaks codecs using non-continuous masks in source and sink ports.  The
commit missed the point that port numbers are not used as indices for
iterating over prop.sink_ports or prop.source_ports.

Soundwire core and existing codecs expect that the array passed as
prop.sink_ports and prop.source_ports is continuous.  The port mask still
might be non-continuous, but that's unrelated.

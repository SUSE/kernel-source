Subject: [PATCH] selftests/damon/damos_quota: make real expectation of quota exceeds
Git-commit: 1c684d77dfbcf926e0dd28f6d260e8fdd8a58e85
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: git-fixes

Patch series "selftests/damon: three fixes for false results".

Fix three DAMON selftest bugs that cause two and one false positive
failures and successes.


This patch (of 3):

damos_quota.py assumes the quota will always exceeded.  But whether quota
will be exceeded or not depend on the monitoring results.  Actually the
monitored workload has chaning access pattern and hence sometimes the
quota may not really be exceeded.  As a result, false positive test
failures happen.  Expect how much time the quota will be exceeded by
checking the monitoring results, and use it instead of the naive
assumption.

Subject: [PATCH] arm/xen: Don't probe xenbus as part of an early initcall

After Commit 3499ba8198cad ("xen: Fix event channel callback via
INTX/GSI"), xenbus_probe() will be called too early on Arm. This will
recent to a guest hang during boot.

If the hang wasn't there, we would have ended up to call
xenbus_probe() twice (the second time is in xenbus_probe_initcall()).

We don't need to initialize xenbus_probe() early for Arm guest.
Therefore, the call in xen_guest_init() is now removed.

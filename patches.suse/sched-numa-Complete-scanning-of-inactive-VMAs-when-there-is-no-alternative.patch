Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Complete scanning of inactive VMAs when there is
 no alternative

References: bsc#1212887 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: f169c62ff7cd1acf8bac8ae17bfeafa307d9e6fa
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git

VMAs are skipped if there is no recent fault activity but this represents
a chicken-and-egg problem as there may be no fault activity if the PTEs
are never updated to trap NUMA hints. There is an indirect reliance on
scanning to be forced early in the lifetime of a task but this may fail
to detect changes in phase behaviour. Force inactive VMAs to be scanned
when all other eligible VMAs have been updated within the same scan
sequence.

Test results in general look good with some changes in performance, both
negative and positive, depending on whether the additional scanning and
faulting was beneficial or not to the workload. The autonuma benchmark
workload NUMA01_THREADLOCAL was picked for closer examination. The workload
creates two processes with numerous threads and thread-local storage that
is zero-filled in a loop. It exercises the corner case where unrelated
threads may skip VMAs that are thread-local to another thread and still
has some VMAs that inactive while the workload executes.

The VMA skipping activity frequency with and without the patch:

	6.6.0-rc2-sched-numabtrace-v1
	=============================
	    649 reason=scan_delay
	  9,094 reason=unsuitable
	 48,915 reason=shared_ro
	143,919 reason=inaccessible
	193,050 reason=pid_inactive

	6.6.0-rc2-sched-numabselective-v1
	=============================
	    146 reason=seq_completed
	    622 reason=ignore_pid_inactive

	    624 reason=scan_delay
	  6,570 reason=unsuitable
	 16,101 reason=shared_ro
	 27,608 reason=inaccessible
	 41,939 reason=pid_inactive

Note that with the patch applied, the PID activity is ignored
(ignore_pid_inactive) to ensure a VMA with some activity is completely
scanned. In addition, a small number of VMAs are scanned when no other
eligible VMA is available during a single scan window (seq_completed).
The number of times a VMA is skipped due to no PID activity from the
scanning task (pid_inactive) drops dramatically. It is expected that
this will increase the number of PTEs updated for NUMA hinting faults
as well as hinting faults but these represent PTEs that would otherwise
have been missed. The tradeoff is scan+fault overhead versus improving
locality due to migration.

On a 2-socket Cascade Lake test machine, the time to complete the
workload is as follows;

                                                 6.6.0-rc2              6.6.0-rc2
                                       sched-numabtrace-v1 sched-numabselective-v1
  Min       elsp-NUMA01_THREADLOCAL      174.22 (   0.00%)      117.64 (  32.48%)
  Amean     elsp-NUMA01_THREADLOCAL      175.68 (   0.00%)      123.34 *  29.79%*
  Stddev    elsp-NUMA01_THREADLOCAL        1.20 (   0.00%)        4.06 (-238.20%)
  CoeffVar  elsp-NUMA01_THREADLOCAL        0.68 (   0.00%)        3.29 (-381.70%)
  Max       elsp-NUMA01_THREADLOCAL      177.18 (   0.00%)      128.03 (  27.74%)

The time to complete the workload is reduced by almost 30%:

                     6.6.0-rc2   6.6.0-rc2
                  sched-numabtrace-v1 sched-numabselective-v1 /
  Duration User       91201.80    63506.64
  Duration System      2015.53     1819.78
  Duration Elapsed     1234.77      868.37

In this specific case, system CPU time was not increased but it's not
universally true.

From vmstat, the NUMA scanning and fault activity is as follows;

                                        6.6.0-rc2      6.6.0-rc2
                              sched-numabtrace-v1 sched-numabselective-v1
  Ops NUMA base-page range updates       64272.00    26374386.00
  Ops NUMA PTE updates                   36624.00       55538.00
  Ops NUMA PMD updates                      54.00       51404.00
  Ops NUMA hint faults                   15504.00       75786.00
  Ops NUMA hint local faults %           14860.00       56763.00
  Ops NUMA hint local percent               95.85          74.90
  Ops NUMA pages migrated                 1629.00     6469222.00

Both the number of PTE updates and hint faults is dramatically
increased. While this is superficially unfortunate, it represents
ranges that were simply skipped without the patch. As a result
of the scanning and hinting faults, many more pages were also
migrated but as the time to completion is reduced, the overhead
is offset by the gain.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: kms: Fix previous HVS commit wait
Git-commit: 6052a3110be208e547a4a8aeb184446199a16e8a
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc4
References: git-fixes

Our current code is supposed to serialise the commits by waiting for all
the drm_crtc_commits associated to the previous HVS state.

However, assuming we have two CRTCs running and being configured and we
configure each one alternately, we end up in a situation where we're
not waiting at all.

Indeed, starting with a state (state 0) where both CRTCs are running,
and doing a commit (state 1) on the first CRTC (CRTC 0), we'll associate
its commit to its assigned FIFO in vc4_hvs_state.

If we get a new commit (state 2), this time affecting the second CRTC
(CRTC 1), the DRM core will allow both commits to execute in parallel
(assuming they don't have any share resources).

Our code in vc4_atomic_commit_tail is supposed to make sure we only get
one commit at a time and serialised by order of submission. It does so
by using for_each_old_crtc_in_state, making sure that the CRTC has a
FIFO assigned, is used, and has a commit pending. If it does, then we'll
wait for the commit before going forward.

During the transition from state 0 to state 1, as our old CRTC state we
get the CRTC 0 state 0, its commit, we wait for it, everything works fine.

During the transition from state 1 to state 2 though, the use of
for_each_old_crtc_in_state is wrong. Indeed, while the code assumes it's
returning the state of the CRTC in the old state (so CRTC 0 state 1), it
actually returns the old state of the CRTC affected by the current
commit, so CRTC 0 state 0 since it wasn't part of state 1.

Due to this, if we alternate between the configuration of CRTC 0 and
CRTC 1, we never actually wait for anything since we should be waiting
on the other every time, but it never is affected by the previous
commit.

Change the logic to, at every commit, look at every FIFO in the previous
HVS state, and if it's in use and has a commit associated to it, wait
for that commit.

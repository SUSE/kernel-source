Subject: [PATCH] xfs: allow symlinks with short remote targets
Git-commit: 38de567906d95c397d87f292b892686b7ec6fbc3
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc2
References: bsc#1229160

An internal user complained about log recovery failing on a symlink
("Bad dinode after recovery") with the following (excerpted) format:

core.magic = 0x494e
core.mode = 0120777
core.version = 3
core.format = 2 (extents)
core.nlinkv2 = 1
core.nextents = 1
core.size = 297
core.nblocks = 1
core.naextents = 0
core.forkoff = 0
core.aformat = 2 (extents)
u3.bmx[0] = [startoff,startblock,blockcount,extentflag]
0:[0,12,1,0]

This is a symbolic link with a 297-byte target stored in a disk block,
which is to say this is a symlink with a remote target.  The forkoff is
0, which is to say that there's 512 - 176 == 336 bytes in the inode core
to store the data fork.

Eventually, testing of generic/388 failed with the same inode corruption
message during inode recovery.  In writing a debugging patch to call
xfs_dinode_verify on dirty inode log items when we're committing
transactions, I observed that xfs/298 can reproduce the problem quite
quickly.

xfs/298 creates a symbolic link, adds some extended attributes, then
deletes them all.  The test failure occurs when the final removexattr
also deletes the attr fork because that does not convert the remote
symlink back into a shortform symlink.  That is how we trip this test.
The only reason why xfs/298 only triggers with the debug patch added is
that it deletes the symlink, so the final iflush shows the inode as
free.

I wrote a quick fstest to emulate the behavior of xfs/298, except that
it leaves the symlinks on the filesystem after inducing the "corrupt"
state.  Kernels going back at least as far as 4.18 have written out
symlink inodes in this manner and prior to 1eb70f54c445f they did not
object to reading them back in.

Because we've been writing out inodes this way for quite some time, the
only way to fix this is to relax the check for symbolic links.
Directories don't have this problem because di_size is bumped to
blocksize during the sf->data conversion.

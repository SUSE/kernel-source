Subject: drm: fix up fbdev Kconfig defaults
Git-commit: bb6c4507fe825f1b4904fc3ffd329ab196c5e645
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc3
References: drm-backport-placeholder jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

As a result of the recent Kconfig reworks, the default settings for the
framebuffer interfaces changed in unexpected ways:

Configurations that leave CONFIG_FB disabled but use DRM now get
DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION by default. This also turns on the deprecated /dev/fb
device nodes for machines that don't actually want it.

In turn, configurations that previously had DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION enabled
now only get the /dev/fb front-end but not the more useful framebuffer
console, which is not selected any more.

We had previously decided that any combination of the three frontends
(FB_DEVICE, FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE and LOGO) should be selectable, but the
new default settings mean that a lot of defconfig files would have to
get adapted.

Change the defaults back to what they were in Linux 6.5:

 - Leave DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION turned off unless CONFIG_FB
   is enabled. Previously this was a hard dependency but now the two are
   independent. However, configurations that enable CONFIG_FB probably
   also want to keep the emulation for DRM, while those without FB
   presumably did that intentionally in the past.

 - Leave FB_DEVICE turned off for FB=n. Following the same
   logic, the deprecated option should not automatically get enabled
   here, most users that had FB turned off in the past do not want it,
   even if they want the console

 - Turn the FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE option on if
   DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION is set to avoid having to change defconfig
   files that relied on it being selected unconditionally in the past.
   This also makes sense since both LOGO and FB_DEVICE are now disabled
   by default for builds without CONFIG_FB, but DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION
   would make no sense if all three are disabled.

Fixes: a5ae331edb02b ("drm: Drop select FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE for DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION")
Fixes: 701d2054fa317 ("fbdev: Make support for userspace interfaces configurable")

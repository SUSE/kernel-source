Subject: [PATCH] printk: ringbuffer: Cleanup reader terminology

References: bsc#1214683 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
Git-commit: 584528d621459d1a5c31da7a591218ad3bb96d6c

With the lockless ringbuffer, it is allowed that multiple
CPUs/contexts write simultaneously into the buffer. This creates
an ambiguity as some writers will finalize sooner.

The documentation for the prb_read functions is not clear as it
refers to "not yet written" and "no data available". Clarify the
return values and language to be in terms of the reader: records
available for reading.

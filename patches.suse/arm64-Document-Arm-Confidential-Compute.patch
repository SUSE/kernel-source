for RIPAS RAM.

+=====================================
+Arm Confidential Compute Architecture
+=====================================
+
+Arm systems that support the Realm Management Extension (RME) contain
+hardware to allow a VM guest to be run in a way which protects the code
+and data of the guest from the hypervisor. It extends the older "two
+world" model (Normal and Secure World) into four worlds: Normal, Secure,
+Root and Realm. Linux can then also be run as a guest to a monitor
+running in the Realm world.
+
+The monitor running in the Realm world is known as the Realm Management
+Monitor (RMM) and implements the Realm Management Monitor
+specification[1]. The monitor acts a bit like a hypervisor (e.g. it runs
+in EL2 and manages the stage 2 page tables etc of the guests running in
+Realm world), however much of the control is handled by a hypervisor
+running in the Normal World. The Normal World hypervisor uses the Realm
+Management Interface (RMI) defined by the RMM specification to request
+the RMM to perform operations (e.g. mapping memory or executing a vCPU).
+
+The RMM defines an environment for guests where the address space (IPA)
+is split into two. The lower half is protected - any memory that is
+mapped in this half cannot be seen by the Normal World and the RMM
+restricts what operations the Normal World can perform on this memory
+(e.g. the Normal World cannot replace pages in this region without the
+guest's cooperation). The upper half is shared, the Normal World is free
+to make changes to the pages in this region, and is able to emulate MMIO
+devices in this region too.
+
+A guest running in a Realm may also communicate with the RMM using the
+Realm Services Interface (RSI) to request changes in its environment or
+to perform attestation about its environment. In particular it may
+request that areas of the protected address space are transitioned
+between 'RAM' and 'EMPTY' (in either direction). This allows a Realm
+guest to give up memory to be returned to the Normal World, or to
+request new memory from the Normal World.  Without an explicit request
+from the Realm guest the RMM will otherwise prevent the Normal World
+from making these changes.
+
+Linux as a Realm Guest
+----------------------
+
+To run Linux as a guest within a Realm, the following must be provided
+either by the VMM or by a `boot loader` run in the Realm before Linux:
+
+ * All protected RAM described to Linux (by DT or ACPI) must be marked
+   RIPAS RAM before handing control over to Linux.
+
+ * MMIO devices must be either unprotected (e.g. emulated by the Normal
+   World) or marked RIPAS DEV.
+
+ * MMIO devices emulated by the Normal World and used very early in boot
+   (specifically earlycon) must be specified in the upper half of IPA.
+   For earlycon this can be done by specifying the address on the
+   command line, e.g. with an IPA size of 33 bits and the base address
+   of the emulated UART at 0x1000000: ``earlycon=uart,mmio,0x101000000``
+
+ * Linux will use bounce buffers for communicating with unprotected
+   devices. It will transition some protected memory to RIPAS EMPTY and
+   expect to be able to access unprotected pages at the same IPA address
+   but with the highest valid IPA bit set. The expectation is that the
+   VMM will remove the physical pages from the protected mapping and
+   provide those pages as unprotected pages.

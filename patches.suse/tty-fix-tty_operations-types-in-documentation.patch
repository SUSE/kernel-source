Subject: [PATCH] tty: fix tty_operations types in documentation

References: bsc#1232534 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
Git-commit: 358779dd18c1e8531bd6d78c19ed802958d7c677

Commits 95713967ba52 ("tty: make tty_operations::write()'s count
size_t") and dcaafbe6ee3b ("tty: propagate u8 data to
tty_operations::put_char()") changed types of characters to u8, but
omitted to fix the documentation.

Fix the latter now.

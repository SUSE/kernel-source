Subject: [PATCH] docs: doc-guide: clarify latest theme usage
Git-commit: 5ccab49c104c2237f1573961857d9b173fcd9a12
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

We have been using the Alabaster theme as the default theme since
Sept. 2022.

Keep the information on the RTD theme around in case someone wants to
try it with the DOCS_THEME environment variable.

Fixes: 26d797ffc1c0 ("docs: update sphinx.rst to reflect the default theme change")

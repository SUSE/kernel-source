Subject: [PATCH] clk: meson: g12a: fix gp0 and hifi ranges
Git-commit: bc794f8c56abddf709f1f84fcb2a3c9e7d9cc9b4
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

While some SoC samples are able to lock with a PLL factor of 55, others
samples can't. ATM, a minimum of 60 appears to work on all the samples
I have tried.

Even with 60, it sometimes takes a long time for the PLL to eventually
lock. The documentation says that the minimum rate of these PLLs DCO
should be 3GHz, a factor of 125. Let's use that to be on the safe side.

With factor range changed, the PLL seems to lock quickly (enough) so far.
It is still unclear if the range was the only reason for the delay.

Subject: net: dsa: tag_ksz: Extend ksz9477_xmit() for HSR frame duplication
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
Git-commit: 5e5db71a92c537ff37149b58bba6a8b2588a46f0
References: bsc#1232178

The KSZ9477 has support for HSR (High-Availability Seamless Redundancy).
One of its offloading (i.e. performed in the switch IC hardware) features
is to duplicate received frame to both HSR aware switch ports.

To achieve this goal - the tail TAG needs to be modified. To be more
specific, both ports must be marked as destination (egress) ones.

The NETIF_F_HW_HSR_DUP flag indicates that the device supports HSR and
assures (in HSR core code) that frame is sent only once from HOST to
switch with tail tag indicating both ports.

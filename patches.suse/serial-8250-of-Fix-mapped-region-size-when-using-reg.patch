Subject: [PATCH] serial: 8250: of: Fix mapped region size when using reg-offset property
Git-commit: d06b1cf28297e27127d3da54753a3a01a2fa2f28
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc2
References: git-fixes

8250_of supports a reg-offset property which is intended to handle
cases where the device registers start at an offset inside the region
of memory allocated to the device. The Xilinx 16550 UART, for which this
support was initially added, requires this. However, the code did not
adjust the overall size of the mapped region accordingly, causing the
driver to request an area of memory past the end of the device's
allocation. For example, if the UART was allocated an address of
0xb0130000, size of 0x10000 and reg-offset of 0x1000 in the device
tree, the region of memory reserved was b0131000-b0140fff, which caused
the driver for the region starting at b0140000 to fail to probe.

Fix this by subtracting reg-offset from the mapped region size.

Subject: clocksource: hyper-v: Use lapic timer in a TDX VM without paravisor
Git-commit: 7f828d5fff7d24752e1ecf6bebb6617a81f97b93
References: git-fixes

In a TDX VM without paravisor, currently the default timer is the Hyper-V
timer, which depends on the slow VM Reference Counter MSR: the Hyper-V TSC
page is not enabled in such a VM because the VM uses Invariant TSC as a
better clocksource and it's challenging to mark the Hyper-V TSC page shared
in very early boot.

Lower the rating of the Hyper-V timer so the local APIC timer becomes the
the default timer in such a VM, and print a warning in case Invariant TSC
is unavailable in such a VM. This change should cause no perceivable
performance difference.

Subject: drm/i915: Extend Wa_14015795083 platforms
Git-commit: 6580176fd04331130d94de3022c5eab97dee577e
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1

This workaround was already implemented for DG2, PVC, and some steppings
of MTL, but the workaround database has now been updated to extend this
workaround to TGL, RKL, DG1, and ADL.

v2:
 - Skip readback verification for these extra gen12lp platforms.  On
   some of the platforms, the firmware locks this register, preventing
   the driver from making any modifications.  We should still try to
   apply the workaround, but if the register is locked and the value
   doesn't stick, that's semi-expected and not something we want to flag
   as a driver error on debug builds.

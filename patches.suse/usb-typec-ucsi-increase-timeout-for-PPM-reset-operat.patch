Subject: [PATCH] usb: typec: ucsi: increase timeout for PPM reset operations
Git-commit: bf4f9ae1cb08ccaafbe6874be6c46f59b83ae778
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: git-fixes

It is observed that on some systems an initial PPM reset during the boot
phase can trigger a timeout:

[    6.482546] ucsi_acpi USBC000:00: failed to reset PPM!
[    6.482551] ucsi_acpi USBC000:00: error -ETIMEDOUT: PPM init failed

Still, increasing the timeout value, albeit being the most straightforward
solution, eliminates the problem: the initial PPM reset may take up to
~8000-10000ms on some Lenovo laptops. When it is reset after the above
period of time (or even if ucsi_reset_ppm() is not called overall), UCSI
works as expected.

Moreover, if the ucsi_acpi module is loaded/unloaded manually after the
system has booted, reading the CCI values and resetting the PPM works
perfectly, without any timeout. Thus it's only a boot-time issue.

The reason for this behavior is not clear but it may be the consequence
of some tricks that the firmware performs or be an actual firmware bug.
As a workaround, increase the timeout to avoid failing the UCSI
initialization prematurely.

Subject: ARM: dts: Fix dcan driver probe failed on am437x platform
Git-commit: 2a4117df9b436a0e4c79d211284ab2097bcd00dc
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc6
References: git-fixes

Got following d_can probe errors with kernel 5.8-rc1 on am437x

[   10.730822] CAN device driver interface
Starting Wait for Network to be Configured...
[  OK  ] Reached target Network.
[   10.787363] c_can_platform 481cc000.can: probe failed
[   10.792484] c_can_platform: probe of 481cc000.can failed with error -2
[   10.799457] c_can_platform 481d0000.can: probe failed
[   10.804617] c_can_platform: probe of 481d0000.can failed with error -2

actually, Tony has fixed this issue on am335x with the patch [3]

Since am437x has the same clock structure with am335x
[1][2], so reuse the code from Tony Lindgren's patch [3] to fix it.

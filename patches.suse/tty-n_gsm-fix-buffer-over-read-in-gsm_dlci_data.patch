Subject: [PATCH] tty: n_gsm: fix buffer over-read in gsm_dlci_data()
Git-commit: fd442e5ba30aaa75ea47b32149e7a3110dc20a46
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc7
References: git-fixes

'len' is decreased after each octet that has its EA bit set to 0, which
means that the value is encoded with additional octets. However, the final
octet does not decreases 'len' which results in 'len' being one byte too
long. A buffer over-read may occur in tty_insert_flip_string() as it tries
to read one byte more than the passed content size of 'data'.
Decrease 'len' also for the final octet which has the EA bit set to 1 to
write the correct number of bytes from the internal receive buffer to the
virtual tty.

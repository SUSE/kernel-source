Subject: [PATCH] shm: extend forced shm destroy to support objects from several IPC nses
Git-commit: 85b6d24646e4125c591639841169baa98a2da503
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc2
References: git-fixes

Currently, the exit_shm() function not designed to work properly when
task->sysvshm.shm_clist holds shm objects from different IPC namespaces.

This is a real pain when sysctl kernel.shm_rmid_forced = 1, because it
leads to use-after-free (reproducer exists).

This is an attempt to fix the problem by extending exit_shm mechanism to
handle shm's destroy from several IPC ns'es.

To achieve that we do several things:

1. add a namespace (non-refcounted) pointer to the struct shmid_kernel

2. during new shm object creation (newseg()/shmget syscall) we
   initialize this pointer by current task IPC ns

3. exit_shm() fully reworked such that it traverses over all shp's in
   task->sysvshm.shm_clist and gets IPC namespace not from current task
   as it was before but from shp's object itself, then call
   shm_destroy(shp, ns).

Note: We need to be really careful here, because as it was said before
(1), our pointer to IPC ns non-refcnt'ed.  To be on the safe side we
using special helper get_ipc_ns_not_zero() which allows to get IPC ns
refcounter only if IPC ns not in the "state of destruction".

Q/A

Q: Why can we access shp->ns memory using non-refcounted pointer?
A: Because shp object lifetime is always shorther than IPC namespace
   lifetime, so, if we get shp object from the task->sysvshm.shm_clist
   while holding task_lock(task) nobody can steal our namespace.

Q: Does this patch change semantics of unshare/setns/clone syscalls?
A: No. It's just fixes non-covered case when process may leave IPC
   namespace without getting task->sysvshm.shm_clist list cleaned up.

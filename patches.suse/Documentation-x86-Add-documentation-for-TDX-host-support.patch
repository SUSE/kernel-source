Subject: Documentation/x86: Add documentation for TDX host support
Git-commit: 4e1c7dddc71708c21d7fe69cc5f8297ffb7c6965
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: jsc#PED-5824

Add documentation for TDX host kernel support.  There is already one
file Documentation/x86/tdx.rst containing documentation for TDX guest
internals.  Also reuse it for TDX host kernel support.

Introduce a new level menu "TDX Guest Support" and move existing
materials under it, and add a new menu for TDX host kernel support.

 mode sits between the host and the guest and manages the guest/host
 separation.
 
+TDX Host Kernel Support
+=======================
+
+TDX introduces a new CPU mode called Secure Arbitration Mode (SEAM) and
+a new isolated range pointed by the SEAM Ranger Register (SEAMRR).  A
+CPU-attested software module called 'the TDX module' runs inside the new
+isolated range to provide the functionalities to manage and run protected
+VMs.
+
+TDX also leverages Intel Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption (MKTME) to
+provide crypto-protection to the VMs.  TDX reserves part of MKTME KeyIDs
+as TDX private KeyIDs, which are only accessible within the SEAM mode.
+BIOS is responsible for partitioning legacy MKTME KeyIDs and TDX KeyIDs.
+
+Before the TDX module can be used to create and run protected VMs, it
+must be loaded into the isolated range and properly initialized.  The TDX
+architecture doesn't require the BIOS to load the TDX module, but the
+kernel assumes it is loaded by the BIOS.
+
+TDX boot-time detection
+-----------------------
+
+The kernel detects TDX by detecting TDX private KeyIDs during kernel
+boot.  Below dmesg shows when TDX is enabled by BIOS::
+
+  [..] virt/tdx: BIOS enabled: private KeyID range: [16, 64)
+
+TDX module initialization
+---------------------------------------
+
+The kernel talks to the TDX module via the new SEAMCALL instruction.  The
+TDX module implements SEAMCALL leaf functions to allow the kernel to
+initialize it.
+
+If the TDX module isn't loaded, the SEAMCALL instruction fails with a
+special error.  In this case the kernel fails the module initialization
+and reports the module isn't loaded::
+
+  [..] virt/tdx: module not loaded
+
+Initializing the TDX module consumes roughly ~1/256th system RAM size to
+use it as 'metadata' for the TDX memory.  It also takes additional CPU
+time to initialize those metadata along with the TDX module itself.  Both
+are not trivial.  The kernel initializes the TDX module at runtime on
+demand.
+
+Besides initializing the TDX module, a per-cpu initialization SEAMCALL
+must be done on one cpu before any other SEAMCALLs can be made on that
+cpu.
+
+The kernel provides two functions, tdx_enable() and tdx_cpu_enable() to
+allow the user of TDX to enable the TDX module and enable TDX on local
+cpu respectively.
+
+Making SEAMCALL requires VMXON has been done on that CPU.  Currently only
+KVM implements VMXON.  For now both tdx_enable() and tdx_cpu_enable()
+don't do VMXON internally (not trivial), but depends on the caller to
+guarantee that.
+
+To enable TDX, the caller of TDX should: 1) temporarily disable CPU
+hotplug; 2) do VMXON and tdx_enable_cpu() on all online cpus; 3) call
+tdx_enable().  For example::
+
+        cpus_read_lock();
+        on_each_cpu(vmxon_and_tdx_cpu_enable());
+        ret = tdx_enable();
+        cpus_read_unlock();
+        if (ret)
+                goto no_tdx;
+        // TDX is ready to use
+
+And the caller of TDX must guarantee the tdx_cpu_enable() has been
+successfully done on any cpu before it wants to run any other SEAMCALL.
+A typical usage is do both VMXON and tdx_cpu_enable() in CPU hotplug
+online callback, and refuse to online if tdx_cpu_enable() fails.
+
+User can consult dmesg to see whether the TDX module has been initialized.
+
+If the TDX module is initialized successfully, dmesg shows something
+like below::
+
+  [..] virt/tdx: 262668 KBs allocated for PAMT
+  [..] virt/tdx: module initialized
+
+If the TDX module failed to initialize, dmesg also shows it failed to
+initialize::
+
+  [..] virt/tdx: module initialization failed ...
+
+TDX Interaction to Other Kernel Components
+------------------------------------------
+
+TDX Memory Policy
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+TDX reports a list of "Convertible Memory Region" (CMR) to tell the
+kernel which memory is TDX compatible.  The kernel needs to build a list
+of memory regions (out of CMRs) as "TDX-usable" memory and pass those
+regions to the TDX module.  Once this is done, those "TDX-usable" memory
+regions are fixed during module's lifetime.
+
+To keep things simple, currently the kernel simply guarantees all pages
+in the page allocator are TDX memory.  Specifically, the kernel uses all
+system memory in the core-mm "at the time of TDX module initialization"
+as TDX memory, and in the meantime, refuses to online any non-TDX-memory
+in the memory hotplug.
+
+Physical Memory Hotplug
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Note TDX assumes convertible memory is always physically present during
+machine's runtime.  A non-buggy BIOS should never support hot-removal of
+any convertible memory.  This implementation doesn't handle ACPI memory
+removal but depends on the BIOS to behave correctly.
+
+CPU Hotplug
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+TDX module requires the per-cpu initialization SEAMCALL must be done on
+one cpu before any other SEAMCALLs can be made on that cpu.  The kernel
+provides tdx_cpu_enable() to let the user of TDX to do it when the user
+wants to use a new cpu for TDX task.
+
+TDX doesn't support physical (ACPI) CPU hotplug.  During machine boot,
+TDX verifies all boot-time present logical CPUs are TDX compatible before
+enabling TDX.  A non-buggy BIOS should never support hot-add/removal of
+physical CPU.  Currently the kernel doesn't handle physical CPU hotplug,
+but depends on the BIOS to behave correctly.
+
+Note TDX works with CPU logical online/offline, thus the kernel still
+allows to offline logical CPU and online it again.
+
+Kexec()
+~~~~~~~
+
+TDX host support currently lacks the ability to handle kexec.  For
+simplicity only one of them can be enabled in the Kconfig.  This will be
+fixed in the future.
+
+Erratum
+~~~~~~~
+
+The first few generations of TDX hardware have an erratum.  A partial
+write to a TDX private memory cacheline will silently "poison" the
+line.  Subsequent reads will consume the poison and generate a machine
+check.
+
+A partial write is a memory write where a write transaction of less than
+cacheline lands at the memory controller.  The CPU does these via
+non-temporal write instructions (like MOVNTI), or through UC/WC memory
+mappings.  Devices can also do partial writes via DMA.
+
+Theoretically, a kernel bug could do partial write to TDX private memory
+and trigger unexpected machine check.  What's more, the machine check
+code will present these as "Hardware error" when they were, in fact, a
+software-triggered issue.  But in the end, this issue is hard to trigger.
+
+If the platform has such erratum, the kernel prints additional message in
+machine check handler to tell user the machine check may be caused by
+kernel bug on TDX private memory.
+
+Interaction vs S3 and deeper states
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+TDX cannot survive from S3 and deeper states.  The hardware resets and
+disables TDX completely when platform goes to S3 and deeper.  Both TDX
+guests and the TDX module get destroyed permanently.
+
+The kernel uses S3 for suspend-to-ram, and use S4 and deeper states for
+hibernation.  Currently, for simplicity, the kernel chooses to make TDX
+mutually exclusive with S3 and hibernation.
+
+The kernel disables TDX during early boot when hibernation support is
+available::
+
+  [..] virt/tdx: initialization failed: Hibernation support is enabled
+
+Add 'nohibernate' kernel command line to disable hibernation in order to
+use TDX.
+
+ACPI S3 is disabled during kernel early boot if TDX is enabled.  The user
+needs to turn off TDX in the BIOS in order to use S3.

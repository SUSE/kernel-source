Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Disable CRTC degamma LUT for DCN401
Git-commit: 97a0f2b5f4d4afcec34376e4428e157ce95efa71
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc7
Alt-commit: 340231cdceec2c45995d773a358ca3c341f151aa
References: stable-fixes

In DCN401 pre-blending degamma LUT isn't affecting cursor as in previous
DCN version. As this is not the behavior close to what is expected for
CRTC degamma LUT, disable CRTC degamma LUT property in this HW.

When enabling HDR on KDE, it takes the first CRTC 1D LUT available and
apply a color transformation (Gamma 2.2 -> PQ). AMD driver usually
advertises a CRTC degamma LUT as the first CRTC 1D LUT, but it's
actually applied pre-blending. In previous HW version, it seems to work
fine because the 1D LUT was applied to cursor too, but DCN401 presents a
different behavior and the 1D LUT isn't affecting the hardware cursor.

To address the wrong gamma on cursor with HDR (see the link), I came up
with this patch that disables CRTC degamma LUT in this hw, since it
presents a different behavior than others. With this KDE sees CRTC
regamma LUT as the first post-blending 1D LUT available. This is
actually more consistent with AMD color pipeline. It was tested by the
reporter, since I don't have the HW available for local testing and
debugging.

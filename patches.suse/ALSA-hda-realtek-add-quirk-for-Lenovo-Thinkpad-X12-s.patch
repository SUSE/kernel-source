Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: add quirk for Lenovo Thinkpad X12 speakers
Git-commit: 264fb03497ec1c7841bba872571bcd11beed57a7
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc3
References: git-fixes

For this specific device on Lenovo Thinkpad X12 tablet, the verbs were
dumped by qemu running a guest OS that init this codec properly.
After studying the dump, it turns out that
the same quirk used by the other Lenovo devices can be reused.

The patch was tested working against the mainline kernel.

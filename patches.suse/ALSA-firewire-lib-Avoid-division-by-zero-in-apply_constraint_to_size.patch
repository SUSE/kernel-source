Subject: ALSA: firewire-lib: Avoid division by zero in
 apply_constraint_to_size()
Git-commit: 72cafe63b35d06b5cfbaf807e90ae657907858da
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc5
References: CVE-2024-50205 bsc#1233293

The step variable is initialized to zero. It is changed in the loop,
but if it's not changed it will remain zero. Add a variable check
before the division.

The observed behavior was introduced by commit 826b5de90c0b
("ALSA: firewire-lib: fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size"),
and it is difficult to show that any of the interval parameters will
satisfy the snd_interval_test() condition with data from the
amdtp_rate_table[] table.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

Subject: [PATCH] docs/scripts/gdb: add necessary make scripts_gdb step
Git-commit: 6b219431037bf98c9efd49716aea9b68440477a3
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

In order to debug the kernel successfully with gdb you need to run
'make scripts_gdb' nowadays.

This was changed with the following commit:

Commit 67274c083438340ad16c ("scripts/gdb: delay generation of gdb
constants.py")

In order to have a complete guide for beginners this remark
should be added to the offial documentation.

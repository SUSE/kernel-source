Subject: [PATCH] wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix PNVM timeout for non-MSI-X platforms
Git-commit: b8c8a03e9b7bfc06f366b75daf3d0812400e7123
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc7
References: git-fixes

When MSI-X is not enabled, we mask all the interrupts in the interrupt
handler and re-enable them when the interrupt thread runs. If
STATUS_INT_ENABLED is not set, we won't re-enable in the thread.
In order to get the ALIVE interrupt, we allow the ALIVE interrupt
itself, and RX as well in order to receive the ALIVE notification (which
is received as an RX from the firmware.

The problem is that STATUS_INT_ENABLED is clear until the op_mode calls
trans_fw_alive which means that until trans_fw_alive is called, any
notification from the firmware will not be received.

This became a problem when we inserted the pnvm_load exactly between the
ALIVE and trans_fw_alive.

Fix that by calling trans_fw_alive before loading the PNVM. This will
allow to get the notification from the firmware about PNVM load being
complete and continue the flow normally.

This didn't happen on MSI-X because we don't disable the interrupts in
the ISR when MSI-X is available.

The error in the log looks like this:

iwlwifi 0000:00:03.0: Timeout waiting for PNVM load!
iwlwifi 0000:00:03.0: Failed to start RT ucode: -110
iwlwifi 0000:00:03.0: WRT: Collecting data: ini trigger 13 fired (delay=0ms).

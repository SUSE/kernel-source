Subject: [PATCH] firmware_loader: use -ETIMEDOUT instead of -EAGAIN in fw_load_sysfs_fallback
Git-commit: 0d6434e10b5377a006f6dd995c8fc5e2d82acddc
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc5
References: git-fixes

The only motivation for using -EAGAIN in commit 0542ad88fbdd81bb
("firmware loader: Fix _request_firmware_load() return val for fw load
abort") was to distinguish the error from -ENOMEM, and so there is no
real reason in keeping it. -EAGAIN is typically used to tell the
userspace to try something again and in this case re-using the sysfs
loading interface cannot be retried when a timeout happens, so the
return value is also bogus.

-ETIMEDOUT is received when the wait times out and returning that
is much more telling of what the reason for the failure was. So, just
propagate that instead of returning -EAGAIN.

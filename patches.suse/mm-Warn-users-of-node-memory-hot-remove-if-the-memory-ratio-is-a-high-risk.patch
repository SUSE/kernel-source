Subject: [PATCH] mm: Warn users of node memory hot-remove if the memory ratio
 is a high risk

References: Memory node hot-remove (fate#316483), fate#319143, bnc#987598
Patch-mainline: Never, upstream developers refusing to acknowledge problem

Warn users of zone_movable (currently memory hot-remove or mirrored memory) if
lowmem:movable ratio is worse than 1:3. Such a configuration can lead to all sorts
of problems and it would be good to have a reminder that the zone_movable might
be the culprit.

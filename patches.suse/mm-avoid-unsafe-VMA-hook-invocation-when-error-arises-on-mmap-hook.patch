Subject: mm: avoid unsafe VMA hook invocation when error arises on mmap hook
Git-commit: 3dd6ed34ce1f2356a77fb88edafb5ec96784e3cf
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc7
References: git-fixes

Patch series "fix error handling in mmap_region() and refactor
(hotfixes)", v4.

mmap_region() is somewhat terrifying, with spaghetti-like control flow and
numerous means by which issues can arise and incomplete state, memory
leaks and other unpleasantness can occur.

A large amount of the complexity arises from trying to handle errors late
in the process of mapping a VMA, which forms the basis of recently
observed issues with resource leaks and observable inconsistent state.

This series goes to great lengths to simplify how mmap_region() works and
to avoid unwinding errors late on in the process of setting up the VMA for
the new mapping, and equally avoids such operations occurring while the
VMA is in an inconsistent state.

The patches in this series comprise the minimal changes required to
resolve existing issues in mmap_region() error handling, in order that
they can be hotfixed and backported.  There is additionally a follow up
series which goes further, separated out from the v1 series and sent and
updated separately.


This patch (of 5):

After an attempted mmap() fails, we are no longer in a situation where we
can safely interact with VMA hooks.  This is currently not enforced,
meaning that we need complicated handling to ensure we do not incorrectly
call these hooks.

We can avoid the whole issue by treating the VMA as suspect the moment
that the file->f_ops->mmap() function reports an error by replacing
whatever VMA operations were installed with a dummy empty set of VMA
operations.

We do so through a new helper function internal to mm - mmap_file() -
which is both more logically named than the existing call_mmap() function
and correctly isolates handling of the vm_op reassignment to mm.

All the existing invocations of call_mmap() outside of mm are ultimately
nested within the call_mmap() from mm, which we now replace.

It is therefore safe to leave call_mmap() in place as a convenience
function (and to avoid churn).  The invokers are:

     ovl_file_operations -> mmap -> ovl_mmap() -> backing_file_mmap()
    coda_file_operations -> mmap -> coda_file_mmap()
     shm_file_operations -> shm_mmap()
shm_file_operations_huge -> shm_mmap()
            dma_buf_fops -> dma_buf_mmap_internal -> i915_dmabuf_ops
	                    -> i915_gem_dmabuf_mmap()

None of these callers interact with vm_ops or mappings in a problematic
way on error, quickly exiting out.

Subject: tracing: Make splice_read available again
Git-commit: e400be674a1a40e9dcb2e95f84d6c1fd2d88f31d
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc3
References: git-fixes

Since the commit 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow splice read/write
without explicit ops") is applied to the kernel, splice() and
sendfile() calls on the trace file (/sys/kernel/debug/tracing
/trace) return EINVAL.

This patch restores these system calls by initializing splice_read
in file_operations of the trace file. This patch only enables such
functionalities for the read case.

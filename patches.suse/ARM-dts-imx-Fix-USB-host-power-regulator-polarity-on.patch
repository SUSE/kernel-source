Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx: Fix USB host power regulator polarity on M53Menlo
Git-commit: 5c187e2eb3f92daa38cb3d4ab45e1107ea34108e
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc5
References: stable-5.14.12

[ Upstream commit 5c187e2eb3f92daa38cb3d4ab45e1107ea34108e ]

The MIC2025 switch input signal nEN is active low, describe it as such
in the DT. The previous change to this regulator polarity was incorrectly
influenced by broken quirks in gpiolib-of.c, which is now long fixed. So
fix this regulator polarity setting here once and for all.

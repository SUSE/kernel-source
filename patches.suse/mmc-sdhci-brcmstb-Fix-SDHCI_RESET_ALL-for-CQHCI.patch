Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci-brcmstb: Fix SDHCI_RESET_ALL for CQHCI
Git-commit: 56baa208f91061ff27ec2d93fbc483f624d373b4
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc5
References: git-fixes

[[ NOTE: this is completely untested by the author, but included solely
    because, as noted in commit df57d73276b8 ("mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix
    SDHCI_RESET_ALL for CQHCI for Intel GLK-based controllers"), "other
    drivers using CQHCI might benefit from a similar change, if they
    also have CQHCI reset by SDHCI_RESET_ALL." We've now seen the same
    bug on at least MSM, Arasan, and Intel hardware. ]]

SDHCI_RESET_ALL resets will reset the hardware CQE state, but we aren't
tracking that properly in software. When out of sync, we may trigger
various timeouts.

It's not typical to perform resets while CQE is enabled, but this may
occur in some suspend or error recovery scenarios.

Include this fix by way of the new sdhci_and_cqhci_reset() helper.

I only patch the bcm7216 variant even though others potentially *could*
provide the 'supports-cqe' property (and thus enable CQHCI), because
d46ba2d17f90 ("mmc: sdhci-brcmstb: Add support for Command Queuing
(CQE)") and some Broadcom folks confirm that only the 7216 variant
actually supports it.

This patch depends on (and should not compile without) the patch
entitled "mmc: cqhci: Provide helper for resetting both SDHCI and
CQHCI".

Fixes: d46ba2d17f90 ("mmc: sdhci-brcmstb: Add support for Command Queuing (CQE)")

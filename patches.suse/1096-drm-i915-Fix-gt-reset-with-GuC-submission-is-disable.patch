Subject: drm/i915: Fix gt reset with GuC submission is disabled
Git-commit: 4d3421e04c5dc38baf15224c051256204f223c15
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

Currently intel_gt_reset() kills the GuC and then resets requested
engines. This is problematic because there is a dedicated CSB FIFO
which only GuC can access and if that FIFO fills up, the hardware
will block on the next context switch until there is space that means
the system is effectively hung. If an engine is reset whilst actively
executing a context, a CSB entry will be sent to say that the context
has gone idle. Thus if reset happens on a very busy system then
killing GuC before killing the engines will lead to deadlock because
of filled up CSB FIFO.

To address this issue, the GuC should be killed only after resetting
the requested engines and before calling intel_gt_init_hw().

Subject: [PATCH] dma-debug: fix sg checks in debug_dma_map_sg()
Git-commit: 293d92cbbd2418ca2ba43fed07f1b92e884d1c77
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc7
References: stable-5.14.15

[ Upstream commit 293d92cbbd2418ca2ba43fed07f1b92e884d1c77 ]

The following warning occurred sporadically on s390:
Dma-api: nvme 0006:00:00.0: device driver maps memory from kernel text or rodata [addr=0000000048cc5e2f] [len=131072]
Warning: CPU: 4 PID: 825 at kernel/dma/debug.c:1083 check_for_illegal_area+0xa8/0x138

It is a false-positive warning, due to broken logic in debug_dma_map_sg().
check_for_illegal_area() checks for overlay of sg elements with kernel text
or rodata. It is called with sg_dma_len(s) instead of s->length as
parameter. After the call to ->map_sg(), sg_dma_len() will contain the
length of possibly combined sg elements in the DMA address space, and not
the individual sg element length, which would be s->length.

The check will then use the physical start address of an sg element, and
add the DMA length for the overlap check, which could result in the false
warning, because the DMA length can be larger than the actual single sg
element length.

In addition, the call to check_for_illegal_area() happens in the iteration
over mapped_ents, which will not include all individual sg elements if
any of them were combined in ->map_sg().

Fix this by using s->length instead of sg_dma_len(s). Also put the call to
check_for_illegal_area() in a separate loop, iterating over all the
individual sg elements ("nents" instead of "mapped_ents").

While at it, as suggested by Robin Murphy, also move check_for_stack()
inside the new loop, as it is similarly concerned with validating the
individual sg elements.

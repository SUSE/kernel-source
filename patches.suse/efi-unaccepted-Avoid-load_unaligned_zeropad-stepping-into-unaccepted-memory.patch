Subject: efi/unaccepted: Avoid load_unaligned_zeropad() stepping into
 unaccepted memory
Git-commit: c211c19e80d046441655e372c6ae15f29d358259
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: jsc#PED-7167

load_unaligned_zeropad() can lead to unwanted loads across page boundaries.
The unwanted loads are typically harmless. But, they might be made to
totally unrelated or even unmapped memory. load_unaligned_zeropad()
relies on exception fixup (#PF, #GP and now #VE) to recover from these
unwanted loads.

But, this approach does not work for unaccepted memory. For TDX, a load
from unaccepted memory will not lead to a recoverable exception within
the guest. The guest will exit to the VMM where the only recourse is to
terminate the guest.

There are two parts to fix this issue and comprehensively avoid access
to unaccepted memory. Together these ensure that an extra "guard" page
is accepted in addition to the memory that needs to be used.

1. Implicitly extend the range_contains_unaccepted_memory(start, end)
   checks up to end+unit_size if 'end' is aligned on a unit_size
   boundary.
2. Implicitly extend accept_memory(start, end) to end+unit_size if 'end'
   is aligned on a unit_size boundary.

Side note: This leads to something strange. Pages which were accepted
	   at boot, marked by the firmware as accepted and will never
	   _need_ to be accepted might be on unaccepted_pages list
	   This is a cue to ensure that the next page is accepted
	   before 'page' can be used.

This is an actual, real-world problem which was discovered during TDX
testing.

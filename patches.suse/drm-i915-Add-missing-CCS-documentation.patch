Subject: drm/i915: Add missing CCS documentation
Git-commit: d38d753da7f7c9c4739e3e9ca3c986fa2c1b8c98
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

Let's introduce the basic documentation about CCS.
While doing that, also removed the legacy execution flag name. That flag
simply doesn't exist for CCS and it is not needed on current context
submission. Those flag names are only needed on legacy context,
while on new ones we only need to pass the engine ID.

It is worth mention that this documentation should probably live with
the engine definitions rather than in the i915.rst file directly and
that more updates are likely need in this section. But this should
come later.

v2: Overall improvements from Matt and Tvrtko.

 Intel GPU Basics
 ----------------
 
-An Intel GPU has multiple engines. There are several engine types.
-
-- RCS engine is for rendering 3D and performing compute, this is named
-  `I915_EXEC_RENDER` in user space.
-- BCS is a blitting (copy) engine, this is named `I915_EXEC_BLT` in user
-  space.
-- VCS is a video encode and decode engine, this is named `I915_EXEC_BSD`
-  in user space
-- VECS is video enhancement engine, this is named `I915_EXEC_VEBOX` in user
-  space.
-- The enumeration `I915_EXEC_DEFAULT` does not refer to specific engine;
-  instead it is to be used by user space to specify a default rendering
-  engine (for 3D) that may or may not be the same as RCS.

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: spi: mxic: The interrupt property is not mandatory
Git-commit: 90c204d3195a795f77f5bce767e311dd1c59ca17
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

The interrupt property is not mandatory at all, this property should not
be part of the required properties list, so move it into the optional
properties list.

Fixes: 326e5c8d4a87 ("dt-binding: spi: Document Macronix controller bindings")

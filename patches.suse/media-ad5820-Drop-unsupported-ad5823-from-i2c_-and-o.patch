Subject: [PATCH] media: ad5820: Drop unsupported ad5823 from i2c_ and of_device_id tables
Git-commit: f126ff7e4024f6704e6ec0d4137037568708a3c7
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

The supported ad5820 and ad5821 VCMs both use a single 16 bit register
which is written by sending 2 bytes with the data directly after sending
the i2c-client address.

The ad5823 OTOH has a more typical i2c / smbus device setup with multiple
8 bit registers where the first byte send after the i2c-client address is
the register address and the actual data only starts from the second byte
after the i2c-client address.

The ad5823 i2c_ and of_device_id-s was added at the same time as
the ad5821 ids with as rationale:

"""
Some camera modules also refer that AD5823 is a replacement of AD5820:
https://download.kamami.com/p564094-OV8865_DS.pdf
"""

The AD5823 may be an electrical and functional replacement of the AD5820,
but from a software pov it is not compatible at all and it is going to
need its own driver, drop its id from the ad5820 driver.

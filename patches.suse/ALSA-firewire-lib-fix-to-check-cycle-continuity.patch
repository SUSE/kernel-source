Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: firewire-lib: fix to check cycle continuity
Git-commit: 77ce96543b03f437c6b45f286d8110db2b6622a3
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc7
References: git-fixes

The local helper function to compare the given pair of cycle count
evaluates them. If the left value is less than the right value, the
function returns negative value.

If the safe cycle is less than the current cycle, it is the case of
cycle lost. However, it is not currently handled properly.

This commit fixes the bug.

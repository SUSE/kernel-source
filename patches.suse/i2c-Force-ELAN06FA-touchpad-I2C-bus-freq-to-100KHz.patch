Subject: [PATCH] i2c: Force ELAN06FA touchpad I2C bus freq to 100KHz
Git-commit: bfd74cd1fbc026f04446e67d6915c7e199c2bffd
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: stable-fixes

When a 400KHz freq is used on this model of ELAN touchpad in Linux,
excessive smoothing (similar to when the touchpad's firmware detects
a noisy signal) is sometimes applied. As some devices' (e.g, Lenovo
V15 G4) ACPI tables specify a 400KHz frequency for this device and
some I2C busses (e.g, Designware I2C) default to a 400KHz freq,
force the speed to 100KHz as a workaround.

For future investigation: This problem may be related to the default
HCNT/LCNT values given by some busses' drivers, because they are not
specified in the aforementioned devices' ACPI tables, and because
the device works without issues on Windows at what is expected to be
a 400KHz frequency. The root cause of the issue is not known.

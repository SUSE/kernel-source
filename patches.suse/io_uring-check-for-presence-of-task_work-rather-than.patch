Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: check for presence of task_work rather than
 TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL
Git-commit: 04beb6e0e08c30c6f845f50afb7d7953603d7a6f
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

If some part of the kernel adds task_work that needs executing, in terms
of signaling it'll generally use TWA_SIGNAL or TWA_RESUME. Those two
directly translate to TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL or TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME, and can
be used for a variety of use case outside of task_work.

However, io_cqring_wait_schedule() only tests explicitly for
TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL. This means it can miss if task_work got added for
the task, but used a different kind of signaling mechanism (or none at
all). Normally this doesn't matter as any task_work will be run once
the task exits to userspace, except if:

1) The ring is setup with DEFER_TASKRUN
2) The local work item may generate normal task_work

For condition 2, this can happen when closing a file and it's the final
put of that file, for example. This can cause stalls where a task is
waiting to make progress inside io_cqring_wait(), but there's nothing else
that will wake it up. Hence change the "should we schedule or loop around"
check to check for the presence of task_work explicitly, rather than just
TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL as the mechanism. While in there, also change the
ordering of what type of task_work first in terms of ordering, to both
make it consistent with other task_work runs in io_uring, but also to
better handle the case of defer task_work generating normal task_work,
like in the above example.

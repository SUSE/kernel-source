Subject: scsi: libfc: Don't schedule abort twice
Git-commit: b57c4db5d23b9df0118a25e2441c9288edd73710
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

The current FC error recovery is sending up to three REC (recovery) frames
in 10 second intervals, and as a final step sending an ABTS after 30
seconds for the command itself.  Unfortunately sending an ABTS is also the
action for the SCSI abort handler, and the default timeout for SCSI
commands is also 30 seconds. This causes two ABTS to be scheduled, with the
libfc one slightly earlier. The ABTS scheduled by SCSI EH then sees the
command to be already aborted, and will always return with a 'GOOD' status
irrespective on the actual result from the first ABTS.  This causes the
SCSI EH abort handler to always succeed, and SCSI EH never to be engaged.
Fix this by not issuing an ABTS when a SCSI command is present for the
exchange, but rather wait for the abort scheduled from SCSI EH.  And warn
if an abort is already scheduled to avoid similar errors in the future.

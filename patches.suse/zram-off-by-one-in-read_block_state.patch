Subject: [PATCH] zram: off by one in read_block_state()
Git-commit: a88e03cf3d190cf46bc4063a9b7efe87590de5f4
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

snprintf() returns the number of bytes it would have printed if there
were space.  But it does not count the NUL terminator.  So that means
that if "count == copied" then this has already overflowed by one
character.

This bug likely isn't super harmful in real life.

Subject: [PATCH] HID: apple: disable Fn key handling on the Omoton KB066
Git-commit: 221cea1003d8a412e5ec64a58df7ab19b654f490
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: git-fixes

Remove the fixup to make the Omoton KB066's F6 key F6 when not holding
Fn. That was really just a hack to allow typing F6 in fnmode>0, and it
didn't fix any of the other F keys that were likewise untypable in
fnmode>0. Instead, because the Omoton's Fn key is entirely internal to
the keyboard, completely disable Fn key translation when an Omoton is
detected, which will prevent the hid-apple driver from interfering with
the keyboard's built-in Fn key handling. All of the F keys, including
F6, are then typable when Fn is held.

The Omoton KB066 and the Apple A1255 both have HID product code
05ac:022c. The self-reported name of every original A1255 when they left
the factory was "Apple Wireless Keyboard". By default, Mac OS changes
the name to "<username>'s keyboard" when pairing with the keyboard, but
Mac OS allows the user to set the internal name of Apple keyboards to
anything they like. The Omoton KB066's name, on the other hand, is not
Configurable: It is always "Bluetooth Keyboard". Because that name is so
generic that a user might conceivably use the same name for a real Apple
keyboard, detect Omoton keyboards based on both having that exact name
and having HID product code 022c.

Subject: [PATCH] signal: Add proper comment about the preempt-disable in
 ptrace_stop().

References: SLE Realtime Extension
Git-commit: 0e60a42fa9269e7370d4b439199608dfbfe8bf0f
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1

Commit 53da1d9456fe7 ("fix ptrace slowness") added a preempt-disable section
between read_unlock() and the following schedule() invocation without
explaining why it is needed.

Replace the comment with an explanation why this is needed. Clarify that
it is needed for correctness but for performance reasons.

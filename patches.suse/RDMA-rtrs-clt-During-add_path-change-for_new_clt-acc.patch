Subject: RDMA/rtrs-clt: During add_path change for_new_clt according to
 path_num
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
Git-commit: ac5e8814698c7ceb7188855117b589bc8dd1875e
References: jsc#SLE-19249

When all the paths are removed for a session, the addition of the first
path is like a new session for the storage server.

Hence, for_new_clt has to be set to 1.

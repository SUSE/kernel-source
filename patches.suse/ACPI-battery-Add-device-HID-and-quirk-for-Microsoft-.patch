Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: battery: Add device HID and quirk for Microsoft Surface Go 3
Git-commit: 7dacee0b9efc8bd061f097b1a8d4daa6591af0c6
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

For some reason, the Microsoft Surface Go 3 uses the standard ACPI
interface for battery information, but does not use the standard PNP0C0A
HID. Instead it uses MSHW0146 as identifier. Add that ID to the driver
as this seems to work well.

Additionally, the power state is not updated immediately after the AC
has been (un-)plugged, so add the respective quirk for that.

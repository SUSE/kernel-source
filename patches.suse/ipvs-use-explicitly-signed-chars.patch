Subject: [PATCH] ipvs: use explicitly signed chars
Git-commit: 5c26159c97b324dc5174a5713eafb8c855cf8106
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc4
References: bsc#1207361

The `char` type with no explicit sign is sometimes signed and sometimes
unsigned. This code will break on platforms such as arm, where char is
unsigned. So mark it here as explicitly signed, so that the
todrop_counter decrement and subsequent comparison is correct.

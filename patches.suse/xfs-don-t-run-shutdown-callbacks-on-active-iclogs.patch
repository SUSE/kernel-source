Subject: [PATCH] xfs: don't run shutdown callbacks on active iclogs
Git-commit: 502a01fac0983406e7c312764d7a03e06b3d0748
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1211811

When the log is shutdown, it currently walks all the iclogs and runs
callbacks that are attached to the iclogs, regardless of whether the
iclog is queued for IO completion or not. This creates a problem for
contexts attaching callbacks to iclogs in that a racing shutdown can
run the callbacks even before the attaching context has finished
processing the iclog and releasing it for IO submission.

If the callback processing of the iclog frees the structure that is
attached to the iclog, then this leads to an UAF scenario that can
only be protected against by holding the icloglock from the point
callbacks are attached through to the release of the iclog. While we
currently do this, it is not practical or sustainable.

Hence we need to make shutdown processing the responsibility of the
context that holds active references to the iclog. We know that the
contexts attaching callbacks to the iclog must have active
references to the iclog, and that means they must be in either
ACTIVE or WANT_SYNC states. xlog_state_do_callback() will skip over
iclogs in these states -except- when the log is shut down.

xlog_state_do_callback() checks the state of the iclogs while
holding the icloglock, therefore the reference count/state change
that occurs in xlog_state_release_iclog() after the callbacks are
atomic w.r.t. shutdown processing.

We can't push the responsibility of callback cleanup onto the CIL
context because we can have ACTIVE iclogs that have callbacks
attached that have already been released. Hence we really need to
internalise the cleanup of callbacks into xlog_state_release_iclog()
processing.

Indeed, we already have that internalisation via:

xlog_state_release_iclog
  drop last reference
    ->SYNCING
  xlog_sync
    xlog_write_iclog
      if (log_is_shutdown)
        xlog_state_done_syncing()
	  xlog_state_do_callback()
	    <process shutdown on iclog that is now in SYNCING state>

The problem is that xlog_state_release_iclog() aborts before doing
anything if the log is already shut down. It assumes that the
callbacks have already been cleaned up, and it doesn't need to do
any cleanup.

Hence the fix is to remove the xlog_is_shutdown() check from
xlog_state_release_iclog() so that reference counts are correctly
released from the iclogs, and when the reference count is zero we
always transition to SYNCING if the log is shut down. Hence we'll
always enter the xlog_sync() path in a shutdown and eventually end
up erroring out the iclog IO and running xlog_state_do_callback() to
process the callbacks attached to the iclog.

This allows us to stop processing referenced ACTIVE/WANT_SYNC iclogs
directly in the shutdown code, and in doing so gets rid of the UAF
vector that currently exists. This then decouples the adding of
callbacks to the iclogs from xlog_state_release_iclog() as we
guarantee that xlog_state_release_iclog() will process the callbacks
if the log has been shut down before xlog_state_release_iclog() has
been called.

Subject: net: mana: Annotate struct mana_rxq with __counted_by
Git-commit: a3d7a1209bbb06fe9d24b274475bc9879ca73333
References: git-fixes

Prepare for the coming implementation by GCC and Clang of the __counted_by
attribute. Flexible array members annotated with __counted_by can have
their accesses bounds-checked at run-time checking via CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS
(for array indexing) and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE (for strcpy/memcpy-family
functions).

As found with Coccinelle[1], add __counted_by for struct mana_rxq.

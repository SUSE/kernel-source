Subject: mlx5: stop warning for 64KB pages
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
Git-commit: a5535e5336943b33689f558199366102387b7bbf
References: git-fixes

When building with 64KB pages, clang points out that xsk->chunk_size
can never be PAGE_SIZE:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en/xsk/setup.c:19:22: error: result of comparison of constant 65536 with expression of type 'u16' (aka 'unsigned short') is always false [-Werror,-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare]
        if (xsk->chunk_size > PAGE_SIZE ||
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~

In older versions of this code, using PAGE_SIZE was the only
possibility, so this would have never worked on 64KB page kernels,
but the patch apparently did not address this case completely.

As Maxim Mikityanskiy suggested, 64KB chunks are really not all that
useful, so just shut up the warning by adding a cast.

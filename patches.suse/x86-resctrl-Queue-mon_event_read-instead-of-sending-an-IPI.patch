Subject: x86/resctrl: Queue mon_event_read() instead of sending an IPI
Git-commit: 09909e098113bed99c9f63e1df89073e92c69891
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: jsc#PED-10246

Intel is blessed with an abundance of monitors, one per RMID, that can be
read from any CPU in the domain. MPAMs monitors reside in the MMIO MSC,
the number implemented is up to the manufacturer. This means when there are
fewer monitors than needed, they need to be allocated and freed.

MPAM's CSU monitors are used to back the 'llc_occupancy' monitor file. The
CSU counter is allowed to return 'not ready' for a small number of
micro-seconds after programming. To allow one CSU hardware monitor to be
used for multiple control or monitor groups, the CPU accessing the
monitor needs to be able to block when configuring and reading the
counter.

Worse, the domain may be broken up into slices, and the MMIO accesses
for each slice may need performing from different CPUs.

These two details mean MPAMs monitor code needs to be able to sleep, and
IPI another CPU in the domain to read from a resource that has been sliced.

mon_event_read() already invokes mon_event_count() via IPI, which means
this isn't possible. On systems using nohz-full, some CPUs need to be
interrupted to run kernel work as they otherwise stay in user-space
running realtime workloads. Interrupting these CPUs should be avoided,
and scheduling work on them may never complete.

Change mon_event_read() to pick a housekeeping CPU, (one that is not using
nohz_full) and schedule mon_event_count() and wait. If all the CPUs
in a domain are using nohz-full, then an IPI is used as the fallback.

This function is only used in response to a user-space filesystem request
(not the timing sensitive overflow code).

This allows MPAM to hide the slice behaviour from resctrl, and to keep
the monitor-allocation in monitor.c. When the IPI fallback is used on
machines where MPAM needs to make an access on multiple CPUs, the counter
read will always fail.

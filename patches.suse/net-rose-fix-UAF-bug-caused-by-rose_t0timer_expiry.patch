Subject: [PATCH] net: rose: fix UAF bug caused by rose_t0timer_expiry
Git-commit: 148ca04518070910739dfc4eeda765057856403d
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc6
References: git-fixes

There are UAF bugs caused by rose_t0timer_expiry(). The
root cause is that del_timer() could not stop the timer
handler that is running and there is no synchronization.
One of the race conditions is shown below:

    (thread 1)             |        (thread 2)
                           | rose_device_event
                           |   rose_rt_device_down
                           |     rose_remove_neigh
rose_t0timer_expiry        |       rose_stop_t0timer(rose_neigh)
  ...                      |         del_timer(&neigh->t0timer)
                           |         kfree(rose_neigh) //[1]FREE
  neigh->dce_mode //[2]USE |

The rose_neigh is deallocated in position [1] and use in
position [2].

The crash trace triggered by POC is like below:

Bug: KASAN: use-after-free in expire_timers+0x144/0x320

This patch changes rose_stop_ftimer() and rose_stop_t0timer()
in rose_remove_neigh() to del_timer_sync() in order that the
timer handler could be finished before the resources such as
rose_neigh and so on are deallocated. As a result, the UAF
bugs could be mitigated.

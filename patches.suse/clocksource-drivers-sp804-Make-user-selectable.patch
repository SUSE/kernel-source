Subject: [PATCH] clocksource/drivers:sp804: Make user selectable
Git-commit: 0309f714a0908e947af1c902cf6a330cb593e75e
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

The sp804 is currently only user selectable if COMPILE_TEST, this was
done by commit dfc82faad725 ("clocksource/drivers/sp804: Add
COMPILE_TEST to CONFIG_ARM_TIMER_SP804") in order to avoid it being
spuriously offered on platforms that won't have the hardware since it's
generally only seen on Arm based platforms.  This config is overly
restrictive, while platforms that rely on the SP804 do select it in
their Kconfig there are others such as the Arm fast models which have a
SP804 available but currently unused by Linux.  Relax the dependency to
allow it to be user selectable on arm and arm64 to avoid surprises and
in case someone comes up with a use for extra timer hardware.

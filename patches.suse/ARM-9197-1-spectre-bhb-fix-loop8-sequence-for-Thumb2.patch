Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 9197/1: spectre-bhb: fix loop8 sequence for Thumb2
Git-commit: 3cfb3019979666bdf33a1010147363cf05e0f17b
Patch-mainline: v5.18
References: git-fixes

In Thumb2, 'b . + 4' produces a branch instruction that uses a narrow
encoding, and so it does not jump to the following instruction as
expected. So use W(b) instead.

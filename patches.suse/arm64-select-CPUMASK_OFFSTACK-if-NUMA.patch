Subject: [PATCH 2/3] arm64: select CPUMASK_OFFSTACK if NUMA
Message-ID: <20200223192520.20808-3-aarcange@redhat.com>
References: bsc#1183033, bsc#1183030
Patch-mainline: Submitted, linux-arm ML

It's unclear why normally CPUMASK_OFFSTACK can only be manually
configured "if DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS" which is not an option meant to be
enabled on enterprise arm64 kernels.

The default enterprise kernels NR_CPUS is 4096 which is fairly large.
So it'll save some RAM and it'll increase reliability to select
CPUMASK_OFFSET at least when NUMA is selected and a large NR_CPUS is
to be expected.

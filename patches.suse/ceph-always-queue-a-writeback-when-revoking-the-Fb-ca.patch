Subject: ceph: always queue a writeback when revoking the Fb caps
Git-commit: 902d6d013f75b68f31d208c6f3ff9cdca82648a7
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc5
References: bsc#1226022

In case there is 'Fw' dirty caps and 'CHECK_CAPS_FLUSH' is set we
will always ignore queue a writeback. Queue a writeback is very
important because it will block kclient flushing the snapcaps to
MDS and which will block MDS waiting for revoking the 'Fb' caps.

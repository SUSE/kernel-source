Subject: [PATCH] spi: hisi-kunpeng: Fixed the wrong debugfs node name in hisi_spi debugfs initialization
Git-commit: b062a899c997df7b9ce29c62164888baa7a85833
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc7
References: stable-fixes

In hisi_spi_debugfs_init, spi controller pointer is calculated
by container_of macro, and the member is hs->dev. But the host
cannot be calculated offset directly by this. (hs->dev) points
to (pdev->dev), and it is the (host->dev.parent) rather than
(host->dev) points to the (pdev->dev), which is set in
__spi_alloc_controller.

In this patch, this issues is fixed by getting the spi_controller
data from pdev->dev by dev_get_drvdata() directly. (dev->driver_data)
points to the spi controller data in the probe stage.

Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Force sending delayed status during soft
 disconnect
Git-commit: e1ee843488d58099a89979627ef85d5bd6c5cacd
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1

If any function drivers request for a delayed status phase, this leads to a
SETUP transfer timeout error, since the function may take longer to process
the DATA stage.  This eventually results in end transfer timeouts, as there
is a pending SETUP transaction.

In addition, allow the DWC3_EP_DELAY_STOP to be set for if there is a
delayed status requested.  Ocasionally, a host may abort the current SETUP
transaction, by issuing a subsequent SETUP token.  In those situations, it
would result in an endxfer timeout as well.

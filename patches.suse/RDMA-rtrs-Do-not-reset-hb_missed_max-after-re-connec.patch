Subject: RDMA/rtrs: Do not reset hb_missed_max after re-connection
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
Git-commit: 64bce1ee978491a779eb31098b21c57d4e431d6a
References: jsc#SLE-15176

When re-connecting, it resets hb_missed_max to 0.
Before the first re-connecting, client will trigger re-connection
when it gets hb-ack more than 5 times. But after the first
re-connecting, clients will do re-connection whenever it does
not get hb-ack because hb_missed_max is 0.

There is no need to reset hb_missed_max when re-connecting.
hb_missed_max should be kept until closing the session.

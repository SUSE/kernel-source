Subject: PCI/PM: Avoid putting Elo i2 PCIe Ports in D3cold
Git-commit: 92597f97a40bf661bebceb92e26ff87c76d562d4
Patch-mainline: 5.18
References: git-fixes

If a Root Port on Elo i2 is put into D3cold and then back into D0, the
downstream device becomes permanently inaccessible, so add a bridge D3 DMI
quirk for that system.

This was exposed by 14858dcc3b35 ("PCI: Use pci_update_current_state() in
pci_enable_device_flags()"), but before that commit the Root Port in
question had never been put into D3cold for real due to a mismatch between
its power state retrieved from the PCI_PM_CTRL register (which was
accessible even though the platform firmware indicated that the port was in
D3cold) and the state of an ACPI power resource involved in its power
management.

Subject: x86/boot/32: Disable stackprotector and tracing for
 mk_early_pgtbl_32()
Git-commit: 242db7589460ca94e28c51ffbddd621756f97e11
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

Stackprotector cannot work before paging is enabled. The read from the per
CPU variable __stack_chk_guard is always accessing the virtual address
either directly on UP or via FS on SMP. In physical address mode this
results in an access to memory above 3GB.

So this works by chance as the hardware returns the same value when there
is no RAM at this physical address. When there is RAM populated above 3G
then the read is by chance the same as nothing changes that memory during
the very early boot stage.

Stop relying on pure luck and disable the stack protector for the only C
function which is called during early boot before paging is enabled.

Remove function tracing from the whole source file as there is no way to
trace this at all, but in case of CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE=n
mk_early_pgtbl_32() would access global function tracer variables in
physical address mode which again might work by chance.

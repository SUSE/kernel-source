Subject: drm/i915/uapi: Add kerneldoc for engine class enum
Git-commit: 991b4de3275728fd746ce15e00087fdbd51c29a1
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

We'll be adding a new type of engine soon.  Let's document the existing
engine classes first to help make it clear what each type of engine is
used for.

Subject: [PATCH] HID: wacom: Defer calculation of resolution until resolution_code is known
Git-commit: 1b8f9c1fb464968a5b18d3acc1da8c00bad24fad
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc5
References: git-fixes

The Wacom driver maps the HID_DG_TWIST usage to ABS_Z (rather than ABS_RZ)
for historic reasons. When the code to support twist was introduced in
commit 50066a042da5 ("HID: wacom: generic: Add support for height, tilt,
and twist usages"), we were careful to write it in such a way that it had
HID calculate the resolution of the twist axis assuming ABS_RZ instead
(so that we would get correct angular behavior). This was broken with
the introduction of commit 08a46b4190d3 ("HID: wacom: Set a default
resolution for older tablets"), which moved the resolution calculation
to occur *before* the adjustment from ABS_Z to ABS_RZ occurred.

This commit moves the calculation of resolution after the point that
we are finished setting things up for its proper use.

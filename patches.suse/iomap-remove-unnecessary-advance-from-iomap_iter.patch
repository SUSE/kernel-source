Subject: [PATCH] iomap: remove unnecessary advance from iomap_iter()
Git-commit: 469739f1d8c55dc39939bdb4b558cf875be0ff4e
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14161

At this point, all iomap operations have been updated to advance the
iomap_iter directly before returning to iomap_iter(). Therefore, the
complexity of handling both the old and new semantics is no longer
required and can be removed from iomap_iter().

Update iomap_iter() to expect success or failure status in
iter.processed. As a precaution and developer hint to prevent
inadvertent use of old semantics, warn on a positive return code and
fail the operation. Remove the unnecessary advance and simplify the
termination logic.

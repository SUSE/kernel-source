Subject: net/mlx5: Reload auxiliary drivers on fw_activate
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc4
Git-commit: 34cc6a54914f478c93e176450fae6313404f9f74
References: CVE-2025-39832 bsc#1249901

The devlink reload fw_activate command performs firmware activation
followed by driver reload, while devlink reload driver_reinit triggers
only driver reload. However, the driver reload logic differs between the
two modes, as on driver_reinit mode mlx5 also reloads auxiliary drivers,
while in fw_activate mode the auxiliary drivers are suspended where
applicable.

Additionally, following the cited commit, if the device has multiple PFs,
the behavior during fw_activate may vary between PFs: one PF may suspend
auxiliary drivers, while another reloads them.

Align devlink dev reload fw_activate behavior with devlink dev reload
driver_reinit, to reload all auxiliary drivers.

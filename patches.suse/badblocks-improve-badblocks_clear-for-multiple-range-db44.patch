Subject: [PATCH] badblocks: improve badblocks_clear() for multiple ranges
 handling
Git-commit: db448eb6862979aad2468ecf957a20ef98b82f29
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1174649

With the fundamental ideas and helper routines from badblocks_set()
improvement, clearing bad block for multiple ranges is much simpler.

With a similar idea from badblocks_set() improvement, this patch
simplifies bad block range clearing into 5 situations. No matter how
complicated the clearing condition is, we just look at the head part
of clearing range with relative already set bad block range from the
bad block table. The rested part will be handled in next run of the
while-loop.

Based on existing helpers added from badblocks_set(), this patch adds
two more helpers,
- front_clear()
  Clear the bad block range from bad block table which is front
  overlapped with the clearing range.
- front_splitting_clear()
  Handle the condition that the clearing range hits middle of an
  already set bad block range from bad block table.

Similar as badblocks_set(), the first part of clearing range is handled
with relative bad block range which is find by prev_badblocks(). In most
cases a valid hint is provided to prev_badblocks() to avoid unnecessary
bad block table iteration.

This patch also explains the detail algorithm code comments at beginning
of badblocks.c, including which five simplified situations are
categrized and how all the bad block range clearing conditions are
handled by these five situations.

Again, in order to make the code review easier and avoid the code
changes mixed together, this patch does not modify badblock_clear() and
implement another routine called _badblock_clear() for the improvement.
Later patch will delete current code of badblock_clear() and make it as
a wrapper to _badblock_clear(), so the code change can be much clear for
review.

+ *
+ *
+ * Clearing a bad blocks range from the bad block table has similar idea as
+ * setting does, but much more simpler. The only thing needs to be noticed is
+ * when the clearing range hits middle of a bad block range, the existing bad
+ * block range will split into two, and one more item should be added into the
+ * bad block table. The simplified situations to be considered are, (The already
+ * set bad blocks ranges in bad block table are naming with prefix E, and the
+ * clearing bad blocks range is naming with prefix C)
+ *
+ * 1) A clearing range is not overlapped to any already set ranges in bad block
+ *    table.
+ *    +-----+         |          +-----+         |          +-----+
+ *    |  C  |         |          |  C  |         |          |  C  |
+ *    +-----+         or         +-----+         or         +-----+
+ *            +---+   |   +----+         +----+  |  +---+
+ *            | E |   |   | E1 |         | E2 |  |  | E |
+ *            +---+   |   +----+         +----+  |  +---+
+ *    For the above situations, no bad block to be cleared and no failure
+ *    happens, simply returns 0.
+ * 2) The clearing range hits middle of an already setting bad blocks range in
+ *    the bad block table.
+ *            +---+
+ *            | C |
+ *            +---+
+ *     +-----------------+
+ *     |         E       |
+ *     +-----------------+
+ *    In this situation if the bad block table is not full, the range E will be
+ *    split into two ranges E1 and E2. The result is,
+ *     +------+   +------+
+ *     |  E1  |   |  E2  |
+ *     +------+   +------+
+ * 3) The clearing range starts exactly at same LBA as an already set bad block range
+ *    from the bad block table.
+ * 3.1) Partially covered at head part
+ *         +------------+
+ *         |     C      |
+ *         +------------+
+ *         +-----------------+
+ *         |         E       |
+ *         +-----------------+
+ *    For this situation, the overlapped already set range will update the
+ *    start LBA to end of C and shrink the range to BB_LEN(E) - BB_LEN(C). No
+ *    item deleted from bad block table. The result is,
+ *                      +----+
+ *                      | E1 |
+ *                      +----+
+ * 3.2) Exact fully covered
+ *         +-----------------+
+ *         |         C       |
+ *         +-----------------+
+ *         +-----------------+
+ *         |         E       |
+ *         +-----------------+
+ *    For this situation the whole bad blocks range E will be cleared and its
+ *    corresponded item is deleted from the bad block table.
+ * 4) The clearing range exactly ends at same LBA as an already set bad block
+ *    range.
+ *                   +-------+
+ *                   |   C   |
+ *                   +-------+
+ *         +-----------------+
+ *         |         E       |
+ *         +-----------------+
+ *    For the above situation, the already set range E is updated to shrink its
+ *    end to the start of C, and reduce its length to BB_LEN(E) - BB_LEN(C).
+ *    The result is,
+ *         +---------+
+ *         |    E    |
+ *         +---------+
+ * 5) The clearing range is partially overlapped with an already set bad block
+ *    range from the bad block table.
+ * 5.1) The already set bad block range is front overlapped with the clearing
+ *    range.
+ *         +----------+
+ *         |     C    |
+ *         +----------+
+ *              +------------+
+ *              |      E     |
+ *              +------------+
+ *   For such situation, the clearing range C can be treated as two parts. The
+ *   first part ends at the start LBA of range E, and the second part starts at
+ *   same LBA of range E.
+ *         +----+-----+               +----+   +-----+
+ *         | C1 | C2  |               | C1 |   | C2  |
+ *         +----+-----+         ===>  +----+   +-----+
+ *              +------------+                 +------------+
+ *              |      E     |                 |      E     |
+ *              +------------+                 +------------+
+ *   Now the first part C1 can be handled as condition 1), and the second part C2 can be
+ *   handled as condition 3.1) in next loop.
+ * 5.2) The already set bad block range is behind overlaopped with the clearing
+ *   range.
+ *                 +----------+
+ *                 |     C    |
+ *                 +----------+
+ *         +------------+
+ *         |      E     |
+ *         +------------+
+ *   For such situation, the clearing range C can be treated as two parts. The
+ *   first part C1 ends at same end LBA of range E, and the second part starts
+ *   at end LBA of range E.
+ *                 +----+-----+                 +----+    +-----+
+ *                 | C1 | C2  |                 | C1 |    | C2  |
+ *                 +----+-----+  ===>           +----+    +-----+
+ *         +------------+               +------------+
+ *         |      E     |               |      E     |
+ *         +------------+               +------------+
+ *   Now the first part clearing range C1 can be handled as condition 4), and
+ *   the second part clearing range C2 can be handled as condition 1) in next
+ *   loop.
+ *
+ *   All bad blocks range clearing can be simplified into the above 5 situations
+ *   by only handling the head part of the clearing range in each run of the
+ *   while-loop. The idea is similar to bad blocks range setting but much
+ *   simpler.

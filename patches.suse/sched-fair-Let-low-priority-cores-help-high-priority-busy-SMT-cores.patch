Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Let low-priority cores help high-priority busy
 SMT cores

References: bsc#1212887 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: 18ad34532755feb5b9f4284b07769b1bfec18ab3
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1

Using asym_packing priorities within an SMT core is straightforward. Just
follow the priorities that hardware indicates.

When balancing load from an SMT core, also consider the idle state of its
siblings. Priorities do not reflect that an SMT core divides its throughput
among all its busy siblings. They only makes sense when exactly one sibling
is busy.

Indicate that active balance is needed if the destination CPU has lower
priority than the source CPU but the latter has busy SMT siblings.

Make find_busiest_queue() not skip higher-priority SMT cores with more than
busy sibling.

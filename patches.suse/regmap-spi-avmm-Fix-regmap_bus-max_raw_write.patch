Subject: [PATCH] regmap: spi-avmm: Fix regmap_bus max_raw_write
Git-commit: c8e796895e2310b6130e7577248da1d771431a77
Patch-mainline: v6.4
References: git-fixes

The max_raw_write member of the regmap_spi_avmm_bus structure is defined
As: .max_raw_write = SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE * MAX_WRITE_CNT

SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE == 4 and MAX_WRITE_CNT == 1 so this results in a
maximum write transfer size of 4 bytes which provides only enough space to
transfer the address of the target register. It provides no space for the
value to be transferred. This bug became an issue (divide-by-zero in
_regmap_raw_write()) after the following was accepted into mainline:

commit 3981514180c9 ("regmap: Account for register length when chunking")

Change max_raw_write to include space (4 additional bytes) for both the
register address and value:

	.max_raw_write = SPI_AVMM_REG_SIZE + SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE * MAX_WRITE_CNT

Fixes: 7f9fb67358a2 ("regmap: add Intel SPI Slave to AVMM Bus Bridge support")

A bisect pointed to the breakage beginning with commit 9fee28baa601 ("powerpc:
implement the new page table range API").

Analysis of the oops pointed to a struct page with a corrupted
compound_head being loaded via page_folio() -> _compound_head() in
hash_page_do_lazy_icache().

The access by the mpic code is to an MMIO address, so the expectation
is that the struct page for that address would be initialised by
init_unavailable_range(), as pointed out by Aneesh.

Instrumentation showed that was not the case, which eventually lead to
the realisation that pfn_valid() was returning false for that address,
causing the struct page to not be initialised.

Because the system is using FLATMEM, the version of pfn_valid() in
memory_model.h is used:

static inline int pfn_valid(unsigned long pfn)
{
	...
	return pfn >= pfn_offset && (pfn - pfn_offset) < max_mapnr;
}

Which relies on max_mapnr being initialised. Early in boot max_mapnr is
zero meaning no PFNs are valid.

max_mapnr is initialised in mem_init() called via:

  start_kernel()
    mm_core_init()  # init/main.c:928
      mem_init()

But that is too late for the usage in init_unavailable_range() called via:

  start_kernel()
    setup_arch()    # init/main.c:893
      paging_init()
        free_area_init()
          init_unavailable_range()

Although max_mapnr is currently set in mem_init(), the value is actually
already available much earlier, as soon as mem_topology_setup() has
completed, which is also before paging_init() is called. So move the
initialisation there, which causes paging_init() to correctly initialise
the struct page and fixes the bug.

This bug seems to have been lurking for years, but went unnoticed
because the pre-folio code was inspecting the uninitialised page->flags
but not dereferencing it.

Thanks to Erhard and Aneesh for help debugging.

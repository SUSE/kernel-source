Subject: btrfs: fix unwritten extent buffer after snapshotting a new subvolume
Git-commit: eb96e221937af3c7bb8a63208dbab813ca5d3d7e
Patch-mainline: v6.6
References: bsc#1233319

When creating a snapshot of a subvolume that was created in the current
transaction, we can end up not persisting a dirty extent buffer that is
referenced by the snapshot, resulting in IO errors due to checksum failures
when trying to read the extent buffer later from disk. A sequence of steps
that leads to this is the following:

1) At ioctl.c:create_subvol() we allocate an extent buffer, with logical
   address 36007936, for the leaf/root of a new subvolume that has an ID
   of 291. We mark the extent buffer as dirty, and at this point the
   subvolume tree has a single node/leaf which is also its root (level 0);

2) We no longer commit the transaction used to create the subvolume at
   create_subvol(). We used to, but that was recently removed in
   commit 1b53e51a4a8f ("btrfs: don't commit transaction for every subvol
   create");

3) The transaction used to create the subvolume has an ID of 33, so the
   extent buffer 36007936 has a generation of 33;

4) Several updates happen to subvolume 291 during transaction 33, several
   files created and its tree height changes from 0 to 1, so we end up with
   a new root at level 1 and the extent buffer 36007936 is now a leaf of
   that new root node, which is extent buffer 36048896.

   The commit root remains as 36007936, since we are still at transaction
   33;

5) Creation of a snapshot of subvolume 291, with an ID of 292, starts at
   ioctl.c:create_snapshot(). This triggers a commit of transaction 33 and
   we end up at transaction.c:create_pending_snapshot(), in the critical
   section of a transaction commit.

   There we COW the root of subvolume 291, which is extent buffer 36048896.
   The COW operation returns extent buffer 36048896, since there's no need
   to COW because the extent buffer was created in this transaction and it
   was not written yet.

   The we call btrfs_copy_root() against the root node 36048896. During
   this operation we allocate a new extent buffer to turn into the root
   node of the snapshot, copy the contents of the root node 36048896 into
   this snapshot root extent buffer, set the owner to 292 (the ID of the
   snapshot), etc, and then we call btrfs_inc_ref(). This will create a
   delayed reference for each leaf pointed by the root node with a
   reference root of 292 - this includes a reference for the leaf
   36007936.

   After that we set the bit BTRFS_ROOT_FORCE_COW in the root's state.

   Then we call btrfs_insert_dir_item(), to create the directory entry in
   in the tree of subvolume 291 that points to the snapshot. This ends up
   needing to modify leaf 36007936 to insert the respective directory
   items. Because the bit BTRFS_ROOT_FORCE_COW is set for the root's state,
   we need to COW the leaf. We end up at btrfs_force_cow_block() and then
   at update_ref_for_cow().

   At update_ref_for_cow() we call btrfs_block_can_be_shared() which
   returns false, despite the fact the leaf 36007936 is shared - the
   subvolume's root and the snapshot's root point to that leaf. The
   reason that it incorrectly returns false is because the commit root
   of the subvolume is extent buffer 36007936 - it was the initial root
   of the subvolume when we created it. So btrfs_block_can_be_shared()
   which has the following logic:

   int btrfs_block_can_be_shared(struct btrfs_root *root,
                                 struct extent_buffer *buf)
   {
       if (test_bit(BTRFS_ROOT_SHAREABLE, &root->state) &&
           buf != root->node && buf != root->commit_root &&
           (btrfs_header_generation(buf) <=
            btrfs_root_last_snapshot(&root->root_item) ||
            btrfs_header_flag(buf, BTRFS_HEADER_FLAG_RELOC)))
               return 1;

       return 0;
   }

   Returns false (0) since 'buf' (extent buffer 36007936) matches the
   root's commit root.

   As a result, at update_ref_for_cow(), we don't check for the number
   of references for extent buffer 36007936, we just assume it's not
   shared and therefore that it has only 1 reference, so we set the local
   variable 'refs' to 1.

   Later on, in the final if-else statement at update_ref_for_cow():

   static noinline int update_ref_for_cow(struct btrfs_trans_handle *trans,
                                          struct btrfs_root *root,
                                          struct extent_buffer *buf,
                                          struct extent_buffer *cow,
                                          int *last_ref)
   {
      (...)
      if (refs > 1) {
          (...)
      } else {
          (...)
          btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty(trans, buf);
          *last_ref = 1;
      }
   }

   So we mark the extent buffer 36007936 as not dirty, and as a result
   we don't write it to disk later in the transaction commit, despite the
   fact that the snapshot's root points to it.

   Attempting to access the leaf or dumping the tree for example shows
   that the extent buffer was not written:

   $ btrfs inspect-internal dump-tree -t 292 /dev/sdb
   btrfs-progs v6.2.2
   file tree key (292 ROOT_ITEM 33)

   file data blocks allocated: 65978368

Fix this by updating btrfs_block_can_be_shared() to consider that an
extent buffer may be shared if it matches the commit root and if its
generation matches the current transaction's generation.

This can be reproduced with the following script:

   $ cat test.sh
   #!/bin/bash

   MNT=/mnt/sdi
   DEV=/dev/sdi

   # Use a filesystem with a 64K node size so that we have the same node
   # size on every machine regardless of its page size (on x86_64 default
   # node size is 16K due to the 4K page size, while on PPC it's 64K by
   # default). This way we can make sure we are able to create a btree for
   # the subvolume with a height of 2.
   mkfs.btrfs -f -n 64K $DEV
   mount $DEV $MNT

   btrfs subvolume create $MNT/subvol

   # Create a few empty files on the subvolume, this bumps its btree
   # height to 2 (root node at level 1 and 2 leaves).
   for ((i = 1; i <= 300; i++)); do
       echo -n > $MNT/subvol/file_$i
   done

   btrfs subvolume snapshot -r $MNT/subvol $MNT/subvol/snap

   umount $DEV

   btrfs check $DEV

Running it on a 6.5 kernel (or any 6.6-rc kernel at the moment):

   $ ./test.sh
   Create subvolume '/mnt/sdi/subvol'
   Create a readonly snapshot of '/mnt/sdi/subvol' in '/mnt/sdi/subvol/snap'

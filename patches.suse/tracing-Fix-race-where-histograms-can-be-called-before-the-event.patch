Subject: tracing: Fix race where histograms can be called before the event
Git-commit: ef38c79a522b660f7f71d45dad2d6244bc741841
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc8
References: git-fixes

commit 94eedf3dded5 ("tracing: Fix race where eprobes can be called before
the event") fixed an issue where if an event is soft disabled, and the
trigger is being added, there's a small window where the event sees that
there's a trigger but does not see that it requires reading the event yet,
and then calls the trigger with the record == NULL.

This could be solved with adding memory barriers in the hot path, or to
make sure that all the triggers requiring a record check for NULL. The
latter was chosen.

Commit 94eedf3dded5 set the eprobe trigger handle to check for NULL, but
the same needs to be done with histograms.

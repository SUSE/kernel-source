Subject: drm/ci: skip suspend tests for both msm-sc7180 machines
Git-commit: e3481abc2c625f1085cb9e16f95a7ea7f6dbb9ee
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

The commit ea489a3d983b ("drm/ci: add sc7180-trogdor-kingoftown")
dropped the msm-sc7180-skips.txt file, which disabled suspend-to-RAM
tests. However testing shows that STR tests still can fail. Restore the
skiplist, applying it to both limozeen and kingoftown machines.

Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: Fix more tag iteration function documentation
Git-commit: fea55691aca1edf2fe612fd75536ec26354a8c4a
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14161

Commit 8ab30a331946 ("blk-mq: Drop busy_iter_fn blk_mq_hw_ctx argument")
removed the hctx argument from the callback functions called by
bt_for_each() and blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter(). Commit 2dd6532e9591
("blk-mq: Drop 'reserved' arg of busy_tag_iter_fn") removed the
'reserved' argument of the busy_tag_iter_fn function pointer type. Bring
the documentation of the tag iteration functions in sync with these
changes.

Subject: drm/mipi-dsi: Fix detach call without attach
Git-commit: 90d50b8d85834e73536fdccd5aa913b30494fef0
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

It's been reported that DSI host driver's detach can be called without
the attach ever happening:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230412073954.20601-1-tony@atomide.com/

After reading the code, I think this is what happens:

We have a DSI host defined in the device tree and a DSI peripheral under
that host (i.e. an i2c device using the DSI as data bus doesn't exhibit
this behavior).

The host driver calls mipi_dsi_host_register(), which causes (via a few
functions) mipi_dsi_device_add() to be called for the DSI peripheral. So
now we have a DSI device under the host, but attach hasn't been called.

Normally the probing of the devices continues, and eventually the DSI
peripheral's driver will call mipi_dsi_attach(), attaching the
peripheral.

However, if the host driver's probe encounters an error after calling
mipi_dsi_host_register(), and before the peripheral has called
mipi_dsi_attach(), the host driver will do cleanups and return an error
from its probe function. The cleanups include calling
mipi_dsi_host_unregister().

mipi_dsi_host_unregister() will call two functions for all its DSI
peripheral devices: mipi_dsi_detach() and mipi_dsi_device_unregister().
The latter makes sense, as the device exists, but the former may be
wrong as attach has not necessarily been done.

To fix this, track the attached state of the peripheral, and only detach
from mipi_dsi_host_unregister() if the peripheral was attached.

Note that I have only tested this with a board with an i2c DSI
peripheral, not with a "pure" DSI peripheral.

However, slightly related, the unregister machinery still seems broken.
E.g. if the DSI host driver is unbound, it'll detach and unregister the
DSI peripherals. After that, when the DSI peripheral driver unbound
it'll call detach either directly or using the devm variant, leading to
a crash. And probably the driver will crash if it happens, for some
reason, to try to send a message via the DSI bus.

But that's another topic.

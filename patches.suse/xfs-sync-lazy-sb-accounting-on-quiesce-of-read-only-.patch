Subject: [PATCH] xfs: sync lazy sb accounting on quiesce of read-only mounts
Git-commit: 50d25484bebe94320c49dd1347d3330c7063bbdb
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc1
References: bsc#1190679

xfs_log_sbcount() syncs the superblock specifically to accumulate
the in-core percpu superblock counters and commit them to disk. This
is required to maintain filesystem consistency across quiesce
(freeze, read-only mount/remount) or unmount when lazy superblock
accounting is enabled because individual transactions do not update
the superblock directly.

This mechanism works as expected for writable mounts, but
xfs_log_sbcount() skips the update for read-only mounts. Read-only
mounts otherwise still allow log recovery and write out an unmount
record during log quiesce. If a read-only mount performs log
recovery, it can modify the in-core superblock counters and write an
unmount record when the filesystem unmounts without ever syncing the
in-core counters. This leaves the filesystem with a clean log but in
an inconsistent state with regard to lazy sb counters.

Update xfs_log_sbcount() to use the same logic
xfs_log_unmount_write() uses to determine when to write an unmount
record. This ensures that lazy accounting is always synced before
the log is cleaned. Refactor this logic into a new helper to
distinguish between a writable filesystem and a writable log.
Specifically, the log is writable unless the filesystem is mounted
with the norecovery mount option, the underlying log device is
read-only, or the filesystem is shutdown. Drop the freeze state
check because the update is already allowed during the freezing
process and no context calls this function on an already frozen fs.
Also, retain the shutdown check in xfs_log_unmount_write() to catch
the case where the preceding log force might have triggered a
shutdown.

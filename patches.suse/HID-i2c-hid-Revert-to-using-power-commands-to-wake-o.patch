Subject: [PATCH] HID: i2c-hid: Revert to using power commands to wake on resume
Git-commit: 34851431ceca1bf457d85895bd38a4e7967e2055
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc2
References: git-fixes

commit 7d6f065de37c ("HID: i2c-hid: Use address probe to wake on resume")
replaced the retry of power commands with the dummy read "bus probe" we
use on boot which accounts for a necessary delay before retry.

This made at least one Weida device (2575:0910 in an ASUS Vivobook S14)
very unhappy, as the bus probe despite being successful somehow lead to
the following power command failing so hard that the device never lets
go of the bus. This means that even retries of the power command would
fail on a timeout as the bus remains busy.

Remove the bus probe on resume and instead reintroduce retry of the
power command for wake-up purposes while respecting the newly
established wake-up retry timings.

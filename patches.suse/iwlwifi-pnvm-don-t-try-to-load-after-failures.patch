Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: pnvm: don't try to load after failures
Git-commit: 82a08d0cd7b503be426fb856a0fb73c9c976aae1
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc6
References: bsc#1187495

If loading the PNVM file failed on the first try during the
interface up, the file is unlikely to show up later, and we
already don't try to reload it if it changes, so just don't
try loading it again and again.

This also fixes some issues where we may try to load it at
resume time, which may not be possible yet.

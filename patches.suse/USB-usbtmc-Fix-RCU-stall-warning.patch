usbtmc 3-1:0.0: usb_submit_urb failed: -19

The function usbtmc_interrupt() resubmits urbs when the error status
of an urb is -EPROTO. In systems using the dummy_hcd usb controller
this can result in endless interrupt loops when the usbtmc device is
disconnected from the host system.

Since host controller drivers already try to recover from transmission
errors, there is no need to resubmit the urb or try other solutions
to repair the error situation.

In case of errors the INT pipe just stops to wait for further packets.

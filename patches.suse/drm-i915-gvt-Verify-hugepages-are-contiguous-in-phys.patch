Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/gvt: Verify hugepages are contiguous in physical
 address space

When shadowing a GTT entry with a 2M page, verify that the pfns are
contiguous, not just that the struct page pointers are contiguous.  The
memory map is virtual contiguous if "CONFIG_FLATMEM=y ||
CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=y", but not for "CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y &&
CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n", so theoretically KVMGT could encounter struct
pages that are virtually contiguous, but not physically contiguous.

In practice, this flaw is likely a non-issue as it would cause functional
problems iff a section isn't 2M aligned _and_ is directly adjacent to
another section with discontiguous pfns.

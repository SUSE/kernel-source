Subject: s390/vfio-ap: loop over the shadow APCB when filtering guest's AP
 configuration
Git-commit: 16fb78cbf56e42b8efb2682a4444ab59e32e7959
Patch-mainline: v6.7 or v6.7-rc9 (next release)
References: git-fixes bsc#1219013

While filtering the mdev matrix, it doesn't make sense - and will have
unexpected results - to filter an APID from the matrix if the APID or one
of the associated APQIs is not in the host's AP configuration. There are
two reasons for this:

1. An adapter or domain that is not in the host's AP configuration can be
   assigned to the matrix; this is known as over-provisioning. Queue
   devices, however, are only created for adapters and domains in the
   host's AP configuration, so there will be no queues associated with an
   over-provisioned adapter or domain to filter.

2. The adapter or domain may have been externally removed from the host's
   configuration via an SE or HMC attached to a DPM enabled LPAR. In this
   case, the vfio_ap device driver would have been notified by the AP bus
   via the on_config_changed callback and the adapter or domain would
   have already been filtered.

Since the matrix_mdev->shadow_apcb.apm and matrix_mdev->shadow_apcb.aqm are
copied from the mdev matrix sans the APIDs and APQIs not in the host's AP
configuration, let's loop over those bitmaps instead of those assigned to
the matrix.

Subject: HID: usbhid: Fix warning caused by 0-length input reports
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
Git-commit: 0a824efdb724e07574bafcd2c2486b2a3de35ff6
References: 20210816130059.3yxtdvu2r7wo4uu3@lion.mk-sys.cz 20210819195300.GA8613@rowland.harvard.edu

Syzbot found a warning caused by hid_submit_ctrl() submitting a
control request to transfer a 0-length input report:

	usb 1-1: BOGUS control dir, pipe 80000280 doesn't match bRequestType a1

(The warning message is a little difficult to understand.  It means
that the control request claims to be for an IN transfer but this
contradicts the USB spec, which requires 0-length control transfers
always to be in the OUT direction.)

Now, a zero-length report isn't good for anything and there's no
reason for a device to have one, but the fuzzer likes to pick out
these weird edge cases.  In the future, perhaps we will decide to
reject 0-length reports at probe time.  For now, the simplest approach
for avoiding these warnings is to pretend that the report actually has
length 1.

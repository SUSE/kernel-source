Subject: [PATCH] selftests: forwarding: add shebang for sch_red.sh
Git-commit: 83e4b196838d90799a8879e5054a3beecf9ed256
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc7
References: git-fixes

RHEL/Fedora RPM build checks are stricter, and complain when executable
files don't have a shebang line, e.g.

*** WARNING: ./kselftests/net/forwarding/sch_red.sh is executable but has no shebang, removing executable bit

Fix it by adding shebang line.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: oss: Fix potential deadlock at unregistration
Git-commit: 97d917879d7f92df09c3f21fd54609a8bcd654b2
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

We took sound_oss_mutex around the calls of unregister_sound_special()
at unregistering OSS devices.  This may, however, lead to a deadlock,
because we manage the card release via the card's device object, and
the release may happen at unregister_sound_special() call -- which
will take sound_oss_mutex again in turn.

Although the deadlock might be fixed by relaxing the rawmidi mutex in
the previous commit, it's safer to move unregister_sound_special()
calls themselves out of the sound_oss_mutex, too.  The call is
race-safe as the function has a spinlock protection by itself.

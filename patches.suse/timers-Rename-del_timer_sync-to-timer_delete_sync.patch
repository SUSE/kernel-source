Subject: [PATCH] timers: Rename del_timer_sync() to timer_delete_sync()
Git-commit: 9b13df3fb64ee95e2397585404e442afee2c7d4f
References: bsc#1207210 bsc#1213970
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1

The timer related functions do not have a strict timer_ prefixed namespace
which is really annoying.

Rename del_timer_sync() to timer_delete_sync() and provide del_timer_sync()
as a wrapper. Document that del_timer_sync() is not for new code.

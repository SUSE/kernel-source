Subject: timers: Rename del_timer_sync() to timer_delete_sync()
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
Git-commit: 9b13df3fb64ee95e2397585404e442afee2c7d4f
References: bsc#1213970

The timer related functions do not have a strict timer_ prefixed namespace
which is really annoying.

Rename del_timer_sync() to timer_delete_sync() and provide del_timer_sync()
as a wrapper. Document that del_timer_sync() is not for new code.

SUSE: keep del_timer_sync() in kernel/time/timer.c to not break kABI

Subject: perf/arm-cmn: Workaround AmpereOneX errata AC04_MESH_1 (incorrect
 child count)
Git-commit: 50572064ec7109b00eef8880e905f55861c8b3de
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc5
References: jsc#PED-11433

AmpereOneX mesh implementation has a bug in HN-P nodes that makes them
report incorrect child count. The failing crosspoints report 8 children
while they only have two.

When the driver tries to access the inexistent child nodes, it believes it
has reached an invalid node type and probing fails. The workaround is to
ignore those incorrect child nodes and continue normally.

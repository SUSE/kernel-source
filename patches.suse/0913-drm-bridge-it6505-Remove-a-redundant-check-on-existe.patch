Subject: drm/bridge: it6505: Remove a redundant check on existence of
 bridge->encoder
Git-commit: 8761a39e3f9d9f41a593af2fce1ba41537c35b83
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

In it6505_bridge_attach(), the check on the existence of 'bridge->encoder'
is not necessary, as it has already been checked in the drm_bridge_attach()
which happens prior to it6505_bridge_attach() get called. Note that the
it6505_bridge_attach() will only be called by .attach() of the previous
bridge or KMS driver. The previous drm_bridge_attach() will quit with a
negative error code returned if it fails for some reasons. Hence, it is
guaranteed that the .encoder member of the drm_bridge instance is not NULL
when it6505_bridge_attach() function get called.

Remove the redundant checking codes "if (!bridge->encoder) { ... }".

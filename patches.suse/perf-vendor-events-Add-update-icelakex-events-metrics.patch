Subject: perf vendor events: Add/update icelakex events/metrics
Git-commit: fab88961e2defcdebf4b6c59cc85998c465d587d
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: perf-sp7-v6.11-userspace-update

Update events from v1.24 to v1.26.
Add TMA metrics v4.8.

Bring in the event updates v1.26:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/c607c739e05f2569f95998cc98e1283f042b4fd1
v1.25:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/42d996769069921ec06f6fbb600b0c663b9ec5a9

The TMA 4.8 information was added in:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/59194d4d90ca50a3fcb2de0d82b9f6fc0c9a5736

Adds the event SW_PREFETCH_ACCESS.ANY.

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN1.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN1 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN1 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN1 credit was used.  Note that a single VN1 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN1 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers. : Response (RSP) messages on BL. RSP packets are used to transmit a variety of protocol flits including grants and completions (CMP).",

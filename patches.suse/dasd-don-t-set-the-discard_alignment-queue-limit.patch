Subject: [PATCH] dasd: don't set the discard_alignment queue limit
Git-commit: c3f765299632727fa5ea5a0acf118665227a4f1a
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1183

The discard_alignment queue limit is named a bit misleading means the
offset into the block device at which the discard granularity starts.
Setting it to PAGE_SIZE while the discard granularity is the block size
that is smaller or the same as PAGE_SIZE as done by dasd is mostly
harmless but also useless.

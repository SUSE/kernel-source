Subject: ACPICA: Decrease `AcpiExTracePoint` verbosity
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
Git-commit: ef4af870be41a2a741109b99bbf780c769dcdc30
References: jsc#PED-14260

Early in kernel boot pointers can't be used and so %p shows up
incorrectly:

```
extrace-0138 ex_trace_point        : Method Begin [0x(____ptrval____):\M460] execution.
```

Later in the boot %p works, but it's not really actually useful when
the pathname can resolve properly.

Adjust the debug print so that if the Pathname resolves that the pointer
isn't also printed:

```
extrace-0138 ex_trace_point        : Method Begin [\M460] execution.
```

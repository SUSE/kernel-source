Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: Fix problem of COMMIT and NFS4ERR_DELAY in infinite
 loop
Git-commit: 147abcacee33781e75588869e944ddb07528a897
Patch-mainline: v6.4
References: git-fixes

The following request sequence to the same file causes the NFS client and
server getting into an infinite loop with COMMIT and NFS4ERR_DELAY:

OPEN
REMOVE
WRITE
COMMIT

Problem reported by recall11, recall12, recall14, recall20, recall22,
recall40, recall42, recall48, recall50 of nfstest suite.

This patch restores the handling of race condition in nfsd_file_do_acquire
with unlink to that prior of the regression.

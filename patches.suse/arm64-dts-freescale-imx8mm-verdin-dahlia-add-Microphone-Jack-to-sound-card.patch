Subject: arm64: dts: freescale: imx8mm-verdin-dahlia: add Microphone Jack to
 sound card
Git-commit: 2c1092823eb03f8508d6769e2f38eef7e1fe62a0
Patch-mainline: v6.14 or v6.14-rc8 (next release)
References: git-fixes

The simple-audio-card's microphone widget currently connects to the
headphone jack. Routing the microphone input to the microphone jack
allows for independent operation of the microphone and headphones.

This resolves the following boot-time kernel log message, which
indicated a conflict when the microphone and headphone functions were
not separated:
  debugfs: File 'Headphone Jack' in directory 'dapm' already present!

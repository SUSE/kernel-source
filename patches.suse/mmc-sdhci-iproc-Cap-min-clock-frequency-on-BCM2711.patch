Subject: mmc: sdhci-iproc: Cap min clock frequency on BCM2711
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc7
Git-commit: c9107dd0b851777d7e134420baf13a5c5343bc16
References: bsc#1186009

There is a known bug on BCM2711's SDHCI core integration where the
controller will hang when the difference between the core clock and the
bus clock is too great. Specifically this can be reproduced under the
following conditions:

- No SD card plugged in, polling thread is running, probing cards at
  100KHz.
- BCM2711's core clock configured at 500MHz or more.

So set 200MHz as the minimum clock frequency available for that board.

For more information on the issue see this:

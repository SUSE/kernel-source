Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: ep0: Don't prepare beyond Setup stage
Git-commit: c96683798e272366866a5c0ce3073c0b5a256db7
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1

Since we can't guarantee that the host won't send new Setup packet
before going through the device-initiated disconnect, don't prepare
beyond the Setup stage and keep the device in EP0_SETUP_PHASE. This
ensures that the device-initated disconnect sequence can go through
gracefully. Note that the controller won't service the End Transfer
command if it can't DMA out the Setup packet.

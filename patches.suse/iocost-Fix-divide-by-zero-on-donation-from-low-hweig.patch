Subject: [PATCH] iocost: Fix divide-by-zero on donation from low hweight
 cgroup
Git-commit: edaa26334c117a584add6053f48d63a988d25a6e
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc6
References: bsc#1198014 CVE-2021-47584 bsc#1226564

The donation calculation logic assumes that the donor has non-zero
after-donation hweight, so the lowest active hweight a donating cgroup can
have is 2 so that it can donate 1 while keeping the other 1 for itself.
Earlier, we only donated from cgroups with sizable surpluses so this
condition was always true. However, with the precise donation algorithm
implemented, f1de2439ec43 ("blk-iocost: revamp donation amount
determination") made the donation amount calculation exact enabling even low
hweight cgroups to donate.

This means that in rare occasions, a cgroup with active hweight of 1 can
enter donation calculation triggering the following warning and then a
divide-by-zero oops.

 iocg: invalid donation weights in /a/b: active=1 donating=1 after=0

Fix it by excluding cgroups w/ active hweight < 2 from donating. Excluding
these extreme low hweight donations shouldn't affect work conservation in
any meaningful way.

Subject: ipc/sem: Fix dangling sem_array access in semtimedop race
Git-commit: b52be557e24c47286738276121177a41f54e3b83
Patch-mainline: v6.1
References: bsc#1234727

When __do_semtimedop() goes to sleep because it has to wait for a
semaphore value becoming zero or becoming bigger than some threshold, it
links the on-stack sem_queue to the sem_array, then goes to sleep
without holding a reference on the sem_array.

When __do_semtimedop() comes back out of sleep, one of two things must
happen:

 a) We prove that the on-stack sem_queue has been disconnected from the
    (possibly freed) sem_array, making it safe to return from the stack
    frame that the sem_queue exists in.

 b) We stabilize our reference to the sem_array, lock the sem_array, and
    detach the sem_queue from the sem_array ourselves.

sem_array has RCU lifetime, so for case (b), the reference can be
stabilized inside an RCU read-side critical section by locklessly
checking whether the sem_queue is still connected to the sem_array.

However, the current code does the lockless check on sem_queue before
starting an RCU read-side critical section, so the result of the
lockless check immediately becomes useless.

Fix it by doing rcu_read_lock() before the lockless check.  Now RCU
ensures that if we observe the object being on our queue, the object
can't be freed until rcu_read_unlock().

This bug is only hittable on kernel builds with full preemption support
(either CONFIG_PREEMPT or PREEMPT_DYNAMIC with preempt=full).

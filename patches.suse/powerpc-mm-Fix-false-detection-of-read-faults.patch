Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/mm: Fix false detection of read faults
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Patch-mainline: submitted http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/patch/20230310050834.63105-1-ruscur@russell.cc/
References: bsc#1208864

To support detection of read faults with Radix execute-only memory, the
vma_is_accessible() check in access_error() (which checks for PROT_NONE)
was replaced with a check to see if VM_READ was missing, and if so,
returns true to assert the fault was caused by a bad read.

This is incorrect, as it ignores that both VM_WRITE and VM_EXEC imply
read on powerpc, as defined in protection_map[].  This causes mappings
containing VM_WRITE or VM_EXEC without VM_READ to misreport the cause of
page faults, since the MMU is still allowing reads.

Correct this by restoring the original vma_is_accessible() check for
PROT_NONE mappings, and adding a separate check for Radix PROT_EXEC-only
mappings.

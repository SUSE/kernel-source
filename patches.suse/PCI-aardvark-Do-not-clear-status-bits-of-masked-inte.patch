Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Do not clear status bits of masked interrupts
Mime-version: 1.0

Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

The PCIE_ISR1_REG says which interrupts are currently set / active,
including those which are masked.

The driver currently reads this register and looks if some unmasked
interrupts are active, and if not, it clears status bits of _all_
interrupts, including the masked ones.

This is incorrect, since, for example, some drivers may poll these bits.

Remove this clearing, and also remove this early return statement
completely, since it does not change functionality in any way.

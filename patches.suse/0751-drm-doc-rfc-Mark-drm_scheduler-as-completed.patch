Subject: drm/doc/rfc: Mark drm_scheduler as completed
Git-commit: 0e2e6c49c1c072dff841d9dfab3b4966abb2edf1
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

Current drm-xe-next doesn't have any drm/scheduler patch that is not
already accepted in drm-misc-next. This completed this goal with
the consensus of how the drm/scheduler fits to the fw scheduling and
the relationship between drm_gpu_scheduler and drm_sched_entity.

-Xe primarily uses Firmware based scheduling (GuC FW). However, it will use
-drm_scheduler as the scheduler ‘frontend’ for userspace submission in order to

-not yet prepared to handle the 1-to-1 relationship between drm_gpu_scheduler and

-Deeper changes to drm_scheduler should *not* be required to get Xe accepted, but
-some consensus needs to be reached between Xe and other community drivers that
-could also benefit from this work, for coupling FW based/assisted submission such
-as the ARM’s new Mali GPU driver, and others.
-
-As a key measurable result, the patch series introducing Xe itself shall not

-through drm-misc. This, by itself, already includes the reach of an agreement for

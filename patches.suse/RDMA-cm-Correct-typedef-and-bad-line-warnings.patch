Subject: [PATCH 1/1] RDMA/cm: Correct typedef and bad line warnings
Git-commit: 4e5cba5bb6f37ceaba6a2628a171cbede02f969c
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-15314

In include/rdma/ib_cm.h:

Correct a typedef's kernel-doc notation by adding the 'typedef' keyword
to it to avoid a warning.
Add a leading " *" to a kernel-doc line to avoid a warning.

Warning: ib_cm.h:289 function parameter 'ib_cm_handler' not described
 in 'int'
Warning: ib_cm.h:289 expecting prototype for ib_cm_handler().  Prototype
 was for int() instead
Warning: ib_cm.h:484 bad line: connection message in case duplicates
 are received.

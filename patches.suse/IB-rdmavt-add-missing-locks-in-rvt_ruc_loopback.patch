Subject: [PATCH 1/1] IB/rdmavt: add missing locks in rvt_ruc_loopback
Git-commit: 22cbc6c2681a0a4fe76150270426e763d52353a4
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

The documentation of the function rvt_error_qp says both r_lock and
s_lock need to be held when calling that function.
It also asserts using lockdep that both of those locks are held.
rvt_error_qp is called form rvt_send_cq, which is called from
rvt_qp_complete_swqe, which is called from rvt_send_complete, which is
called from rvt_ruc_loopback in two places. Both of these places do not
hold r_lock. Fix this by acquiring a spin_lock of r_lock in both of
these places.
The r_lock acquiring cannot be added in rvt_qp_complete_swqe because
some of its other callers already have r_lock acquired.

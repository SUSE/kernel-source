Subject: drm/panel: simple: Add a comment about unprepare+disable at
 shutdown/remove
Git-commit: bc62654df3c888dec735343f5db9907ac93aea60
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

It's the responsibility of a correctly written DRM modeset driver to
call drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() at shutdown time and that should be
disabling / unpreparing the panel if needed. Panel drivers shouldn't
be calling these functions themselves.

A recent effort was made to fix as many DRM modeset drivers as
possible [1] [2] [3] and most drivers are fixed now.

Unfortunately, it's very difficult to know exactly which DRM modeset
drivers are using panel-simple due to the sheer number of panels it
handles. For now, we'll leave the calls and just add a comment to keep
people from copying this code.

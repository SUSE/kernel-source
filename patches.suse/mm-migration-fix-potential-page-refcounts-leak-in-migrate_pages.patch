Subject: mm/migration: fix potential page refcounts leak in migrate_pages
Git-commit: 69a041ff505806c95b24b8d5cab43e66aacd91e6
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1247

In -ENOMEM case, there might be some subpages of fail-to-migrate THPs left
in thp_split_pages list.  We should move them back to migration list so
that they could be put back to the right list by the caller otherwise the
page refcnt will be leaked here.  Also adjust nr_failed and nr_thp_failed
accordingly to make vm events account more accurate.

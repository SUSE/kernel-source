Subject: net/mlx5: Fix fw tracer first block check
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc7
Git-commit: 4261edf11cb7c9224af713a102e5616329306932
References: jsc#PED-3311

While handling new traces, to verify it is not the first block being
written, last_timestamp is checked. But instead of checking it is non
zero it is verified to be zero. Fix to verify last_timestamp is not
zero.

Subject: page_pool: fix &page_pool_params kdoc issues
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc2
Git-commit: 266aa3b4812e97942a8ce5c7aafa7da059f7b5b8
References: jsc#PED-11221

After the tagged commit, @netdev got documented twice and the kdoc
script didn't notice that. Remove the second description added later
and move the initial one according to the field position.

After merging commit 5f8e4007c10d ("kernel-doc: fix
struct_group_tagged() parsing"), kdoc requires to describe struct
groups as well. &page_pool_params has 2 struct groups which
generated new warnings, describe them to resolve this.

Fixes: 403f11ac9ab7 ("page_pool: don't use driver-set flags field directly")

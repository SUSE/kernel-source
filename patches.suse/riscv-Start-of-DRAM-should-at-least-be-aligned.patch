Subject: [PATCH] riscv: Start of DRAM should at least be aligned on PMD size
 for the direct mapping
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.11
Git-commit: c3bcc65d4d2e8292c435322cbc34c318d06b8b6c

commit c3bcc65d4d2e8292c435322cbc34c318d06b8b6c upstream.

So that we do not end up mapping the whole linear mapping using 4K
pages, which is slow at boot time, and also very likely at runtime.

So make sure we align the start of DRAM on a PMD boundary.

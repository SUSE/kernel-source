It was reported that ideapad-laptop sometimes causes some recent (since
2024) Lenovo ThinkBook models shut down when:
 - suspending/resuming
 - closing/opening the lid
 - (dis)connecting a charger
 - reading/writing some sysfs properties, e.g., fan_mode, touchpad
 - pressing down some Fn keys, e.g., Brightness Up/Down (Fn+F5/F6)
 - (seldom) loading the kmod

The issue has existed since the launch day of such models, and there
have been some out-of-tree workarounds (see Link:) for the issue. One
disables some functionalities, while another one simply shortens
IDEAPAD_EC_TIMEOUT. The disabled functionalities have read_ec_data() in
their call chains, which calls schedule() between each poll.

It turns out that these models suffer from the indeterminacy of
schedule() because of their low tolerance for being polled too
frequently. Sometimes schedule() returns too soon due to the lack of
ready tasks, causing the margin between two polls to be too short.
In this case, the command is somehow aborted, and too many subsequent
polls (they poll for "nothing!") may eventually break the state machine
in the EC, resulting in a hard shutdown. This explains why shortening
IDEAPAD_EC_TIMEOUT works around the issue - it reduces the total number
of polls sent to the EC.

Even when it doesn't lead to a shutdown, frequent polls may also disturb
the ongoing operation and notably delay (+ 10-20ms) the availability of
EC response. This phenomenon is unlikely to be exclusive to the models
mentioned above, so dropping the schedule() manner should also slightly
improve the responsiveness of various models.

Fix these issues by migrating to usleep_range(150, 300). The interval is
chosen to add some margin to the minimal 50us and considering EC
responses are usually available after 150-2500us based on my test. It
should be enough to fix these issues on all models subject to the EC bug
without introducing latency on other models.

Tested on ThinkBook 14 G7+ ASP and solved both issues. No regression was
introduced in the test on a model without the EC bug (ThinkBook X IMH,
thanks Eric).

Subject: [PATCH] batman-adv: Trigger events for auto adjusted MTU
Git-commit: c6a953cce8d0438391e6da48c8d0793d3fbfcfa6
Patch-mainline: v6.5
References: git-fixes

If an interface changes the MTU, it is expected that an NETDEV_PRECHANGEMTU
and NETDEV_CHANGEMTU notification events is triggered. This worked fine for
.ndo_change_mtu based changes because core networking code took care of it.
But for auto-adjustments after hard-interfaces changes, these events were
simply missing.

Due to this problem, non-batman-adv components weren't aware of MTU changes
and thus couldn't perform their own tasks correctly.

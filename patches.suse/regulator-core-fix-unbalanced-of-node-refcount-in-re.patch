Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: fix unbalanced of node refcount in regulator_dev_lookup()
Git-commit: f2b41b748c19962b82709d9f23c6b2b0ce9d2f91
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

I got the the following report:

  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,
  of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:
  attach overlay node /i2c/pmic@62/regulators/exten

In of_get_regulator(), the node is returned from of_parse_phandle()
with refcount incremented, after using it, of_node_put() need be called.

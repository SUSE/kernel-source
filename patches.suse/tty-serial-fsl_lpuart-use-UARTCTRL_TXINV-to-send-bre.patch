Subject: [PATCH] tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: use UARTCTRL_TXINV to send break instead of UARTCTRL_SBK
Git-commit: 2474e05467c00f7d51af3039b664de6886325257
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc5
References: git-fixes

LPUART IP now has two known bugs, one is that CTS has higher priority
than the break signal, which causes the break signal sending through
UARTCTRL_SBK may impacted by the CTS input if the HW flow control is
enabled. It exists on all platforms we support in this driver.
So we add a workaround patch for this issue: commit c4c81db5cf8b
("tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: disable the CTS when send break signal").

Another IP bug is i.MX8QM LPUART may have an additional break character
being sent after SBK was cleared. It may need to add some delay between
clearing SBK and re-enabling CTS to ensure that the SBK latch are
completely cleared.

But we found that during the delay period before CTS is enabled, there
is still a risk that Bluetooth data in TX FIFO may be sent out during
this period because of break off and CTS disabled(even if BT sets CTS
line deasserted, data is still sent to BT).

Due to this risk, we have to drop the CTS-disabling workaround for SBK
bugs, use TXINV seems to be a better way to replace SBK feature and
avoid above risk. Also need to disable the transmitter to prevent any
data from being sent out during break, then invert the TX line to send
break. Then disable the TXINV when turn off break and re-enable
transmitter.

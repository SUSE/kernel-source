Subject: [PATCH] Revert "drm/xe/xe2: Enable Indirect Ring State support for Xe2"

This reverts commit fe0154cf8222d9e38c60ccc124adb2f9b5272371.

Seeing some unexplained random failures during LRC context switches with
indirect ring state enabled. The failures were always there, but the
repro rate increased with the addition of WA BB as a separate BO.
Commit 3a1edef8f4b5 ("drm/xe: Make WA BB part of LRC BO") helped to
reduce the issues in the context switches, but didn't eliminate them
completely.

Indirect ring state is not required for any current features, so disable
for now until failures can be root caused.

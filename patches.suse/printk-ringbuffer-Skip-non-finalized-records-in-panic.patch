Subject: printk: ringbuffer: Skip non-finalized records in panic
Git-commit: b1c4c67a5e90db8fbdb5b5504fe16e17b564cca8
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1223574

Normally a reader will stop once reaching a non-finalized
record. However, when a panic happens, writers from other CPUs
(or an interrupted context on the panic CPU) may have been
writing a record and were unable to finalize it. The panic CPU
will reserve/commit/finalize its panic records, but these will
be located after the non-finalized records. This results in
panic() not flushing the panic messages.

Extend _prb_read_valid() to skip over non-finalized records if
on the panic CPU.

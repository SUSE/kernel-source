Subject: [PATCH] staging: rtl8192e: Fix W_DISABLE# does not work after stop/start
Git-commit: 3fac2397f562eb669ddc2f45867a253f3fc26184
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

When loading the driver for rtl8192e, the W_DISABLE# switch is working as
intended. But when the WLAN is turned off in software and then turned on
again the W_DISABLE# does not work anymore. Reason for this is that in
the function _rtl92e_dm_check_rf_ctrl_gpio() the bfirst_after_down is
checked and returned when true. bfirst_after_down is set true when
switching the WLAN off in software. But it is not set to false again
when WLAN is turned on again.

Add bfirst_after_down = false in _rtl92e_sta_up to reset bit and fix
above described bug.

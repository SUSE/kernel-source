Subject: perf tests: test_arm_coresight: Simplify source iteration
Git-commit: 0b783d2e82d827af73c779e8e8f95d07e992b451
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: perf-v6.7 (jsc#PED-6012 jsc#PED-6121)

There are two reasons to do this, firstly there is a shellcheck warning
in cs_etm_dev_name(), which can be completely deleted. And secondly the
current iteration method doesn't support systems with both ETE and ETM
because it picks one or the other. There isn't a known system with this
configuration, but it could happen in the future.

Iterating over all the sources for each CPU can be done by going through
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cs_etm/cpu* and following the symlink back
to the Coresight device in /sys/bus/coresight/devices. This will work
whether the device is ETE, ETM or any future name, and is much simpler
and doesn't require any hard coded version numbers

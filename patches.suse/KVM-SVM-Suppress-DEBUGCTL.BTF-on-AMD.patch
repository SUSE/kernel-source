Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Suppress DEBUGCTL.BTF on AMD

Mark BTF as reserved in DEBUGCTL on AMD, as KVM doesn't actually support
BTF, and fully enabling BTF virtualization is non-trivial due to
interactions with the emulator, guest_debug, #DB interception, nested SVM,
etc.

Don't inject #GP if the guest attempts to set BTF, as there's no way to
communicate lack of support to the guest, and instead suppress the flag
and treat the WRMSR as (partially) unsupported.

In short, make KVM behave the same on AMD and Intel (VMX already squashes
BTF).

Note, due to other bugs in KVM's handling of DEBUGCTL, the only way BTF
has "worked" in any capacity is if the guest simultaneously enables LBRs.

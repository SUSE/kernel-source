Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: fix provided buffer import
Git-commit: 09007af2b627f0f195c6c53c4829b285cc3990ec
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc5
References: bsc#1205205

io_import_iovec uses the s pointer, but this was changed immediately
after the iovec was re-imported and so it was imported into the wrong
place.

Change the ordering.

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: revert "xfs: actually bump warning counts when we send
 warnings"
Git-commit: bc37e4fb5cac2925b2e286b1f1d4fc2b519f7d92
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 4b8628d57b725b32616965e66975fcdebe008fe7.

XFS quota has had the concept of a "quota warning limit" since
the earliest Irix implementation, but a mechanism for incrementing
the warning counter was never implemented, as documented in the
xfs_quota(8) man page. We do know from the historical archive that
it was never incremented at runtime during quota reservation
operations.

With this commit, the warning counter quickly increments for every
allocation attempt after the user has crossed a quote soft
limit threshold, and this in turn transitions the user to hard
quota failures, rendering soft quota thresholds and timers useless.
This was reported as a regression by users.

Because the intended behavior of this warning counter has never been
understood or documented, and the result of this change is a regression
in soft quota functionality, revert this commit to make soft quota
limits and timers operable again.

Subject: bpf: Force checkpoint when jmp history is too long
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc6
Git-commit: aa30eb3260b2dea3a68d3c42a39f9a09c5e99cee
References: jsc#PED-11651

A specifically crafted program might trick verifier into growing very
long jump history within a single bpf_verifier_state instance.
Very long jump history makes mark_chain_precision() unreasonably slow,
especially in case if verifier processes a loop.

Mitigate this by forcing new state in is_state_visited() in case if
current state's jump history is too long.

Use same constant as in `skip_inf_loop_check`, but multiply it by
arbitrarily chosen value 2 to account for jump history containing not
only information about jumps, but also information about stack access.

For an example of problematic program consider the code below,
w/o this patch the example is processed by verifier for ~15 minutes,
before failing to allocate big-enough chunk for jmp_history.

    0: r7 = *(u16 *)(r1 +0);"
    1: r7 += 0x1ab064b9;"
    2: if r7 & 0x702000 goto 1b;
    3: r7 &= 0x1ee60e;"
    4: r7 += r1;"
    5: if r7 s> 0x37d2 goto +0;"
    6: r0 = 0;"
    7: exit;"

Perf profiling shows that most of the time is spent in
mark_chain_precision() ~95%.

The easiest way to explain why this program causes problems is to
apply the following patch:

    BPF program is too large. Processed 257 insn

The log output shows that checkpoint at label (1) is never created,
because it is suppressed by `skip_inf_loop_check` logic:
a. When 'if' at (2) is processed it pushes a state with insn_idx (1)
   onto stack and proceeds to (3);
b. At (5) checkpoint is created, and this resets
   env->{jmps,insns}_processed.
c. Verification proceeds and reaches `exit`;
d. State saved at step (a) is popped from stack and is_state_visited()
   considers if checkpoint needs to be added, but because
   env->{jmps,insns}_processed had been just reset at step (b)
   the `skip_inf_loop_check` logic forces `add_new_state` to false.
e. Verifier proceeds with current state, which slowly accumulates
   more and more entries in the jump history.

The accumulation of entries in the jump history is a problem because
of two factors:
- it eventually exhausts memory available for kmalloc() allocation;
- mark_chain_precision() traverses the jump history of a state,
  meaning that if `r7` is marked precise, verifier would iterate
  ever growing jump history until parent state boundary is reached.

(note: the log also shows a REG INVARIANTS VIOLATION warning
       upon jset processing, but that's another bug to fix).

With this patch applied, the example above is rejected by verifier
under 1s of time, reaching 1M instructions limit.

The program is a simplified reproducer from syzbot report.
Previous discussion could be found at [1].
The patch does not cause any changes in verification performance,
when tested on selftests from veristat.cfg and cilium programs taken
from [2].

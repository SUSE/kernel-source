Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Do not include __READ_ONCE() block in assembly files
Git-commit: 52c9f93a9c482251cb0d224faa602ba26d462be8
Patch-mainline: v5.17
References: git-fixes

When building arm64 defconfig + CONFIG_LTO_CLANG_{FULL,THIN}=y after
commit 558c303c9734 ("arm64: Mitigate spectre style branch history side
channels"), the following error occurs:

  <instantiation>:4:2: error: invalid fixup for movz/movk instruction
   mov w0, #ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3
   ^

Marc figured out that moving "#include <linux/init.h>" in
include/linux/arm-smccc.h into a !__ASSEMBLY__ block resolves it. The
full include chain with CONFIG_LTO=y from include/linux/arm-smccc.h:

include/linux/init.h
include/linux/compiler.h
arch/arm64/include/asm/rwonce.h
arch/arm64/include/asm/alternative-macros.h
arch/arm64/include/asm/assembler.h

The asm/alternative-macros.h include in asm/rwonce.h only happens when
CONFIG_LTO is set, which ultimately casues asm/assembler.h to be
included before the definition of ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3. As a
result, the preprocessor does not expand ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3 in
__mitigate_spectre_bhb_fw, which results in the error above.

Avoid this problem by just avoiding the CONFIG_LTO=y __READ_ONCE() block
in asm/rwonce.h with assembly files, as nothing in that block is useful
to assembly files, which allows ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3 to be
properly expanded with CONFIG_LTO=y builds.

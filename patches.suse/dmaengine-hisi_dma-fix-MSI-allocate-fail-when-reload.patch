Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: hisi_dma: fix MSI allocate fail when reload hisi_dma
Git-commit: b95044b38425f563404234d96bbb20cc6360c7e1
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Remove the loaded hisi_dma driver and reload it, the driver fails
to work properly. The following error is reported in the kernel log:

[ 1475.597609] hisi_dma 0000:7b:00.0: Failed to allocate MSI vectors!
[ 1475.604915] hisi_dma: probe of 0000:7b:00.0 failed with error -28

As noted in "The MSI Driver Guide HOWTO"[1], the number of MSI
interrupt must be a power of two. The Kunpeng DMA driver allocates 30
MSI interrupts. As a result, no space left on device is reported
when the driver is reloaded and allocates interrupt vectors from the
interrupt domain.

This patch changes the number of interrupt vectors allocated by
hisi_dma driver to 32 to avoid this problem.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: do not output error message if a qgroup has been
 already cleaned up

[BUG]
There is a bug report that btrfs outputs the following error message:

  BTRFS info (device nvme0n1p2): qgroup scan completed (inconsistency flag cleared)
  BTRFS warning (device nvme0n1p2): failed to cleanup qgroup 0/1179: -2

[CAUSE]
The error itself is pretty harmless, and the end user should ignore it.

When a subvolume is fully dropped, btrfs will call
btrfs_qgroup_cleanup_dropped_subvolume() to delete the qgroup.

However if a qgroup rescan happened before a subvolume fully dropped,
qgroup for that subvolume will not be re-created, as rescan will only
create new qgroup if there is a BTRFS_ROOT_REF_KEY found.

But before we drop a subvolume, the subvolume is unlinked thus there is no
BTRFS_ROOT_REF_KEY.

In that case, btrfs_remove_qgroup() will fail with -ENOENT and trigger
the above error message.

[FIX]
Just ignore -ENOENT error from btrfs_remove_qgroup() inside
btrfs_qgroup_cleanup_dropped_subvolume().

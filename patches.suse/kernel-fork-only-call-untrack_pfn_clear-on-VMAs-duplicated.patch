Subject: kernel/fork: only call untrack_pfn_clear() on VMAs duplicated for
 fork()
Git-commit: e9f180d7cfde23b9f8eebd60272465176373ab2c
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc7
References: git-fix for CVE-2025-22090 bsc#1241537

Not intuitive, but vm_area_dup() located in kernel/fork.c is not only used
for duplicating VMAs during fork(), but also for duplicating VMAs when
splitting VMAs or when mremap()'ing them.

VM_PFNMAP mappings can at least get ordinarily mremap()'ed (no change in
size) and apparently also shrunk during mremap(), which implies
duplicating the VMA in __split_vma() first.

In case of ordinary mremap() (no change in size), we first duplicate the
VMA in copy_vma_and_data()->copy_vma() to then call untrack_pfn_clear() on
the old VMA: we effectively move the VM_PAT reservation.  So the
untrack_pfn_clear() call on the new VMA duplicating is wrong in that
context.

Splitting of VMAs seems problematic, because we don't duplicate/adjust the
reservation when splitting the VMA.  Instead, in memtype_erase() -- called
during zapping/munmap -- we shrink a reservation in case only the end
address matches: Assume we split a VMA into A and B, both would share a
reservation until B is unmapped.

So when unmapping B, the reservation would be updated to cover only A.
When unmapping A, we would properly remove the now-shrunk reservation.
That scenario describes the mremap() shrinking (old_size > new_size),
where we split + unmap B, and the untrack_pfn_clear() on the new VMA when
is wrong.

What if we manage to split a VM_PFNMAP VMA into A and B and unmap A first?
It would be broken because we would never free the reservation.  Likely,
there are ways to trigger such a VMA split outside of mremap().

Affecting other VMA duplication was not intended, vm_area_dup() being used
outside of kernel/fork.c was an oversight.  So let's fix that for; how to
handle VMA splits better should be investigated separately.


With a simple reproducer that uses mprotect() to split such a VMA I can
trigger

x86/PAT: pat_mremap:26448 freeing invalid memtype [mem 0x00000000-0x00000fff]

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: clear flags before allowing to retune
Git-commit: 77347eda64ed5c9383961d1de9165f9d0b7d8df6
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

It might be that something goes wrong during tuning so the MMC core will
immediately trigger a retune. In our case it was:

 - we sent a tuning block
 - there was an error so we need to send an abort cmd to the eMMC
 - the abort cmd had a CRC error
 - retune was set by the MMC core

This lead to a vicious circle causing a performance regression of 75%.
So, clear retuning flags before we enable retuning to start with a known
cleared state.

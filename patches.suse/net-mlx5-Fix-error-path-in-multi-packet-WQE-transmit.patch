Subject: net/mlx5: Fix error path in multi-packet WQE transmit
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc2
Git-commit: 2bcae12c795f32ddfbf8c80d1b5f1d3286341c32
References: CVE-2024-50001 bsc#1232084

Remove the erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was established

The multi-packet WQE transmit code attempts to obtain a DMA mapping for
the skb. This could fail, e.g. under memory pressure, when the IOMMU
driver just can't allocate more memory for page tables. While the code
tries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneously
unmaps one entry from the sq's FIFO list of active mappings. Since the
current map attempt failed this unmap is removing some random DMA mapping
that might still be required. If the PCI function now presents that IOVA,
the IOMMU may assumes a rogue DMA access and e.g. on s390 puts the PCI
function in error state.

The erroneous behavior was seen in a stress-test environment that created
memory pressure.

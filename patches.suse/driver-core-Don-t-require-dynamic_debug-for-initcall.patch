Subject: [PATCH] driver core: Don't require dynamic_debug for initcall_debug probe timing
Git-commit: e2f06aa885081e1391916367f53bad984714b4db
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

Don't require the use of dynamic debug (or modification of the kernel to
add a #define DEBUG to the top of this file) to get the printk message
about driver probe timing. This printk is only emitted when
initcall_debug is enabled on the kernel commandline, and it isn't
immediately obvious that you have to do something else to debug boot
timing issues related to driver probe. Add a comment too so it doesn't
get converted back to pr_debug().

Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: keep multishot request NAPI timeout current
Git-commit: 2c762be5b798c443612c1bb9b011de4fdaebd1c5
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc2
References: bsc#1230569

This refresh statement was originally present in the original patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20221121191437.996297-2-shr@devkernel.io/

It has been removed with no explanation in v6:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20230201222254.744422-2-shr@devkernel.io/

It is important to make the refresh for multishot requests, because if no
new requests using the same NAPI device are added to the ring, the entry
will become stale and be removed silently. The unsuspecting user will
not know that their ring had busy polling for only 60 seconds before
being pruned.

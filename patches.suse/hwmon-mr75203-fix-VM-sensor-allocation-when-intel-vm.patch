Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (mr75203) fix VM sensor allocation when "intel,vm-map" not defined
Git-commit: 81114fc3d27bf5b06b2137d2fd2b63da656a8b90
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc5
References: git-fixes

Bug - in case "intel,vm-map" is missing in device-tree ,'num' is set
to 0, and no voltage channel infos are allocated.

The reason num is set to 0 when "intel,vm-map" is missing is to set the
entire pvt->vm_idx[] with incremental channel numbers, but it didn't
take into consideration that same num is used later in devm_kcalloc().

If "intel,vm-map" does exist there is no need to set the unspecified
channels with incremental numbers, because the unspecified channels
can't be accessed in pvt_read_in() which is the only other place besides
the probe functions that uses pvt->vm_idx[].

This change fixes the bug by moving the incremental channel numbers
setting to be done only if "intel,vm-map" property is defined (starting
loop from 0), and removing 'num = 0'.

While fuzzing an arm64 kernel, Alexander Potapenko reported:

This is a false positive data race between a seqcount latch writer and a reader
accessing stale data. Since its introduction, KCSAN has never understood the
seqcount_latch interface (due to being unannotated).

Unlike the regular seqlock interface, the seqcount_latch interface for latch
writers never has had a well-defined critical section, making it difficult to
teach tooling where the critical section starts and ends.

Introduce an instrumentable (non-raw) seqcount_latch interface, with
which we can clearly denote writer critical sections. This both helps
readability and tooling like KCSAN to understand when the writer is done
updating all latch copies.

Subject: [PATCH] misc: fastrpc: Mark all sessions as invalid in cb_remove
Git-commit: a4e61de63e34860c36a71d1a364edba16fb6203b
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc3
References: git-fixes

In remoteproc shutdown sequence, rpmsg_remove will get called which
would depopulate all the child nodes that have been created during
rpmsg_probe. This would result in cb_remove call for all the context
banks for the remoteproc. In cb_remove function, session 0 is
getting skipped which is not correct as session 0 will never become
available again. Add changes to mark session 0 also as invalid.

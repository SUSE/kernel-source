Subject: tracing/synthetic: Fix order of struct trace_dynamic_info
Git-commit: fc52a64416b010c8324e2cb50070faae868521c1
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc2
References: git-fixes

To make handling BIG and LITTLE endian better the offset/len of dynamic
fields of the synthetic events was changed into a structure of:

 struct trace_dynamic_info {
 #ifdef CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
	u16	offset;
	u16	len;
 #else
	u16	len;
	u16	offset;
 #endif
 };

to replace the manual changes of:

 data_offset = offset & 0xffff;
 data_offest = len << 16;

But if you look closely, the above is:

  <len> << 16 | offset

Which in little endian would be in memory:

 offset_lo offset_hi len_lo len_hi

and in big endian:

 len_hi len_lo offset_hi offset_lo

Which if broken into a structure would be:

 struct trace_dynamic_info {
 #ifdef CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
	u16	len;
	u16	offset;
 #else
	u16	offset;
	u16	len;
 #endif
 };

Which is the opposite of what was defined.

Fix this and just to be safe also add "__packed".

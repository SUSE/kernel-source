Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: fix data missing when reusing bh which is ready to be
 checkpointed
Git-commit: e6b9bd7290d334451ce054e98e752abc055e0034
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: bsc#1213095

Following process will make data lost and could lead to a filesystem
corrupted problem:

1. jh(bh) is inserted into T1->t_checkpoint_list, bh is dirty, and
   jh->b_transaction = NULL
2. T1 is added into journal->j_checkpoint_transactions.
3. Get bh prepare to write while doing checkpoing:
           PA				    PB
   do_get_write_access             jbd2_log_do_checkpoint
    spin_lock(&jh->b_state_lock)
     if (buffer_dirty(bh))
      clear_buffer_dirty(bh)   // clear buffer dirty
       set_buffer_jbddirty(bh)
				    transaction =
				    journal->j_checkpoint_transactions
				    jh = transaction->t_checkpoint_list
				    if (!buffer_dirty(bh))
		                      __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint(jh)
				      // bh won't be flushed
		                    jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail
    __jbd2_journal_file_buffer(jh, transaction, BJ_Reserved)
4. Aborting journal/Power-cut before writing latest bh on journal area.

In this way we get a corrupted filesystem with bh's data lost.

Fix it by moving the clearing of buffer_dirty bit just before the call
to __jbd2_journal_file_buffer(), both bit clearing and jh->b_transaction
assignment are under journal->j_list_lock locked, so that
jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() will wait until jh's new transaction fininshed
even bh is currently not dirty. And journal_shrink_one_cp_list() won't
remove jh from checkpoint list if the buffer head is reused in
do_get_write_access().

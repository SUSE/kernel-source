Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/pmu: Fix type length error when reading
 pmu->fixed_ctr_ctrl

Use a u64 instead of a u8 when taking a snapshot of pmu->fixed_ctr_ctrl
when reprogramming fixed counters, as truncating the value results in KVM
thinking fixed counter 2 is already disabled (the bug also affects fixed
counters 3+, but KVM doesn't yet support those).  As a result, if the
guest disables fixed counter 2, KVM will get a false negative and fail to
reprogram/disable emulation of the counter, which can leads to incorrect
counts and spurious PMIs in the guest.

Fixes: 76d287b2342e ("KVM: x86/pmu: Drop "u8 ctrl, int idx" for reprogram_fixed_counter()")

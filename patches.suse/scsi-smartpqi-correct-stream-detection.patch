Subject: scsi: smartpqi: correct stream detection
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
Git-commit: 4c76114932d1d6fad2e72823e7898a3c960cf2a7
References: jsc#PED-11377

Correct stream detection by initializing the structure
pqi_scsi_dev_raid_map_data to 0s.

When the OS issues SCSI READ commands, the driver erroneously considers
them as SCSI WRITES. If they are identified as sequential IOs, the driver
then submits those requests via the RAID path instead of the AIO path.

The 'is_write' flag might be set for SCSI READ commands also.  The driver
may interpret SCSI READ commands as SCSI WRITE commands, resulting in IOs
being submitted through the RAID path.

Note: This does not cause data corruption.

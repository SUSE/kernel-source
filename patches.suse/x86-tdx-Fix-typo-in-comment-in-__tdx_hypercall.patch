Subject: x86/tdx: Fix typo in comment in __tdx_hypercall()
Git-commit: 3543f8830babe2666051fb239545f51e0aae4c84
References: bsc#1206453

Comment in __tdx_hypercall() points that RAX==0 indicates TDVMCALL
failure which is opposite of the truth: RAX==0 is success.

Fix the comment. No functional changes.

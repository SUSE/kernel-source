Subject: x86/hyperv: Block root partition functionality in a Confidential VM
Git-commit: f8acb24aaf89fc46cd953229462ea8abe31b395f
References: git-fixes

Hyper-V should never specify a VM that is a Confidential VM and also
running in the root partition.  Nonetheless, explicitly block such a
combination to guard against a compromised Hyper-V maliciously trying to
exploit root partition functionality in a Confidential VM to expose
Confidential VM secrets. No known bug is being fixed, but the attack
surface for Confidential VMs on Hyper-V is reduced.

Subject: [PATCH] can: bittiming: fix documentation for struct can_tdc
Git-commit: 8345a330738149389dc8883573c9264965922e08
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

This patch fixes a typo in the documentation for struct can_tdc::tdcv.
The number "0" refers to automatic mode not the letter "O".

Further two grammar errors in the documentation for struct can_tdc are
fixed.

First grammar error: add a missing third person 's'.

Second grammar error: replace "such as" by "such that". The intent is
to give a condition, not an example.

Fixes: 289ea9e4ae59 ("can: add new CAN FD bittiming parameters: Transmitter Delay Compensation (TDC)")

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: Fixup support for writeback-cache for eMMC and SD
Git-commit: 08ebf903af57cda6d773f3dd1671b64f73b432b8
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc2
References: git-fixes

During the card initialization process, the mmc core checks whether the
eMMC/SD card supports an internal writeback-cache and then enables it
inside the card.

Unfortunately, this isn't according to what the mmc core reports to the
upper block layer. Instead, the writeback-cache support with REQ_FLUSH and
REQ_FUA, are being enabled depending on whether the host supports the CMD23
(MMC_CAP_CMD23) and whether an eMMC supports the reliable-write command.

This is wrong and it may also sound awkward. In fact, it's a remnant
from when both eMMC/SD cards didn't have dedicated commands/support to
control the internal writeback-cache. In other words, it was the best we
could do at that point in time.

To fix the problem, but also without breaking backwards compatibility,
let's align the REQ_FLUSH support with whether the writeback-cache became
successfully enabled - for both eMMC and SD cards.

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Fix definitions of reserved bits
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 12998087d9f48b66965b97412069c7826502cd7e
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

Some bits in PCI_EXP registers are reserved for non-root ports. Driver
pci-bridge-emul.c implements PCIe Root Port device therefore it should not
allow setting reserved bits of registers.

Properly define non-reserved bits for all PCI_EXP registers.

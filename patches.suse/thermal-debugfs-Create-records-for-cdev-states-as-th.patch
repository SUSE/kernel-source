Subject: thermal/debugfs: Create records for cdev states as they get used
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
Git-commit: f4ae18fcb652c6cccc834ded525ac37f91d5cdb1
References: jsc#PED-11164

Because thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() only creates a duration record
for the old state of a cooling device, if its new state is used for the
first time, there will be no record for it and cdev_dt_seq_show() will
not print the duration information for it even though it contains code
to compute the duration value in that case.

Address this by making thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() create a
duration record for the new state if there is none.

Subject: scsi: lpfc: Change diagnostic log flag during receipt of unknown ELS
 cmds
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
Git-commit: 5b8963c53de11dcef2b6241452988427db5773ec
References: bsc#1229429

During diagnostics, it has been determined that the 0115 log message for
receipt of unknown ELS cmds does not benefit from trace buffer dumps.  The
trace buffer dump floods the console with unnecessary information, and the
singular LOG_ELS flag has proven more beneficial in debugging efforts when
dealing with unknown ELS cmds.

Subject: arm64: proton-pack: Expose whether the platform is mitigated by
 firmware
References: bsc#1242778
Git-commit: e7956c92f396a44eeeb6eaf7a5b5e1ad24db6748
Patch-mainline: v6.15

is_spectre_bhb_fw_affected() allows the caller to determine if the CPU
is known to need a firmware mitigation. CPUs are either on the list
of CPUs we know about, or firmware has been queried and reported that
the platform is affected - and mitigated by firmware.

This helper is not useful to determine if the platform is mitigated
by firmware. A CPU could be on the know list, but the firmware may
not be implemented. Its affected but not mitigated.

spectre_bhb_enable_mitigation() handles this distinction by checking
the firmware state before enabling the mitigation.

Add a helper to expose this state. This will be used by the BPF JIT
to determine if calling firmware for a mitigation is necessary and
supported.

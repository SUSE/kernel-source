Subject: [PATCH] selftests/ir: fix build with ancient kernel headers
Git-commit: 183f80fd72db42c9cc483aa7a5e8e881355d0b03
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc4
References: git-fixes

Since commit e2bcbd7769ee ("tools headers UAPI: remove stale lirc.h"),
the build of the selftests fails on rhel 8 since its version of
/usr/include/linux/lirc.h has no definition of RC_PROTO_RCMM32, etc [1].

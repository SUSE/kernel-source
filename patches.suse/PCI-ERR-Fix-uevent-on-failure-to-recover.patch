Subject: [PATCH] PCI/ERR: Fix uevent on failure to recover
Git-commit: 1cbc5e25fb70e942a7a735a1f3d6dd391afc9b29
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Upon failure to recover from a PCIe error through AER, DPC or EDR, a
uevent is sent to inform user space about disconnection of the bridge
whose subordinate devices failed to recover.

However the bridge itself is not disconnected.  Instead, a uevent should
be sent for each of the subordinate devices.

Only if the "bridge" happens to be a Root Complex Event Collector or
Integrated Endpoint does it make sense to send a uevent for it (because
there are no subordinate devices).

Right now if there is a mix of subordinate devices with and without
pci_error_handlers, a BEGIN_RECOVERY event is sent for those with
pci_error_handlers but no FAILED_RECOVERY event is ever sent for them
afterwards.  Fix it.

Fixes: 856e1eb9bdd4 ("PCI/AER: Add uevents in AER and EEH error/resume")

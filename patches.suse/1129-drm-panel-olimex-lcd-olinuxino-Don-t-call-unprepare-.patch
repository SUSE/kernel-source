Subject: drm/panel: olimex-lcd-olinuxino: Don't call unprepare+disable at
 remove
Git-commit: 16661a0dd54168826edb2fe5a7b9a183cff0c69b
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

It's the responsibility of a correctly written DRM modeset driver to
call drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() at shutdown time and that should be
disabling / unpreparing the panel if needed. Panel drivers shouldn't
be calling these functions themselves.

A recent effort was made to fix as many DRM modeset drivers as
possible [1] [2] [3] and most drivers are fixed now.

Unfortunately, grepping mainline for this panel's compatible string
shows no hits, so we can't be 100% sure if the DRM modeset driver used
with this panel has been fixed. If it is found that the DRM modeset
driver hasn't been fixed then this patch could be temporarily reverted
until it is.

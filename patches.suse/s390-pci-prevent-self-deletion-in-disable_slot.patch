Subject: s390/pci: Prevent self deletion in disable_slot()
Git-commit: 47c397844869ad0e6738afb5879c7492f4691122
Patch-mainline: v6.15 or v6.15-rc8 (next release)
References: LTC#213760 bsc#1244147 git-fixes

As disable_slot() takes a struct zpci_dev from the Configured to the
Standby state. In Standby there is still a hotplug slot so this is not
usually a case of sysfs self deletion. This is important because self
deletion gets very hairy in terms of locking (see for example
recover_store() in arch/s390/pci/pci_sysfs.c).

Because the pci_dev_put() is not within the critical section of the
zdev->state_lock however, disable_slot() can turn into a case of self
deletion if zPCI device event handling slips between the mutex_unlock()
and the pci_dev_put(). If the latter is the last put and
zpci_release_device() is called this then tries to remove the hotplug
slot via zpci_exit_slot() which will try to remove the hotplug slot
directory the disable_slot() is part of i.e. self deletion.

Prevent this by widening the zdev->state_lock critical section to
include the pci_dev_put() which is then guaranteed to happen with the
struct zpci_dev still in Standby state ensuring it will not lead to
a zpci_release_device() call as at least the zPCI event handling code
still holds a reference.

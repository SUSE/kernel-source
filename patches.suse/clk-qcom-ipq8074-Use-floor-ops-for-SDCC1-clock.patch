Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: ipq8074: Use floor ops for SDCC1 clock
Git-commit: b77d8306d84f83d1da68028a68c91da9c867b6f6
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Use floor ops on SDCC1 APPS clock in order to round down selected clock
frequency and avoid overclocking SD/eMMC cards.

For example, currently HS200 cards were failling tuning as they were
actually being clocked at 384MHz instead of 192MHz.
This caused some boards to disable 1.8V I/O and force the eMMC into the
standard HS mode (50MHz) and that appeared to work despite the eMMC being
overclocked to 96Mhz in that case.

There was a previous commit to use floor ops on SDCC clocks, but it looks
to have only covered SDCC2 clock.

Subject: x86/microcode: Add per CPU control field
Git-commit: ba3aeb97cb2c53025356f31c5a0a294385194115
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

Add a per CPU control field to ucode_ctrl and define constants for it
which are going to be used to control the loading state machine.

In theory this could be a global control field, but a global control does
not cover the following case:

 15 primary CPUs load microcode successfully
  1 primary CPU fails and returns with an error code

With global control the sibling of the failed CPU would either try again or
the whole operation would be aborted with the consequence that the 15
siblings do not invoke the apply path and end up with inconsistent software
state. The result in dmesg would be inconsistent too.

There are two additional fields added and initialized:

ctrl_cpu and secondaries. ctrl_cpu is the CPU number of the primary thread
for now, but with the upcoming uniform loading at package or system scope
this will be one CPU per package or just one CPU. Secondaries hands the
control CPU a CPU mask which will be required to release the secondary CPUs
out of the wait loop.

Preparatory change for implementing a properly split control flow for
primary and secondary CPUs.

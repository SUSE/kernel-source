Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Ignore EP queue requests during bus reset
Git-commit: 71ca43f30df9c642970f9dc9b2d6f463f4967e7b
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

The current dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt() will stop any active
transfers, but only addresses blocking of EP queuing for while we are
coming from a disconnected scenario, i.e. after receiving the disconnect
event.  If the host decides to issue a bus reset on the device, the
connected parameter will still be set to true, allowing for EP queuing
to continue while we are disabling the functions.  To avoid this, set the
connected flag to false until the stop active transfers is complete.

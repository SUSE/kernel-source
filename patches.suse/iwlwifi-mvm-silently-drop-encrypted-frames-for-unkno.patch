Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: mvm: silently drop encrypted frames for unknown station
Git-commit: 3df5c0ddcf81f2fe2d6a5e48efc3a37aa0feda5b
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-19360

When a station is removed, the driver-mac80211 station mapping is removed
before the station is actually deleted from the FW. As a result, it is
reasonable that the FW will continue to pass frames although the driver
doesn't have a station for them anymore. Thus change the message
severity level from ERR to DEBUG_DROP.

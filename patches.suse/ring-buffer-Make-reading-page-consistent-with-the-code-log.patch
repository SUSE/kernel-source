Subject: ring-buffer: Make reading page consistent with the code logic
Git-commit: 6e31b759b076eebb4184117234f0c4eb9e4bc460
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

In the loop of __rb_map_vma(), the 's' variable is calculated from the
same logic that nr_pages is and they both come from nr_subbufs. But the
relationship is not obvious and there's a WARN_ON_ONCE() around the 's'
variable to make sure it never becomes equal to nr_subbufs within the
loop. If that happens, then the code is buggy and needs to be fixed.

The 'page' variable is calculated from cpu_buffer->subbuf_ids[s] which is
an array of 'nr_subbufs' entries. If the code becomes buggy and 's'
becomes equal to or greater than 'nr_subbufs' then this will be an out of
bounds hit before the WARN_ON() is triggered and the code exiting safely.

Make the 'page' initialization consistent with the code logic and assign
it after the out of bounds check.

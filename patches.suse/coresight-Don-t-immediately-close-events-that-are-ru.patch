Subject: coresight: Don't immediately close events that are run on invalid
 CPU/sink combos

Git-commit: 8c60acbcb982bfff14d1e85094474671c4f3d006
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-19046

When a traced process runs on a CPU that can't reach the selected sink,
the event will be stopped with PERF_HES_STOPPED. This means that even if
the process migrates to a valid CPU, tracing will not resume.

This can be reproduced (on N1SDP) by using taskset to start the process
on CPU 0, and then switching it to CPU 2 (ETF 1 is only reachable from
CPU 2):

  taskset --cpu-list 0 ./perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etf1/ --per-thread -- taskset --cpu-list 2 ls

This produces a single 0 length AUX record, and then no more trace:

  0x3c8 [0x30]: PERF_RECORD_AUX offset: 0 size: 0 flags: 0x1 [T]

After the fix, the same command produces normal AUX records. The perf
self test "89: Check Arm CoreSight trace data recording and synthesized
samples" no longer fails intermittently. This was because the taskset in
the test is after the fork, so there is a period where the task is
scheduled on a random CPU rather than forced to a valid one.

Specifically selecting an invalid CPU will still result in a failure to
open the event because it will never produce trace:

  ./perf record -C 2 -e cs_etm/@tmc_etf0/
  failed to mmap with 12 (Cannot allocate memory)

The only scenario that has changed is if the CPU mask has a valid CPU
sink combo in it.

Testing
=======

* Coresight self test passes consistently:
  ./perf test Coresight

* CPU wide mode still produces trace:
  ./perf record -e cs_etm// -a

* Invalid -C options still fail to open:
  ./perf record -C 2,3 -e cs_etm/@tmc_etf0/
  failed to mmap with 12 (Cannot allocate memory)

* Migrating a task to a valid sink/CPU now produces trace:
  taskset --cpu-list 0 ./perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etf1/ --per-thread -- taskset --cpu-list 2 ls

* If the task remains on an invalid CPU, no trace is emitted:
  taskset --cpu-list 0 ./perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etf1/ --per-thread -- ls

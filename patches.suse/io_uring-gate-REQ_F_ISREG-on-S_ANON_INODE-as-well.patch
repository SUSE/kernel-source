Subject: io_uring: gate REQ_F_ISREG on !S_ANON_INODE as well
Git-commit: 6f11adcc6f36ffd8f33dbdf5f5ce073368975bc3
Git-repo: https://git.kernel.dk/cgit/linux#io_uring-6.16
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: io_uring-regression

io_uring marks a request as dealing with a regular file on S_ISREG. This
drives things like retries on short reads or writes, which is generally
not expected on a regular file (or bdev). Applications tend to not
expect that, so io_uring tries hard to ensure it doesn't deliver short
IO on regular files.

However, a recent commit added S_IFREG to anonymous inodes. When
io_uring is used to read from various things that are backed by anon
inodes, like eventfd, timerfd, etc, then it'll now all of a sudden wait
for more data when rather than deliver what was read or written in a
single operation. This breaks applications that issue reads on anon
inodes, if they ask for more data than a single read delivers.

Add a check for !S_ANON_INODE as well before setting REQ_F_ISREG to
prevent that.

Subject: perf vendor events arm64: Update V1 events using Arm telemetry repo
Git-commit: a484e64580bdb792ad613ee45bc36efd24f77191
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: perf-v6.7 (jsc#PED-6012 jsc#PED-6121)

The new data [1] includes descriptions that may have product specific
details and new groupings that will be consistent with other products.

The following command was used to generate the jsons:

 $ telemetry-solution/tools/perf_json_generator/generate.py \
   linux/tools/perf/ --telemetry-files \
   telemetry-solution/data/pmu/cpu/neoverse/neoverse-v1.json

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: run delayed iputs when flushing delalloc
Git-commit: 2d3447261031503b181dacc549fe65ffe2d93d65
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc6
References: git-fixes

We have transient failures with btrfs/301, specifically in the part
where we do

  for i in $(seq 0 10); do
	  write 50m to file
	  rm -f file
  done

Sometimes this will result in a transient quota error, and it's because
sometimes we start writeback on the file which results in a delayed
iput, and thus the rm doesn't actually clean the file up.  When we're
flushing the quota space we need to run the delayed iputs to make sure
all the unlinks that we think have completed have actually completed.
This removes the small window where we could fail to find enough space
in our quota.

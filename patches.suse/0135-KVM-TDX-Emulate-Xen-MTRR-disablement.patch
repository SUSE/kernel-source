Subject: [PATCH 135/155] KVM: TDX: Emulate Xen MTRR disablement

The TDX module doesn't allow VMM to disable CPUID.MTRR
(CPUID[EAX=1].EDX[12]) bit.  It forcibly sets the bit to 1(MTRR available)
unconditionally and VMM can't change it.  The v6.5 guest kernel doesn't
disable MTRR explicitly.  It uses CPUID.MTRR and results in a kernel panic
when setting CR4.CD=1 to disable cache during programming MTRRs.

The guest kernel has Xen MTRR disablement.
  Commit f9626104a5b6 ("x86/mm/mtrr: Generalize runtime disabling of MTRRs")
When MTRR is available and MTRRdefType.enable = 0 as BIOS hand-off state,
the kernel pretends as MTRR isn't available.  That is a deviation from SDM
because MTRRdefType.enable = 0 means all memory access is UC according to
the SDM.

Mimic the Xen guest MTRR disablement for the TD guest kernel to boot.

Other workaround is to pass "clearcpuid=mtrr" to the guest kernel command
line.

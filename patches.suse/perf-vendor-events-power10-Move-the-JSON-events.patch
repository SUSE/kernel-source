This can be divided by PM_L2_TLBIE_SLBIE_SENT to obtain the average time a TLBIE/SLBIEG/SLBIAG command was held. Event count should be multiplied by 2 since the data is coming from a 2:1 clock domain and the data is time sliced across all 4 threads."

Multiply this count by 1000 to obtain the total number of cycles. This can be divided by PM_L2_SNP_TLBIE_SLBIE_START to obtain the overall efficiency. Note: 'inflight' means SnpTLB has been sent to core(ie doesn't include when SnpTLB is in NCU waiting to be launched serially behind different SnpTLB). The NCU Snooper gets in a 'hottemp' delay window when it detects it is above its TLBIE/SLBIE threshold for process SnpTLBIE/SLBIE with this core. Event count should be multiplied by 2 since the data is coming from a 2:1 clock domain and the data is time sliced across all 4 threads."

Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: hci_qca: Set BDA quirk bit if fwnode exists in DT
Git-commit: 7dcd3e014aa7faeeaf4047190b22d8a19a0db696
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc7
References: jsc#PED-10412

BT adapter going into UNCONFIGURED state during BT turn ON when
devicetree has no local-bd-address node.

Bluetooth will not work out of the box on such devices, to avoid this
problem, added check to set HCI_QUIRK_USE_BDADDR_PROPERTY based on
local-bd-address node entry.

When this quirk is not set, the public Bluetooth address read by host
from controller though HCI Read BD Address command is
considered as valid.

Fixes: e668eb1e1578 ("Bluetooth: hci_core: Don't stop BT if the BD address missing in dts")

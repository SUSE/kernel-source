Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: tscs454: Add endianness flag in snd_soc_component_driver
Git-commit: ff69ec96b87dccb3a29edef8cec5d4fefbbc2055
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

The endianness flag is used on the CODEC side to specify an
ambivalence to endian, typically because it is lost over the hardware
link. This device receives audio over an I2S DAI and as such should
have endianness applied.

A fixup is also required to use the width directly rather than relying
on the format in hw_params, now both little and big endian would be
supported. It is worth noting this changes the behaviour of S24_LE to
use a word length of 24 rather than 32. This would appear to be a
correction since the fact S24_LE is stored as 32 bits should not be
presented over the bus.

Subject: drm/amdgpu: add a retry for IP discovery init
Git-commit: 3938eb956e383ef88b8fc7d556492336ebee52df
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

AMD dGPUs have integrated FW that runs as soon as the
device gets power and initializes the board (determines
the amount of memory, provides configuration details to
the driver, etc.).  For direct PCIe attached cards this
happens as soon as power is applied and normally completes
well before the OS has even started loading.  However, with
hotpluggable ports like USB4, the driver needs to wait for
this to complete before initializing the device.

This normally takes 60-100ms, but could take longer on
some older boards periodically due to memory training.

Retry for up to a second.  In the non-hotplug case, there
should be no change in behavior and this should complete
on the first try.

v2: adjust test criteria
v3: adjust checks for the masks, only enable on removable devices
v4: skip bif_fb_en check

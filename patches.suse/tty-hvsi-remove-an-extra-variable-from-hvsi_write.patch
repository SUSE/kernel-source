Subject: [PATCH] tty: hvsi: remove an extra variable from hvsi_write()

References: bsc#1232534 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
Git-commit: d3352ab0a9701a6d4c88b814815d7320c339f4a8

'source' is the same as 'buf'. Rename the parameter ('buf') to
'source' and drop the local variable.

Likely, the two were introduced to have a different type. But 'char' and
'unsigned char' are the same in the kernel for a long time.

Subject: [PATCH] HID: add USB_HID dependancy on some USB HID drivers
Git-commit: f237d9028f844a86955fc9da59d7ac4a5c55d7d5
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc5
References: CVE-2022-20132 bsc#1200619

Some HID drivers are only for USB drivers, yet did not depend on
CONFIG_USB_HID.  This was hidden by the fact that the USB functions were
stubbed out in the past, but now that drivers are checking for USB
devices properly, build errors can occur with some random
configurations.

Subject: [PATCH] cifs: open_cached_dir should not rely on primary channel
Git-commit: 936eba9cfb5cfbf6a2c762cd163605f2b784e03e
References: bsc#1231432
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1

open_cached_dir today selects ses->server a.k.a primary channel
to send requests. When multichannel is used, the primary
channel maybe down. So it does not make sense to rely only
on that channel.

This fix makes this function pick a channel with the standard
helper function cifs_pick_channel.

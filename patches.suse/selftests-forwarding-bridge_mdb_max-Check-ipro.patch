Subject: [PATCH] selftests: forwarding: bridge_mdb_max: Check iproute2 version
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.11
Git-commit: 6bdf3d9765f4e0eebfd919e70acc65bce5daa9b9

commit 6bdf3d9765f4e0eebfd919e70acc65bce5daa9b9 upstream.

The selftest relies on iproute2 changes present in version 6.3, but the
test does not check for it, resulting in errors:

 # ./bridge_mdb_max.sh
  INFO: 802.1d tests
  TEST: cfg4: port: ngroups reporting                                 [FAIL]
          Number of groups was null, now is null, but 5 expected
  TEST: ctl4: port: ngroups reporting                                 [FAIL]
          Number of groups was null, now is null, but 5 expected
  TEST: cfg6: port: ngroups reporting                                 [FAIL]
          Number of groups was null, now is null, but 5 expected
  [...]

Fix by skipping the test if iproute2 is too old.

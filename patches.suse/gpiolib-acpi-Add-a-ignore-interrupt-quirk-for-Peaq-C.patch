Subject: [PATCH] gpiolib: acpi: Add a ignore interrupt quirk for Peaq C1010
Git-commit: 6cc64f6173751d212c9833bde39e856b4f585a3e
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

On the Peaq C1010 2-in-1 INT33FC:00 pin 3 is connected to
a "dolby" button. At the ACPI level an _AEI event-handler
is connected which sets an ACPI variable to 1 on both
edges. This variable can be polled + cleared to 0 using WMI.

Since the variable is set on both edges the WMI interface is pretty
useless even when polling. So instead of writing a custom WMI
driver for this the x86-android-tablets code instantiates
a gpio-keys platform device for the "dolby" button.

Add an ignore_interrupt quirk for INT33FC:00 pin 3 on the Peaq C1010,
so that it is not seen as busy when the gpio-keys driver requests it.

Note this replaces a hack in x86-android-tablets where it would
call acpi_gpiochip_free_interrupts() on the INT33FC:00 GPIO
controller. acpi_gpiochip_free_interrupts() is considered private
(internal) gpiolib API so x86-android-tablets should stop using it.

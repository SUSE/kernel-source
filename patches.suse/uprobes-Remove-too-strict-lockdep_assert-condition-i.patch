Subject: uprobes: Remove too strict lockdep_assert() condition in
 hprobe_expire()
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc5
Git-commit: f8c857238a392f21d5726d07966f6061007c8d4f
References: jsc#PED-14653

hprobe_expire() is used to atomically switch pending uretprobe instance
(struct return_instance) from being SRCU protected to be refcounted.
This can be done from background timer thread, or synchronously within
current thread when task is forked.

In the former case, return_instance has to be protected through RCU read
lock, and that's what hprobe_expire() used to check with
lockdep_assert(rcu_read_lock_held()).

But in the latter case (hprobe_expire() called from dup_utask()) there
is no RCU lock being held, and it's both unnecessary and incovenient.
Inconvenient due to the intervening memory allocations inside
dup_return_instance()'s loop. Unnecessary because dup_utask() is called
synchronously in current thread, and no uretprobe can run at that point,
so return_instance can't be freed either.

So drop rcu_read_lock_held() condition, and expand corresponding comment
to explain necessary lifetime guarantees. lockdep_assert()-detected
issue is a false positive.

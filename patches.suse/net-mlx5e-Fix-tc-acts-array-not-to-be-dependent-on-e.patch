Subject: net/mlx5e: Fix tc acts array not to be dependent on enum order
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc5
Git-commit: 08912ea799cd2a43b8999457e316967fe4e2f327
References: jsc#PED-1549

The tc acts array should not be dependent on kernel internal
flow action id enum. Fix the array initialization.

Fixes: fad547906980 ("net/mlx5e: Add tc action infrastructure")

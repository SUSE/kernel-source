Subject: [PATCH] smb3: smbdirect support can be configured by default
Git-commit: 2bcb4fd6ba9152c699d873ffa4593d5a4fe1f8d4
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: bsc#1192606

smbdirect support (SMB3 over RDMA) should be enabled by
default in many configurations.

It is not experimental and is stable enough and has enough
performance benefits to recommend that it be configured by
default.  Change the  "If unsure N" to "If unsure Y" in
the description of the configuration parameter.

Subject: lib: packing: remove kernel-doc from header file
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
Git-commit: 816ad8f1e498fe5e9e992da137316302219f2137
References: jsc#PED-10419

It is not necessary to have the kernel-doc duplicated both in the
header and in the implementation. It is better to have it near the
implementation of the function, since in C, a function can have N
declarations, but only one definition.

-/**
- * packing - Convert numbers (currently u64) between a packed and an unpacked
- *	     format. Unpacked means laid out in memory in the CPU's native
- *	     understanding of integers, while packed means anything else that
- *	     requires translation.
- *
- * @pbuf: Pointer to a buffer holding the packed value.
- * @uval: Pointer to an u64 holding the unpacked value.
- * @startbit: The index (in logical notation, compensated for quirks) where
- *	      the packed value starts within pbuf. Must be larger than, or
- *	      equal to, endbit.
- * @endbit: The index (in logical notation, compensated for quirks) where
- *	    the packed value ends within pbuf. Must be smaller than, or equal
- *	    to, startbit.
- * @op: If PACK, then uval will be treated as const pointer and copied (packed)
- *	into pbuf, between startbit and endbit.
- *	If UNPACK, then pbuf will be treated as const pointer and the logical
- *	value between startbit and endbit will be copied (unpacked) to uval.
- * @quirks: A bit mask of QUIRK_LITTLE_ENDIAN, QUIRK_LSW32_IS_FIRST and
- *	    QUIRK_MSB_ON_THE_RIGHT.
- *
- * Return: 0 on success, EINVAL or ERANGE if called incorrectly. Assuming
- *	   correct usage, return code may be discarded.
- *	   If op is PACK, pbuf is modified.
- *	   If op is UNPACK, uval is modified.

Subject: [PATCH] raid5: don't set the discard_alignment queue limit
Git-commit: 3d50d368c92ade2f98a3d0d28b842a57c35284e9
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1183

The discard_alignment queue limit is named a bit misleading means the
offset into the block device at which the discard granularity starts.
Setting it to the discard granularity as done by raid5 is mostly
harmless but also useless.

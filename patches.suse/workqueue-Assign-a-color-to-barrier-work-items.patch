Subject: [PATCH 5/5] workqueue: Assign a color to barrier work items
Git-commit: d812796eb3906424cd3c0eea530983961e2f88bd
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1190232

There was no strong reason to or not to flush barrier work items in
flush_workqueue().  And we have to make barrier work items not participate
in nr_active so we had been using WORK_NO_COLOR for them which also makes
them can't be flushed by flush_workqueue().

And the users of flush_workqueue() often do not intend to wait barrier work
items issued by flush_work().  That made the choice sound perfect.

But barrier work items have reference to internal structure (pool_workqueue)
and the worker thread[s] is/are still busy for the workqueue user when the
barrrier work items are not done.  So it is reasonable to make flush_workqueue()
also watch for flush_work() to make it more robust.

And a problem[1] reported by Li Zhe shows that we need such robustness.
The warning logs are listed below:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 19336 at kernel/workqueue.c:4430 destroy_workqueue+0x11a/0x2f0
*****
destroy_workqueue: test_workqueue9 has the following busy pwq
  pwq 4: cpus=2 node=0 flags=0x0 nice=0 active=0/1 refcnt=2
      in-flight: 5658:wq_barrier_func
Showing busy workqueues and worker pools:
*****

It shows that even after drain_workqueue() returns, the barrier work item
is still in flight and the pwq (and a worker) is still busy on it.

The problem is caused by flush_workqueue() not watching flush_work():

Thread A				Worker
					/* normal work item with linked */
					process_scheduled_works()
destroy_workqueue()			  process_one_work()
  drain_workqueue()			    /* run normal work item */
				 /--	    pwq_dec_nr_in_flight()
    flush_workqueue()	    <---/
		/* the last normal work item is done */
  sanity_check				  process_one_work()
				       /--  raw_spin_unlock_irq(&pool->lock)
    raw_spin_lock_irq(&pool->lock)  <-/     /* maybe preempt */
    *WARNING*				    wq_barrier_func()
					    /* maybe preempt by cond_resched() */

Thread A can get the pool lock after the Worker unlocks the pool lock before
running wq_barrier_func().  And if there is any preemption happen around
wq_barrier_func(), destroy_workqueue()'s sanity check is more likely to
get the lock and catch it.  (Note: preemption is not necessary to cause the bug,
the unlocking is enough to possibly trigger the WARNING.)

A simple solution might be just executing all linked barrier work items
once without releasing pool lock after the head work item's
pwq_dec_nr_in_flight().  But this solution has two problems:

  1) the head work item might also be barrier work item when the user-queued
     work item is cancelled. For example:
	thread 1:		thread 2:
	queue_work(wq, &my_work)
	flush_work(&my_work)
				cancel_work_sync(&my_work);
	/* Neiter my_work nor the barrier work is scheduled. */
				destroy_workqueue(wq);
	/* This is an easier way to catch the WARNING. */

  2) there might be too much linked barrier work items and running them
     all once without releasing pool lock just causes trouble.

The only solution is to make flush_workqueue() aslo watch barrier work
items.  So we have to assign a color to these barrier work items which
is the color of the head (user-queued) work item.

Assigning a color doesn't cause any problem in ative management, because
the prvious patch made barrier work items not participate in nr_active
via WORK_STRUCT_INACTIVE rather than reliance on the (old) WORK_NO_COLOR.

Subject: [PATCH 144/155] x86/kexec: do unconditional WBINVD for bare-metal in
 relocate_kernel()

Both SME and TDX can leave caches in incoherent state due to memory
encryption.  During kexec, the caches must be flushed before jumping to
the second kernel to avoid silent memory corruption to the second kernel.

During kexec, the WBINVD in stop_this_cpu() flushes caches for all
remote cpus when they are being stopped.  For SME, the WBINVD in
relocate_kernel() flushes the cache for the last running cpu (which is
executing the kexec).

Similarly, to support kexec for TDX host, after stopping all remote cpus
with cache flushed, the kernel needs to flush cache for the last running
cpu.

Use the existing WBINVD in relocate_kernel() to cover TDX host as well.

However, instead of sprinkling around vendor-specific checks, just do
unconditional WBINVD to cover both SME and TDX.  Kexec is not a fast path
so having one additional WBINVD for platforms w/o SME/TDX is acceptable.

But only do WBINVD for bare-metal because TDX guests and SEV-ES/SEV-SNP
guests will get unexpected (and yet unnecessary) exception (#VE or #VC)
which the kernel is unable to handle at this stage.

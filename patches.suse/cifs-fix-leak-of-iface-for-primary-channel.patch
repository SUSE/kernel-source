Subject: [PATCH] cifs: fix leak of iface for primary channel
Git-commit: 29954d5b1e0d67a4cd61c30c2201030c97e94b1e
References: git-fixes, bsc#1224020
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc2

My last change in this area introduced a change which
accounted for primary channel in the interface ref count.
However, it did not reduce this ref count on deallocation
of the primary channel. i.e. during umount.

Fixing this leak here, by dropping this ref count for
primary channel while freeing up the session.

Fixes: fa1d0508bdd4 ("cifs: account for primary channel in the interface list")

Subject: [PATCH] iomap: Fix negative assignment to unsigned sis->pages in
 iomap_swapfile_activate
Git-commit: 5808fecc572391867fcd929662b29c12e6d08d81
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc4
References: bsc#1190784

In case if isi.nr_pages is 0, we are making sis->pages (which is
unsigned int) a huge value in iomap_swapfile_activate() by assigning -1.
This could cause a kernel crash in kernel v4.18 (with below signature).
Or could lead to unknown issues on latest kernel if the fake big swap gets
used.

Fix this issue by returning -EINVAL in case of nr_pages is 0, since it
is anyway a invalid swapfile. Looks like this issue will be hit when
we have pagesize < blocksize type of configuration.

I was able to hit the issue in case of a tiny swap file with below
test script.

kernel crash analysis on v4.18
==============================
On v4.18 kernel, it causes a kernel panic, since sis->pages becomes
a huge value and isi.nr_extents is 0. When 0 is returned it is
considered as a swapfile over NFS and SWP_FILE is set (sis->flags |= SWP_FILE).
Then when swapoff was getting called it was calling a_ops->swap_deactivate()
if (sis->flags & SWP_FILE) is true. Since a_ops->swap_deactivate() is
NULL in case of XFS, it causes below panic.

Panic signature on v4.18 kernel:

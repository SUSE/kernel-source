Subject: b43: Change firmware missing message to refer to openSUSE script
From: Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>
Patch-mainline: never, openSUSE-specific

The error message output by b43 contains instructions for obtaining
firmware; however, this naturally does not take account of the script
/usr/sbin/install_bcm43xx_firmware. Modify the messages to suggest use
of the script.

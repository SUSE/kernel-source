Subject: [PATCH] docs: i2c: i2c-sysfs: fix hyperlinks
Git-commit: fe99b819487dba848cddd3d4bf4beb8e653d7e9c
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

dts files cannot be linked conveniently, thus replace them with literal
formatting.

The links to other rst pages are broken, fix them using the proper syntax.

 This may be a confusing part for people who only know about the physical I2C

 how to implement this in DTS, but we can see an example in:

Subject: regulator: mt6358: Add OF match table
Patch-mainline: Submitted, 20210109112612.1221-2-matthias.bgg@kernel.org
References: bsc#1180731

The binding documentation mentions that a compatible is required for the
MT6358 device node. But the driver does not provide a OF match table.
This way auto-loading is broken as the MFD driver that registers the
device has a .of_compatible set which makes the platform .uevent
callback report a OF modalias, but that's not in the module.

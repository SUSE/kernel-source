Subject: [PATCH] fs: dlm: fix log of lowcomms vs midcomms
Git-commit: 3e54c9e80e68b765d8877023d93f1eea1b9d1c54
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

This patch will fix a small issue when printing out that
dlm_midcomms_start() failed to start and it was printing out that the
dlm subcomponent lowcomms was failed but lowcomms is behind the midcomms
layer.

Subject: dm-verity: disable recursive forward error correction
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
Git-commit: d9f3e47d3fae0c101d9094bc956ed24e7a0ee801
References: CVE-2025-71161, bsc#1257174

There are two problems with the recursive correction:

1. It may cause denial-of-service. In fec_read_bufs, there is a loop that
has 253 iterations. For each iteration, we may call verity_hash_for_block
recursively. There is a limit of 4 nested recursions - that means that
there may be at most 253^4 (4 billion) iterations. Red Hat QE team
actually created an image that pushes dm-verity to this limit - and this
image just makes the udev-worker process get stuck in the 'D' state.

2. It doesn't work. In fec_read_bufs we store data into the variable
"fio->bufs", but fio bufs is shared between recursive invocations, if
"verity_hash_for_block" invoked correction recursively, it would
overwrite partially filled fio->bufs.

mwilck: the original patch bumps the version of the verity target
  to 0.13.0. I changed this to 0.10.1. See bsc#1257174.

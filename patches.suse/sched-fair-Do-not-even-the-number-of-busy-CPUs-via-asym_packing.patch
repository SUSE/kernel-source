Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Do not even the number of busy CPUs via
 asym_packing

References: bsc#1212887 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: c9ca07886aaa40225a29e5c1e46ac31d2e14f53a
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1

Now that find_busiest_group() triggers load balancing between a fully_
busy SMT2 core and an idle non-SMT core, it is no longer needed to force
balancing via asym_packing. Use asym_packing only as intended: when there
is high-priority CPU that is idle.

After this change, the same logic apply to SMT and non-SMT local groups.
It makes less sense having a separate function to deal specifically with
SMT. Fold the logic in asym_smt_can_pull_tasks() into sched_asym().

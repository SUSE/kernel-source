Subject: KVM: Add KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT exit to report faults to userspace
Git-commit: 16f95f3b95caded251a0440051e44a2fbe9e5f55
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: jsc#PED-5122

Add a new KVM exit type to allow userspace to handle memory faults that
KVM cannot resolve, but that userspace *may* be able to handle (without
terminating the guest).

KVM will initially use KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT to report implicit
conversions between private and shared memory.  With guest private memory,
there will be two kind of memory conversions:

  - explicit conversion: happens when the guest explicitly calls into KVM
    to map a range (as private or shared)

  - implicit conversion: happens when the guest attempts to access a gfn
    that is configured in the "wrong" state (private vs. shared)

On x86 (first architecture to support guest private memory), explicit
conversions will be reported via KVM_EXIT_HYPERCALL+KVM_HC_MAP_GPA_RANGE,
but reporting KVM_EXIT_HYPERCALL for implicit conversions is undesriable
as there is (obviously) no hypercall, and there is no guarantee that the
guest actually intends to convert between private and shared, i.e. what
KVM thinks is an implicit conversion "request" could actually be the
result of a guest code bug.

KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT will be used to report memory faults that appear to
be implicit conversions.

Note!  To allow for future possibilities where KVM reports
KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT and fills run->memory_fault on _any_ unresolved
fault, KVM returns "-EFAULT" (-1 with errno == EFAULT from userspace's
perspective), not '0'!  Due to historical baggage within KVM, exiting to
userspace with '0' from deep callstacks, e.g. in emulation paths, is
infeasible as doing so would require a near-complete overhaul of KVM,
whereas KVM already propagates -errno return codes to userspace even when
the -errno originated in a low level helper.

Report the gpa+size instead of a single gfn even though the initial usage
is expected to always report single pages.  It's entirely possible, likely
even, that KVM will someday support sub-page granularity faults, e.g.
Intel's sub-page protection feature allows for additional protections at
128-byte granularity.

+KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT indicates the vCPU has encountered a memory fault that
+could not be resolved by KVM.  The 'gpa' and 'size' (in bytes) describe the

+describes properties of the faulting access that are likely pertinent.
+Currently, no flags are defined.
+
+Note!  KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT is unique among all KVM exit reasons in that it
+accompanies a return code of '-1', not '0'!  errno will always be set to EFAULT

+7.34 KVM_CAP_MEMORY_FAULT_INFO
+------------------------------
+
+:Architectures: x86
+:Returns: Informational only, -EINVAL on direct KVM_ENABLE_CAP.
+
+The presence of this capability indicates that KVM_RUN will fill
+kvm_run.memory_fault if KVM cannot resolve a guest page fault VM-Exit, e.g. if
+there is a valid memslot but no backing VMA for the corresponding host virtual
+address.
+
+The information in kvm_run.memory_fault is valid if and only if KVM_RUN returns
+an error with errno=EFAULT or errno=EHWPOISON *and* kvm_run.exit_reason is set
+to KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT.
+
+Note: Userspaces which attempt to resolve memory faults so that they can retry
+KVM_RUN are encouraged to guard against repeatedly receiving the same
+error/annotated fault.
+
+See KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT for more information.

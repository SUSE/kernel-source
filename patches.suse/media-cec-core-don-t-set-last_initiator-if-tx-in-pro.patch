Subject: [PATCH] media: cec: core: don't set last_initiator if tx in progress
Git-commit: 73af6c7511038249cad3d5f3b44bf8d78ac0f499
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc5
References: git-fixes

When a message was received the last_initiator is set to 0xff.
This will force the signal free time for the next transmit
to that for a new initiator. However, if a new transmit is
already in progress, then don't set last_initiator, since
that's the initiator of the current transmit. Overwriting
this would cause the signal free time of a following transmit
to be that of the new initiator instead of a next transmit.

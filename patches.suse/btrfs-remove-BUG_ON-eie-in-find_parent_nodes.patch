Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: remove BUG_ON(!eie) in find_parent_nodes
Git-commit: 9f05c09d6baef789726346397438cca4ec43c3ee
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

If we're looking for leafs that point to a data extent we want to record
the extent items that point at our bytenr.  At this point we have the
reference and we know for a fact that this leaf should have a reference
to our bytenr.  However if there's some sort of corruption we may not
find any references to our leaf, and thus could end up with eie == NULL.
Replace this BUG_ON() with an ASSERT() and then return -EUCLEAN for the
mortals.

Subject: [PATCH] watchdog/hpwdt: Only claim UNKNOWN NMI if from iLO
Git-commit: dced0b3e51dd2af3730efe14dd86b5e3173f0a65
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

Avoid unnecessary crashes by claiming only NMIs that are due to
ERROR signalling or generated by the hpwdt hardware device.

The code does this, but only for iLO5.

The intent was to preserve legacy, Gen9 and earlier, semantics of
using hpwdt for error containtment as hardware/firmware would signal
fatal IO errors as an NMI with the expectation of hpwdt crashing
the system.  Howerver, these IO errors should be received by hpwdt
as an NMI_IO_CHECK.  So the test is overly permissive and should
not be limited to only ilo5.

We need to enable this protection for future iLOs not matching the
current PCI IDs.

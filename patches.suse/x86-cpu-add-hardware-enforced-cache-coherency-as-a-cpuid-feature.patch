Subject: x86/cpu: Add hardware-enforced cache coherency as a CPUID feature
Git-commit: 5866e9205b47a983a77ebc8654949f696342f2ab
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: bsc#1178134

In some hardware implementations, coherency between the encrypted and
unencrypted mappings of the same physical page is enforced. In such a system,
it is not required for software to flush the page from all CPU caches in the
system prior to changing the value of the C-bit for a page. This hardware-
enforced cache coherency is indicated by EAX[10] in CPUID leaf 0x8000001f.

 [ bp: Use one of the free slots in word 3. ]
 [ bp: backporting notes. 3*32+17 wasn't free so use 3*32+29 ]

Subject: [PATCH] ublk: don't allow user copy for unprivileged device
Git-commit: 42aafd8b48adac1c3b20fe5892b1b91b80c1a1e6
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc4
References: CVE-2024-50080 bsc#1232502

UBLK_F_USER_COPY requires userspace to call write() on ublk char
device for filling request buffer, and unprivileged device can't
be trusted.

So don't allow user copy for unprivileged device.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: video: Add backlight=native quirk for Lenovo Slim 7 16ARH7
Date: Mon,  6 May 2024 16:08:50 +0200
Message-id: <20240506140906.26034-1-tiwai@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, linux-acpi ML
References: bsc#1217750

Lenovo Slim 7 16ARH7 is a machine with switchable graphics between AMD
and Nvidia, and the backlight can't be adjusted properly unless
acpi_backlight=native is passed.  Although nvidia-wmi-backlight is
present and loaded, this doesn't work as expected at all.

For making it working as default, add the corresponding quirk entry
with a DMI matching "LENOVO" "82UX".

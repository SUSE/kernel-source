Subject: [PATCH] spi: dw_bt1: fix MUX_MMIO dependencies
Git-commit: d4bde04318c0d33705e9a77d4c7df72f262011e0
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

Selecting a symbol with additional dependencies requires
adding the same dependency here:

Warning: unmet direct dependencies detected for MUX_MMIO  Depends on [n]: MULTIPLEXER [=y] && OF [=n]  Selected by [y]:  - SPI_DW_BT1 [=y] && SPI [=y] && SPI_MASTER [=y] && SPI_DESIGNWARE [=y] && (MIPS_BAIKAL_T1 || COMPILE_TEST [=y])

Drop the 'select' here to avoid the problem. Anyone using
the dw-bt1 SPI driver should make sure they include the
mux driver as well now.

Fixes: 7218838109fe ("spi: dw-bt1: Fix undefined devm_mux_control_get symbol")
Fixes: abf00907538e ("spi: dw: Add Baikal-T1 SPI Controller glue driver")

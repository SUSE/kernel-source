 	  This adds support for Intel Visual Sensing Controller (IVSC).
 
-	  Enables the IVSC firmware services required for controlling
-	  camera sensor ownership and CSI-2 link through Image Processing
-	  Unit(IPU) driver of Intel.
+	  The IVSC support is split into two devices, ACE (Algorithm
+	  Context Engine) and CSI (Camera Serial Interface), each of which
+	  have their own drivers. The ACE is used to select the ownership
+	  of the sensor between the IVSC and the host CPU while the CSI is
+	  used to both select the routing destination for the data the
+	  sensor transmits over the CSI-2 bus between the IVSC and the
+	  host CPU and to configure the CSI-2 bus itself.
+
+	  The modules will be called ivsc-ace and ivsc-csi.

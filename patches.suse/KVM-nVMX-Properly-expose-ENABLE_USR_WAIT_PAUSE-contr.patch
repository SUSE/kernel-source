Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Properly expose ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE control to
 L1

Set ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE in KVM's supported VMX MSR configuration if the
feature is supported in hardware and enabled in KVM's base, non-nested
configuration, i.e. expose ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE to L1 if it's supported.
This fixes a bug where saving/restoring, i.e. migrating, a vCPU will fail
if WAITPKG (the associated CPUID feature) is enabled for the vCPU, and
obviously allows L1 to enable the feature for L2.

KVM already effectively exposes ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE to L1 by stuffing
the allowed-1 control ina vCPU's virtual MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 when
updating secondary controls in response to KVM_SET_CPUID(2), but (a) that
depends on flawed code (KVM shouldn't touch VMX MSRs in response to CPUID
updates) and (b) runs afoul of vmx_restore_control_msr()'s restriction
that the guest value must be a strict subset of the supported host value.

Although no past commit explicitly enabled nested support for WAITPKG,
doing so is safe and functionally correct from an architectural
perspective as no additional KVM support is needed to virtualize TPAUSE,
UMONITOR, and UMWAIT for L2 relative to L1, and KVM already forwards
VM-Exits to L1 as necessary (commit bf653b78f960, "KVM: vmx: Introduce
handle_unexpected_vmexit and handle WAITPKG vmexit").

Note, KVM always keeps the hosts MSR_IA32_UMWAIT_CONTROL resident in
hardware, i.e. always runs both L1 and L2 with the host's power management
settings for TPAUSE and UMWAIT.  See commit bf09fb6cba4f ("KVM: VMX: Stop
context switching MSR_IA32_UMWAIT_CONTROL") for more details.

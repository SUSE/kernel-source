Subject: hwmon: (k10temp) Remove residues of current and voltage
Git-commit: 23c69b90365c8280b627aa969393d828ff47ac14
Patch-mainline: v5.15
References: jsc#SLE-17823 jsc#SLE-23139 jsc#ECO-3666

Commit id "b00647c46c9d7f6ee1ff6aaf335906101755e614",
adds reporting current and voltage to k10temp.c

The commit id "0a4e668b5d52eed8026f5d717196b02b55fb2dc6",
removed reporting current and voltage from k10temp.c

The curr and in(voltage) entries are not removed from
"k10temp_info" structure. Removing those residue entries.
while at it, update k10temp driver documentation

-Various Family 17h and 18h CPUs report voltage and current telemetry

-Current values are raw (unscaled) as reported by the CPU. Core current is
-reported as multiples of 1A / LSB. SoC is reported as multiples of 0.25A
-/ LSB. The real current is board specific. Reported currents should be seen
-as rough guidance, and should be scaled using sensors3.conf as appropriate
-for a given board.

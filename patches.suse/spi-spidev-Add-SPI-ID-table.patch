Subject: [PATCH] spi: spidev: Add SPI ID table
Git-commit: 6840615f85f6046039ebc4989870ddb12892b7fc
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc6
References: git-fixes

Currently autoloading for SPI devices does not use the DT ID table, it uses
SPI modalises. Supporting OF modalises is going to be difficult if not
impractical, an attempt was made but has been reverted, so ensure that
module autoloading works for this driver by adding an id_table listing the
SPI IDs for everything.

Fixes: 96c8395e2166 ("spi: Revert modalias changes")

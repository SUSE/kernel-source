Subject: [PATCH] regulator: pwm-regulator: Calculate the output voltage for disabled PWMs
Git-commit: 6a7d11efd6915d80a025f2a0be4ae09d797b91ec
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc3
References: stable-fixes

If a PWM output is disabled then it's voltage has to be calculated
based on a zero duty cycle (for normal polarity) or duty cycle being
equal to the PWM period (for inverted polarity). Add support for this
to pwm_regulator_get_voltage().

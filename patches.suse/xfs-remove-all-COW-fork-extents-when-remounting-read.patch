Subject: [PATCH] xfs: remove all COW fork extents when remounting readonly
Git-commit: 089558bc7ba785c03815a49c89e28ad9b8de51f9
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc5
References: git-fixes

As part of multiple customer escalations due to file data corruption
after copy on write operations, I wrote some fstests that use fsstress
to hammer on COW to shake things loose.  Regrettably, I caught some
filesystem shutdowns due to incorrect rmap operations with the following
Loop: 

mount <filesystem>				# (0)
fsstress <run only readonly ops> &		# (1)
while true; do
	fsstress <run all ops>
	mount -o remount,ro			# (2)
	fsstress <run only readonly ops>
	mount -o remount,rw			# (3)
done

When (2) happens, notice that (1) is still running.  xfs_remount_ro will
call xfs_blockgc_stop to walk the inode cache to free all the COW
extents, but the blockgc mechanism races with (1)'s reader threads to
take IOLOCKs and loses, which means that it doesn't clean them all out.
Call such a file (A).

When (3) happens, xfs_remount_rw calls xfs_reflink_recover_cow, which
walks the ondisk refcount btree and frees any COW extent that it finds.
This function does not check the inode cache, which means that incore
COW forks of inode (A) is now inconsistent with the ondisk metadata.  If
one of those former COW extents are allocated and mapped into another
file (B) and someone triggers a COW to the stale reservation in (A), A's
dirty data will be written into (B) and once that's done, those blocks
will be transferred to (A)'s data fork without bumping the refcount.

The results are catastrophic -- file (B) and the refcount btree are now
corrupt.  Solve this race by forcing the xfs_blockgc_free_space to run
synchronously, which causes xfs_icwalk to return to inodes that were
skipped because the blockgc code couldn't take the IOLOCK.  This is safe
to do here because the VFS has already prohibited new writer threads.

Subject: [PATCH] clk: jz4725b: fix mmc0 clock gating
Git-commit: 2f0754f27a230fee6e6d753f07585cee03bedfe3
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc6
References: git-fixes

The mmc0 clock gate bit was mistakenly assigned to "i2s" clock.
You can find that the same bit is assigned to "mmc0" too.
It leads to mmc0 hang for a long time after any sound activity
also it  prevented PM_SLEEP to work properly.
I guess it was introduced by copy-paste from jz4740 driver
where it is really controls I2S clock gate.

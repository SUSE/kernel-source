Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/idle: Don't corrupt back chain when going idle

References: bko#206669 bsc#1174585 bsc#1192107 CVE-2021-43056
Patch-mainline: v5.15 or v5.15-rc7 (next release)
Git-commit: 496c5fe25c377ddb7815c4ce8ecfb676f051e9b6

In isa206_idle_insn_mayloss() we store various registers into the stack
red zone, which is allowed.

However inside the IDLE_STATE_ENTER_SEQ_NORET macro we save r2 again,
to 0(r1), which corrupts the stack back chain.

We used to do the same in isa206_idle_insn_mayloss() itself, but we
fixed that in 73287caa9210 ("powerpc64/idle: Fix SP offsets when saving
GPRs"), however we missed that the macro also corrupts the back chain.

Corrupting the back chain is bad for debuggability but doesn't
necessarily cause a bug.

However we recently changed the stack handling in some KVM code, and it
now relies on the stack back chain being valid when it returns. The
corruption causes that code to return with r1 pointing somewhere in
kernel data, at some point LR is restored from the stack and we branch
to NULL or somewhere else invalid.

Only affects Power8 hosts running KVM guests, with dynamic_mt_modes
enabled (which it is by default).

The fixes tag below points to the commit that changed the KVM stack
handling, exposing this bug. The actual corruption of the back chain has
always existed since 948cf67c4726 ("powerpc: Add NAP mode support on
Power7 in HV mode").

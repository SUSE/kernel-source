Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

The "wait usec" DSB command doesn't quite seem to able to
guarantee that it always waits at least the specified
amount of usecs. Some of that could be just because it
supposedly just does some kind of dumb timestamp comparison
internally. But I also see cases where two hardware timestamps
sampled on each side of the "wait usec" command come out one
less than expected. So it looks like we always need at least a
+1 to guarantee that we never wait less than specified. Always
apply that adjustment in dsb_wait_usec().

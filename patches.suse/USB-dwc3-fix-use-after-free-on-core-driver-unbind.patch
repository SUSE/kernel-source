Subject: [PATCH] USB: dwc3: fix use-after-free on core driver unbind
Git-commit: e3dbb657571509044be15184a13134fa7c1fdca1
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc7
References: git-fixes

Some dwc3 glue drivers are currently accessing the driver data of the
child core device directly, which is clearly a bad idea as the child may
not have probed yet or may have been unbound from its driver.

As a workaround until the glue drivers have been fixed, clear the driver
data pointer before allowing the glue parent device to runtime suspend
to prevent its driver from accessing data that has been freed during
unbind.

Fixes: 6895ea55c385 ("usb: dwc3: qcom: Configure wakeup interrupts during suspend")

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: Throttle commits on delayed background CIL push
Git-commit: 0e7ab7efe77451cba4cbecb6c9f5ef83cf32b36b
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

In certain situations the background CIL push can be indefinitely
delayed. While we have workarounds from the obvious cases now, it
doesn't solve the underlying issue. This issue is that there is no
upper limit on the CIL where we will either force or wait for
a background push to start, hence allowing the CIL to grow without
bound until it consumes all log space.

To fix this, add a new wait queue to the CIL which allows background
pushes to wait for the CIL context to be switched out. This happens
when the push starts, so it will allow us to block incoming
transaction commit completion until the push has started. This will
only affect processes that are running modifications, and only when
the CIL threshold has been significantly overrun.

This has no apparent impact on performance, and doesn't even trigger
until over 45 million inodes had been created in a 16-way fsmark
test on a 2GB log. That was limiting at 64MB of log space used, so
the active CIL size is only about 3% of the total log in that case.
The concurrent removal of those files did not trigger the background
sleep at all.

Subject: vhost-vdpa: call vhost_vdpa_cleanup during the release

References: jsc#PED-1549

Before commit 3d5698793897 ("vhost-vdpa: introduce asid based IOTLB")
we call vhost_vdpa_iotlb_free() during the release to clean all regions
mapped in the iotlb.

That commit removed vhost_vdpa_iotlb_free() and added vhost_vdpa_cleanup()
to do some cleanup, including deleting all mappings, but we forgot to call
it in vhost_vdpa_release().

This causes that if an application does not remove all mappings explicitly
(or it crashes), the mappings remain in the iotlb and subsequent
applications may fail if they map the same addresses.

Calling vhost_vdpa_cleanup() also fixes a memory leak since we are not
freeing `v->vdev.vqs` during the release from the same commit.

Since vhost_vdpa_cleanup() calls vhost_dev_cleanup() we can remove its
call from vhost_vdpa_release().

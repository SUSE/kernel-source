Subject: [PATCH] JFS: more checks for invalid superblock
Git-commit: 3bef198f1b17d1bb89260bad947ef084c0a2d1a6
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

syzbot is feeding invalid superblock data to JFS for mount testing.
JFS does not check several of the fields -- just assumes that they
are good since the JFS_MAGIC and version fields are good.

In this case (syzbot reproducer), we have s_l2bsize == 0xda0c,
pad == 0xf045, and s_state == 0x50, all of which are invalid IMO.
Having s_l2bsize == 0xda0c causes this UBSAN warning:
  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/jfs/jfs_mount.c:373:25
  shift exponent -9716 is negative

s_l2bsize can be tested for correctness. pad can be tested for non-0
and punted. s_state can be tested for its valid values and punted.

Do those 3 tests and if any of them fails, report the superblock as
invalid/corrupt and let fsck handle it.

With this patch, chkSuper() says this when JFS_DEBUG is enabled:
  jfs_mount: Mount Failure: superblock is corrupt!
  Mount JFS Failure: -22
  jfs_mount failed w/return code = -22

The obvious problem with this method is that next week there could
be another syzbot test that uses different fields for invalid values,
this making this like a game of whack-a-mole.

Subject: arm: dts: dra76x: Fix mmc3 max-frequency
Git-commit: fa63c0039787b8fbacf4d6a51e3ff44288f5b90b
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc5
References: git-fixes

dra76x is not affected by i887 which requires mmc3 node to be limited to
a max frequency of 64 MHz. Fix this by overwriting the correct value in
the the dra76 specific dtsi.

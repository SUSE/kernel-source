Subject: efi/zboot: Fix outdated comment about using LoadImage/StartImage
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
Git-commit: 6fce6e9791685e95b70144a414eb90132e497489
References: jsc#PED-12274

EFI zboot no longer uses LoadImage/StartImage, but subsumes the arch
code to load and start the bare metal image directly. Fix the Kconfig
description accordingly.

Subject: Revert "cpufreq: Avoid configuring old governors as default
 with intel_pstate"
Patch-mainline: Never, upstream is promoting schedutil but there is a notable performance regression
References: bsc#1190923

This reverts commit db865272d9c4687520dc29f77e701a1b2669872f ("cpufreq: Avoid
configuring old governors as default with intel_pstate"). That commit makes it
impossible to configure the cpufreq governor "ondemand" as default governor on
x86_64 systems. The intent was to favor the governor "schedutil" when the
driver intel_pstate is used in passive mode; as a side effect, AMD machines
can no longer default to the ondemand governor, which is undesirable.

This patch is a pre-requisite to setting

  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_ONDEMAND=y

in the SLES config for x86_64, as it has been for previous SLES releases.

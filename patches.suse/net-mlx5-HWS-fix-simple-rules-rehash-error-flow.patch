Subject: net/mlx5: HWS, fix simple rules rehash error flow
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc3
Git-commit: 615b690612b7785ab8632f6a5a941550622e4e36
References: git-fixes

Moving rules from matcher to matcher should not fail.
However, if it does fail due to various reasons, the error flow
should allow the kernel to continue functioning (albeit with broken
steering rules) instead of going into series of soft lock-ups or
some other problematic behaviour.

This patch fixes the error flow for moving simple rules:
 - If new rule creation fails before it was even enqeued, do not
   poll for completion
 - If TIMEOUT happened while moving the rule, no point trying
   to poll for completions for other rules. Something is broken,
   completion won't come, just abort the rehash sequence.
 - If some other completion with error received, don't give up.
   Continue handling rest of the rules to minimize the damage.
 - Make sure that the first error code that was received will
   be actually returned to the caller instead of replacing it
   with the generic error code.

All the aforementioned issues stem from the same bad error flow,
so no point fixing them one by one and leaving partially broken
code - fixing them in one patch.

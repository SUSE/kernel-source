Subject: video:backlight: remove reference to AVR32 architecture in ltv350qv
Git-commit: 2fb0ec4ae5632ba288ab233849f85069d4c475a5
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

The AVR32 architecture does no longer exist in the Linux kernel, hence
remove a reference to also non-existing Linux BSP CD from Atmel.

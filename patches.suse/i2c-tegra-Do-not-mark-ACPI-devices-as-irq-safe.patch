Subject: [PATCH] i2c: tegra: Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safe
Git-commit: 14d069d92951a3e150c0a81f2ca3b93e54da913b
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc4
References: CVE-2024-45029 bsc#1230451

On ACPI machines, the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to a
mutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug:

	BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:585
	...

	Call trace:
	__might_sleep
	__mutex_lock_common
	mutex_lock_nested
	acpi_subsys_runtime_resume
	rpm_resume
	tegra_i2c_xfer

The problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume(), the spinlock
&dev->power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later,
rpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), which relies on
mutexes, triggering the error.

To address this issue, devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe,
considering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.

Subject: mm: migrate: fix return value if all subpages of THPs are migrated
 successfully
Git-commit: 03e5f82ea632af329e32ec03d952b2d99497eeaa
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc3
References: jsc#PED-1247

During THP migration, if THPs are not migrated but they are split and all
subpages are migrated successfully, migrate_pages() will still return the
number of THP pages that were not migrated.  This will confuse the callers
of migrate_pages().  For example, the longterm pinning will failed though
all pages are migrated successfully.

Thus we should return 0 to indicate that all pages are migrated in this
case

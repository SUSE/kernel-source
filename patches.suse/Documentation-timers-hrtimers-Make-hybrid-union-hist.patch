Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: timers: hrtimers: Make hybrid union historical
Git-commit: 4c093cbb89f32762555f624882f1d31a79237eaf
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

Non-scalar time was removed from the ktime hybrid union in v3.17, and
the union itself followed suit in v4.10.

Make it clear that ktime_t is always a 64bit scalar type, to avoid
confusing the casual reader.

While at it, fix a spelling mistake.

Fixes: 24e4a8c3e8868874 ("ktime: Kill non-scalar ktime_t implementation for 2038")
Fixes: 2456e855354415bf ("ktime: Get rid of the union")

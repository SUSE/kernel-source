Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: wm8737: Update to use maple tree register cache
Git-commit: ee8169f94985e5c88d2c4e9daed0b5f8345032b1
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9993 jsc#PED-10202

The maple tree register cache is based on a much more modern data structure
than the rbtree cache and makes optimisation choices which are probably
more appropriate for modern systems than those made by the rbtree cache. In
v6.5 it has also acquired the ability to generate multi-register writes in
sync operations, bringing performance up to parity with the rbtree cache
there.

Update the wm8737 driver to use the more modern data structure.

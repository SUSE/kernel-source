Subject: [PATCH] Revert "block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges"
Git-commit: ebc69e897e17373fbe1daaff1debaa77583a5284
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc4
References: stable-5.14.10

[ Upstream commit ebc69e897e17373fbe1daaff1debaa77583a5284 ]

This reverts commit 2d52c58b9c9bdae0ca3df6a1eab5745ab3f7d80b.

We have had several folks complain that this causes hangs for them, which
is especially problematic as the commit has also hit stable already.

As no resolution seems to be forthcoming right now, revert the patch.

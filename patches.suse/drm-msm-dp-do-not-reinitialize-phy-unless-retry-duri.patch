Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: do not reinitialize phy unless retry during link training
Git-commit: 0c1a2e69bcb506f48ebf94bd199bab0b93f66da2
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc6
References: git-fixes

DP PHY re-initialization done using dp_ctrl_reinitialize_mainlink() will
cause PLL unlocked initially and then PLL gets locked at the end of
initialization. PLL_UNLOCKED interrupt will fire during this time if the
interrupt mask is enabled.

However currently DP driver link training implementation incorrectly
re-initializes PHY unconditionally during link training as the PHY was
already configured in dp_ctrl_enable_mainlink_clocks().

Fix this by re-initializing the PHY only if the previous link training
failed.

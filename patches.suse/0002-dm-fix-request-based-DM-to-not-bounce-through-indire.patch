Subject: [PATCH] dm: fix request-based DM to not bounce through indirect
 dm_submit_bio
Git-commit: 681cc5e8667e8579a2da8fa4090c48a2d73fc3bb
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

It is unnecessary to force request-based DM to call into bio-based
dm_submit_bio (via indirect disk->fops->submit_bio) only to have it then
call blk_mq_submit_bio().

Fix this by establishing a request-based DM block_device_operations
(dm_rq_blk_dops, which doesn't have .submit_bio) and update
dm_setup_md_queue() to set md->disk->fops to it for
DM_TYPE_REQUEST_BASED.

Remove DM_TYPE_REQUEST_BASED conditional in dm_submit_bio and unexport
blk_mq_submit_bio.

(Coly Li: rebased for Linux v5.3 based SUSE kernel)

Fixes: c62b37d96b6eb ("block: move ->make_request_fn to struct block_device_operations")

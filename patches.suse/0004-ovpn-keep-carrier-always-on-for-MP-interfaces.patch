Subject: ovpn: keep carrier always on for MP interfaces
References: bsc#1239783
Git-repo: https://github.com/OpenVPN/ovpn-net-next.git
Git-commit: 191476368a01576ef614e37d73ae157bf00691b4
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository

An ovpn interface configured in MP mode will keep carrier always
on and let the user decide when to bring it administratively up and
down.

This way a MP node (i.e. a server) will keep its interface always
up and running, even when no peer is connected.

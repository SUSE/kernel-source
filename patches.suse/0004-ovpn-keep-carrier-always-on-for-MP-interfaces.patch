Subject: ovpn: keep carrier always on for MP interfaces
References: bsc#1239783
Git-repo: https://github.com/OpenVPN/ovpn-net-next.git
Git-commit: 0ec0174630aa38840b6709eca2ae81833f85ac79
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository

An ovpn interface configured in MP mode will keep carrier always
on and let the user decide when to bring it administratively up and
down.

This way a MP node (i.e. a server) will keep its interface always
up and running, even when no peer is connected.

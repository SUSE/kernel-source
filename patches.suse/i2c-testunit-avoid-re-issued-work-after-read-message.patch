Subject: [PATCH] i2c: testunit: avoid re-issued work after read message
Git-commit: 119736c7af442ab398dbb806865988c98ef60d46
Patch-mainline: v6.10
References: git-fixes

The to-be-fixed commit rightfully prevented that the registers will be
cleared. However, the index must be cleared. Otherwise a read message
will re-issue the last work. Fix it and add a comment describing the
situation.

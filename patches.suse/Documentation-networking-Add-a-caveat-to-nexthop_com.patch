Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: networking: Add a caveat to nexthop_compat_mode sysctl
Git-commit: bbe4b41259a3e255a16d795486d331c1670b4e75
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

net.ipv4.nexthop_compat_mode was added when nexthop objects were added to
provide the view of nexthop objects through the usual lens of the route
UAPI. As nexthop objects evolved, the information provided through this
lens became incomplete. For example, details of resilient nexthop groups
are obviously omitted.

Now that 16-bit nexthop group weights are a thing, the 8-bit UAPI cannot
convey the >8-bit weight accurately. Instead of inventing workarounds for
an obsolete interface, just document the expectations of inaccuracy.

Fixes: b72a6a7ab957 ("net: nexthop: Increase weight to u16")

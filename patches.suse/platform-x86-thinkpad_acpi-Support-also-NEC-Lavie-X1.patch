References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc7

Change get_thinkpad_model_data() to check for additional vendor name
"NEC" in order to support NEC Lavie X1475JAS notebook (and perhaps
more).

The reason of this works with minimal changes is because NEC Lavie
X1475JAS is a Thinkpad inside. ACPI dumps reveals its OEM ID to be
"LENOVO", BIOS version "R2PET30W" matches typical Lenovo BIOS version,
the existence of HKEY of LEN0268, with DMI fw string is "R2PHT24W".

I compiled and tested with my own machine, attached the dmesg
below as proof of work:

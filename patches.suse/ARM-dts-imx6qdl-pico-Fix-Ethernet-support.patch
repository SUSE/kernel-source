Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6qdl-pico: Fix Ethernet support
Git-commit: 450e7fe9b1b3c90eeed74a2fe0eeb13a7b57f3da
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc5
References: stable-5.14.12

[ Upstream commit 450e7fe9b1b3c90eeed74a2fe0eeb13a7b57f3da ]

Currently, it is no longer possible to retrieve a DHCP address
on the imx6qdl-pico board.

This issue has been exposed by commit f5d9aa79dfdf ("ARM: imx6q:
remove clk-out fixup for the Atheros AR8031 and AR8035 PHYs").

Fix it by describing the qca,clk-out-frequency property as suggested
by the commit above.

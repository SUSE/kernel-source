Subject: drm/doc/rfc: Mark DRM_VM_BIND as complete.
Git-commit: 3d06add933cc0ccb41cf4ba531216b144e12609f
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

The consensus is for individual drivers VM_BIND uapis with
the GPUVA helpers that are already implemented and merged
upstream.

The merged GPUVA documentation also establish some overall
rules for the locking to be followed by the drivers.

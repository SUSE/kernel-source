Subject: [PATCH 1/1] vsock: reset socket state when de-assigning the transport
Git-commit: a24009bc9be60242651a21702609381b5092459e
Patch-mainline: v6.13
References: git-fixes

Transport's release() and destruct() are called when de-assigning the
vsock transport. These callbacks can touch some socket state like
sock flags, sk_state, and peer_shutdown.

Since we are reassigning the socket to a new transport during
vsock_connect(), let's reset these fields to have a clean state with
the new transport.

Subject: [PATCH] nfsd: Fix error cleanup path in nfsd_rename()
Git-commit: 9fe6e9e7b58944037714442384075c17cfde1c56
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc2
References: bsc#1221044 CVE-2023-52591 CVE-2024-35914 bsc#1224482

Commit a8b0026847b8 ("rename(): avoid a deadlock in the case of parents
having no common ancestor") added an error bail out path. However this
path does not drop the remount protection that has been acquired. Fix
the cleanup path to properly drop the remount protection.

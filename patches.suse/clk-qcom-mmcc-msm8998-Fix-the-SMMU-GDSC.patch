Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: mmcc-msm8998: Fix the SMMU GDSC
Git-commit: 1fc62c8347397faf4e18249e88ecd4470c0a5357
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

The SMMU GDSC doesn't have to be ALWAYS-ON and shouldn't feature the
HW_CTRL flag (it's separate from hw_ctrl_addr).  In addition to that,
it should feature a cxc entry for bimc_smmu_axi_clk and be marked as
votable.

Fix all of these issues.

Subject: perf/x86/lbr: Enable the branch type for the Arch LBR by default
Git-commit: 32ba156df1b1c8804a4e5be5339616945eafea22
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc3
References: git fixes

On the platform with Arch LBR, the HW raw branch type encoding may leak
to the perf tool when the SAVE_TYPE option is not set.

In the intel_pmu_store_lbr(), the HW raw branch type is stored in
lbr_entries[].type. If the SAVE_TYPE option is set, the
lbr_entries[].type will be converted into the generic PERF_BR_* type
in the intel_pmu_lbr_filter() and exposed to the user tools.
But if the SAVE_TYPE option is NOT set by the user, the current perf
kernel doesn't clear the field. The HW raw branch type leaks.

There are two solutions to fix the issue for the Arch LBR.
One is to clear the field if the SAVE_TYPE option is NOT set.
The other solution is to unconditionally convert the branch type and
expose the generic type to the user tools.

The latter is implemented here, because
- The branch type is valuable information. I don't see a case where
  you would not benefit from the branch type. (Stephane Eranian)
- Not having the branch type DOES NOT save any space in the
  branch record (Stephane Eranian)
- The Arch LBR HW can retrieve the common branch types from the
  LBR_INFO. It doesn't require the high overhead SW disassemble.

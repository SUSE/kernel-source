Subject: scsi: sd: Fix system start for ATA devices
Git-commit: b09d7f8fd50f6e93cbadd8d27fde178f745b42a1
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc4
References: git-fixes

It is not always possible to keep a device in the runtime suspended state
when a system level suspend/resume cycle is executed. E.g. for ATA devices
connected to AHCI adapters, system resume resets the ATA ports, which
causes connected devices to spin up. In such case, a runtime suspended disk
will incorrectly be seen with a suspended runtime state because the device
is not resumed by sd_resume_system(). The power state seen by the user is
different than the actual device physical power state.

Fix this issue by introducing the struct scsi_device flag
force_runtime_start_on_system_start. When set, this flag causes
sd_resume_system() to request a runtime resume operation for runtime
suspended devices. This results in the user seeing the device runtime_state
as active after a system resume, thus correctly reflecting the device
physical power state.

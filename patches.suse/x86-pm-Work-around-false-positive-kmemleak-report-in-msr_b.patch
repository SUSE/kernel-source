Subject: x86/pm: Work around false positive kmemleak report in
 msr_build_context()
Git-commit: e3f269ed0accbb22aa8f25d2daffa23c3fccd407
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

Since:

  7ee18d677989 ("x86/power: Make restore_processor_context() sane")

kmemleak reports this issue:

  unreferenced object 0xf68241e0 (size 32):
    comm "swapper/0", pid 1, jiffies 4294668610 (age 68.432s)

      [<3b538fde>] kernel_init+0x1a/0x110
      [<938ae2b2>] ret_from_fork+0x1c/0x28

Which is a false positive.

Reproducer:

  - Run rsync of whole kernel tree (multiple times if needed).
  - start a kmemleak scan
  - Note this is just an example: a lot of our internal tests hit these.

The root cause is similar to the fix in:

  b0b592cf0836 x86/pm: Fix false positive kmemleak report in msr_build_context()

ie. the alignment within the packed struct saved_context
which has everything unaligned as there is only "u16 gs;" at start of
struct where in the past there were four u16 there thus aligning
everything afterwards.  The issue is with the fact that Kmemleak only
searches for pointers that are aligned (see how pointers are scanned in
kmemleak.c) so when the struct members are not aligned it doesn't see
them.

Testing:

We run a lot of tests with our CI, and after applying this fix we do not
see any kmemleak issues any more whilst without it we see hundreds of
the above report. From a single, simple test run consisting of 416 individual test
cases on kernel 5.10 x86 with kmemleak enabled we got 20 failures due to this,
which is quite a lot. With this fix applied we get zero kmemleak related failures.

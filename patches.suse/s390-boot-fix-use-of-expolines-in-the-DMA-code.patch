Subject: [PATCH] s390/boot: fix use of expolines in the DMA code

References: bsc#1188878 ltc#193771
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc3
Git-commit: 463f36c76fa4ec015c640ff63ccf52e7527abee0

Description:   s390/boot: fix use of expolines in the DMA code
Symptom:       No expolines are used in the DMA text section if the s390 kernel
               is built with expolines enabled.
Problem:       The DMA code section of the decompressor must be compiled with
               expolines if Spectre V2 mitigation has been enabled for
               the decompressed kernel. This is required because although
               the decompressor's image contains the DMA code section, it is
               handed over to the decompressed kernel for use.
Solution:      Because the DMA code is already slow w/o expolines, use
               expolines always regardless whether the decompressed kernel is
               using them or not. This simplifies the DMA code by dropping
               the conditional compilation of expolines.
Reproduction:  Build the s390 kernel with expolines enabled.


The DMA code section of the decompressor must be compiled with expolines
if Spectre V2 mitigation has been enabled for the decompressed kernel.
This is required because although the decompressor's image contains
the DMA code section, it is handed over to the decompressed kernel for use.

Because the DMA code is already slow w/o expolines, use expolines always
regardless whether the decompressed kernel is using them or not. This
simplifies the DMA code by dropping the conditional compilation of
expolines.

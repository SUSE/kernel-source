Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/net: fix sr->len for IORING_OP_RECV with MSG_WAITALL
 and buffers
Git-commit: 72bd80252feeb3bef8724230ee15d9f7ab541c6e
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc3
References: git-fixes

If we use IORING_OP_RECV with provided buffers and pass in '0' as the
length of the request, the length is retrieved from the selected buffer.
If MSG_WAITALL is also set and we get a short receive, then we may hit
the retry path which decrements sr->len and increments the buffer for
a retry. However, the length is still zero at this point, which means
that sr->len now becomes huge and import_ubuf() will cap it to
MAX_RW_COUNT and subsequently return -EFAULT for the range as a whole.

Fix this by always assigning sr->len once the buffer has been selected.

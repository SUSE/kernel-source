Subject: [PATCH] nvme-tcp: fix potential unbalanced freeze & unfreeze
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.11
Git-commit: 99dc264014d5aed66ee37ddf136a38b5a2b1b529

commit 99dc264014d5aed66ee37ddf136a38b5a2b1b529 upstream.

Move start_freeze into nvme_tcp_configure_io_queues(), and there is
at least two benefits:

1) fix unbalanced freeze and unfreeze, since re-connection work may
fail or be broken by removal

2) IO during error recovery can be failfast quickly because nvme fabrics
unquiesces queues after teardown.

One side-effect is that !mpath request may timeout during connecting
because of queue topo change, but that looks not one big deal:

1) same problem exists with current code base

2) compared with !mpath, mpath use case is dominant

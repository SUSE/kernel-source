Subject: [PATCH] bcachefs: fix incorrect usage of REQ_OP_FLUSH
References: bsc#1219346
Git-commit: 3e44f325f6f75078cdcd44cd337f517ba3650d05
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc2

REQ_OP_FLUSH is only for internal use in the blk-mq and request based
drivers. File systems and other block layer consumers must use
REQ_OP_WRITE | REQ_PREFLUSH as documented in
Documentation/block/writeback_cache_control.rst.

While REQ_OP_FLUSH appears to work for blk-mq drivers it does not
get the proper flush state machine handling, and completely fails
for any bio based drivers, including all the stacking drivers.  The
block layer will also get a check in 6.8 to reject this use case
entirely.

[Note: completely untested, but as this never got fixed since the
original bug report in November:

   https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218184

and the the discussion in December:

    https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231221053016.72cqcfg46vxwohcj@moria.home.lan/T/

this seems to be best way to force it]

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: net: xgmac_mdio: Remove unsupported "bus-frequency"
Git-commit: 15ca0518c1b36b86c832de54417b9b61b5f6a4c9
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

This property has never been supported by the driver. The kernel has
settled on "clock-frequency" as the standard name for this binding, so
once that is supported we will document that instead.

Fixes: 7f93c9d90f4d ("power/fsl: add MDIO dt binding for FMan")

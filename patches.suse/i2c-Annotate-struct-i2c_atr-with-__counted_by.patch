Subject: [PATCH] i2c: Annotate struct i2c_atr with __counted_by
Git-commit: 3a133a4e44554bb7af114f231db2f30f447417cc
References: jsc#PED-10702
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1

Prepare for the coming implementation by GCC and Clang of the __counted_by
attribute. Flexible array members annotated with __counted_by can have
their accesses bounds-checked at run-time checking via CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS
(for array indexing) and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE (for strcpy/memcpy-family
functions).

As found with Coccinelle[1], add __counted_by for struct i2c_atr.

Subject: [PATCH] media: tc358743: Increase FIFO trigger level to 374
Git-commit: 86addd25314a1e77dbdcfddfeed0bab2f27da0e2
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: stable-fixes

The existing fixed value of 16 worked for UYVY 720P60 over
2 lanes at 594MHz, or UYVY 1080P60 over 4 lanes. (RGB888
1080P60 needs 6 lanes at 594MHz).
It doesn't allow for lower resolutions to work as the FIFO
underflows.

374 is required for 1080P24 or 1080P30 UYVY over 2 lanes @
972Mbit/s, but >374 means that the FIFO underflows on 1080P50
UYVY over 2 lanes @ 972Mbit/s.

Whilst it would be nice to compute it, the required information
isn't published by Toshiba.

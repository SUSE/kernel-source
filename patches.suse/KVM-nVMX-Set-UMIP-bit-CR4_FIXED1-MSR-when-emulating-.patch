Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Set UMIP bit CR4_FIXED1 MSR when emulating UMIP

Make UMIP an "allowed-1" bit CR4_FIXED1 MSR when KVM is emulating UMIP.
KVM emulates UMIP for both L1 and L2, and so should enumerate that L2 is
allowed to have CR4.UMIP=1.  Not setting the bit doesn't immediately
break nVMX, as KVM does set/clear the bit in CR4_FIXED1 in response to a
guest CPUID update, i.e. KVM will correctly (dis)allow nested VM-Entry
based on whether or not UMIP is exposed to L1.  That said, KVM should
enumerate the bit as being allowed from time zero, e.g. userspace will
see the wrong value if the MSR is read before CPUID is written.

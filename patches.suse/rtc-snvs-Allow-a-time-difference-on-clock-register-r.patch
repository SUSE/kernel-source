Subject: [PATCH] rtc: snvs: Allow a time difference on clock register read
Git-commit: 0462681e207ccc44778a77b3297af728b1cf5b9f
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

On an iMX6ULL the following message appears when a wakealarm is set:

echo 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc1/wakealarm
rtc rtc1: Timeout trying to get valid LPSRT Counter read

This does not always happen but is reproducible quite often (7 out of 10
times). The problem appears because the iMX6ULL is not able to read the
registers within one 32kHz clock cycle which is the base clock of the
RTC. Therefore, this patch allows a difference of up to 320 cycles
(10ms). 10ms was chosen to be big enough even on systems with less cpu
power (e.g. iMX6ULL). According to the reference manual a difference is
Fine: 
- If the two consecutive reads are similar, the value is correct.
The values have to be similar, not equal.

Subject: [PATCH 4/5] mm/mempolicy: advertise new MPOL_PREFERRED_MANY
Git-commit: a38a59fdfa10be55d08e4530923d950e739ac6a2
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-23098

Adds a new mode to the existing mempolicy modes, MPOL_PREFERRED_MANY.

MPOL_PREFERRED_MANY will be adequately documented in the internal
admin-guide with this patch.  Eventually, the man pages for mbind(2),
get_mempolicy(2), set_mempolicy(2) and numactl(8) will also have text
about this mode.  Those shall contain the canonical reference.

NUMA systems continue to become more prevalent.  New technologies like
PMEM make finer grain control over memory access patterns increasingly
desirable.  MPOL_PREFERRED_MANY allows userspace to specify a set of nodes
that will be tried first when performing allocations.  If those
allocations fail, all remaining nodes will be tried.  It's a straight
forward API which solves many of the presumptive needs of system
administrators wanting to optimize workloads on such machines.  The mode
will work either per VMA, or per thread.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rt700-sdw: use first_hw_init flag on resume
Git-commit: a9e54e5fbe396b546771cf77b43ce7c75e212278
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

The intent of the status check on resume was to verify if a SoundWire
peripheral reported ATTACHED before waiting for the initialization to
complete. This is required to avoid timeouts that will happen with
'ghost' devices that are exposed in the platform firmware but are not
populated in hardware.

Unfortunately we used 'hw_init' instead of 'first_hw_init'. Due to
another error, the resume operation never timed out, but the volume
settings were not properly restored.

Subject: [PATCH] usb: cdc-acm: Fix handling of oversized fragments
Git-commit: 12e712964f41d05ae034989892de445781c46730
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc3
References: git-fixes

If we receive an initial fragment of size 8 bytes which specifies a wLength
of 1 byte (so the reassembled message is supposed to be 9 bytes long), and
we then receive a second fragment of size 9 bytes (which is not supposed to
happen), we currently wrongly bypass the fragment reassembly code but still
pass the pointer to the acm->notification_buffer to
acm_process_notification().

Make this less wrong by always going through fragment reassembly when we
expect more fragments.

Before this patch, receiving an overlong fragment could lead to `newctrl`
in acm_process_notification() being uninitialized data (instead of data
coming from the device).

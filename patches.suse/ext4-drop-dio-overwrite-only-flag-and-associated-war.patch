Subject: [PATCH] ext4: drop dio overwrite only flag and associated warning
Git-commit: 194505b55dd7899da114a4d47825204eefc0fff5
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: bsc#1215234

The commit referenced below opened up concurrent unaligned dio under
shared locking for pure overwrites. In doing so, it enabled use of
the IOMAP_DIO_OVERWRITE_ONLY flag and added a warning on unexpected
-EAGAIN returns as an extra precaution, since ext4 does not retry
writes in such cases. The flag itself is advisory in this case since
ext4 checks for unaligned I/Os and uses appropriate locking up
front, rather than on a retry in response to -EAGAIN.

As it turns out, the warning check is susceptible to false positives
because there are scenarios where -EAGAIN can be expected from lower
layers without necessarily having IOCB_NOWAIT set on the iocb. For
example, one instance of the warning has been seen where io_uring
sets IOCB_HIPRI, which in turn results in REQ_POLLED|REQ_NOWAIT on
the bio. This results in -EAGAIN if the block layer is unable to
allocate a request, etc. [Note that there is an outstanding patch to
untangle REQ_POLLED and REQ_NOWAIT such that the latter relies on
IOCB_NOWAIT, which would also address this instance of the warning.]

Another instance of the warning has been reproduced by syzbot. A dio
write is interrupted down in __get_user_pages_locked() waiting on
the mm lock and returns -EAGAIN up the stack. If the iomap dio
iteration layer has made no progress on the write to this point,
-EAGAIN returns up to the filesystem and triggers the warning.

This use of the overwrite flag in ext4 is precautionary and
half-baked. I.e., ext4 doesn't actually implement overwrite checking
in the iomap callbacks when the flag is set, so the only extra
verification it provides are i_size checks in the generic iomap dio
layer. Combined with the tendency for false positives, the added
verification is not worth the extra trouble. Remove the flag,
associated warning, and update the comments to document when
concurrent unaligned dio writes are allowed and why said flag is not
used.

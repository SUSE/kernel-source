Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Fix platform profiles on T490
Git-commit: 0c0cd3e25a5b64b541dd83ba6e032475a9d77432
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc2
References: git-fixes

I had incorrectly thought that PSC profiles were not usable on Intel
platforms so had blocked them in the driver initialistion. This broke
platform profiles on the T490.

After discussion with the FW team PSC does work on Intel platforms and
should be allowed.

Note - it's possible this may impact other platforms where it is advertised
but special driver support that only Windows has is needed. But if it does
then they will need fixing via quirks. Please report any issues to me so I
can get them addressed - but I haven't found any problems in testing...yet

Subject: libbpf: Change bpf_object_skeleton data field to const pointer
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
Git-commit: 08a6f22ef6f843d0ea7252087787b5ab04610bec
References: jsc#PED-1368

This change was necessary to enforce the implied contract
that bpf_object_skeleton->data should not be mutated.  The data
will be cast to `void *` during assignment to handle the case
where a user is compiling with older libbpf headers to avoid
a compiler warning of `const void *` data being cast to `void *`

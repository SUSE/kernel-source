Subject: NFSD: fix hang in nfsd4_shutdown_callback
Git-commit: 036ac2778f7b28885814c6fbc07e156ad1624d03
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc3
References: CVE-2025-21795 bsc#1238759

If nfs4_client is in courtesy state then there is no point to send
the callback. This causes nfsd4_shutdown_callback to hang since
cl_cb_inflight is not 0. This hang lasts about 15 minutes until TCP
notifies NFSD that the connection was dropped.

This patch modifies nfsd4_run_cb_work to skip the RPC call if
nfs4_client is in courtesy state.

Subject: ice: remove period on argument description in ice_for_each_vf
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
Git-commit: 4eaf1797bca19ed766dc3d7b607f0b0617214e7e
References: jsc#PED-376

The ice_for_each_vf macros have comments describing the implementation. One
of the arguments has a period on the end, which is not our typical style.
Remove the unnecessary period.

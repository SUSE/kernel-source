Subject: [PATCH] docs: i2c: i2c-topology: fix incorrect heading
Git-commit: 12c035a1a840e07a351c277d7a468269fa603000
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc5
References: git-fixes

"Etc" here was never meant to be a heading, it became one while converting
to ReST.

It would be easy to just convert it to plain text, but rather remove it and
add an introductory text before the list that conveys the same meaning but
with a better reading flow.

 There are a couple of reasons for building more complex I2C topologies

+Some example use cases are:

 1. A mux may be needed on the bus to prevent address collisions.

 These constructs are represented as I2C adapter trees by Linux, where
 each adapter has a parent adapter (except the root adapter) and zero or
 more child adapters. The root adapter is the actual adapter that issues

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Flush all EPTP/VPID contexts on remote TLB flush

Flush all EPTP/VPID contexts if a TLB flush _may_ have been triggered by
a remote or deferred TLB flush, i.e. by KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH.  Remote TLB
flushes require all contexts to be invalidated, not just the active
contexts, e.g. all mappings in all contexts for a given HVA need to be
invalidated on a mmu_notifier invalidation.  Similarly, the instigator
of the deferred TLB flush may be expecting all contexts to be flushed,
e.g. vmx_vcpu_load_vmcs().

Without nested VMX, flushing only the current EPTP/VPID context isn't
problematic because KVM uses a constant VPID for each vCPU, and
mmu_alloc_direct_roots() all but guarantees KVM will use a single EPTP
for L1.  In the rare case where a different EPTP is created or reused,
KVM (currently) unconditionally flushes the new EPTP context prior to
entering the guest.

With nested VMX, KVM conditionally uses a different VPID for L2, and
unconditionally uses a different EPTP for L2.  Because KVM doesn't
_intentionally_ guarantee L2's EPTP/VPID context is flushed on nested
VM-Enter, it'd be possible for a malicious L1 to attack the host and/or
different VMs by exploiting the lack of flushing for L2.

  1) Launch nested guest from malicious L1.

  2) Nested VM-Enter to L2.

  3) Access target GPA 'g'.  CPU inserts TLB entry tagged with L2's ASID
     mapping 'g' to host PFN 'x'.

  2) Nested VM-Exit to L1.

  3) L1 triggers kernel same-page merging (ksm) by duplicating/zeroing
     the page for PFN 'x'.

  4) Host kernel merges PFN 'x' with PFN 'y', i.e. unmaps PFN 'x' and
     remaps the page to PFN 'y'.  mmu_notifier sends invalidate command,
     KVM flushes TLB only for L1's ASID.

  4) Host kernel reallocates PFN 'x' to some other task/guest.

  5) Nested VM-Enter to L2.  KVM does not invalidate L2's EPTP or VPID.

  6) L2 accesses GPA 'g' and gains read/write access to PFN 'x' via its
     stale TLB entry.

However, current KVM unconditionally flushes L1's EPTP/VPID context on
nested VM-Exit.  But, that behavior is mostly unintentional, KVM doesn't
go out of its way to flush EPTP/VPID on nested VM-Enter/VM-Exit, rather
a TLB flush is guaranteed to occur prior to re-entering L1 due to
__kvm_mmu_new_cr3() always being called with skip_tlb_flush=false.  On
nested VM-Enter, this happens via kvm_init_shadow_ept_mmu() (nested EPT
enabled) or in nested_vmx_load_cr3() (nested EPT disabled).  On nested
VM-Exit it occurs via nested_vmx_load_cr3().

This also fixes a bug where a deferred TLB flush in the context of L2,
with EPT disabled, would flush L1's VPID instead of L2's VPID, as
vmx_flush_tlb() flushes L1's VPID regardless of is_guest_mode().

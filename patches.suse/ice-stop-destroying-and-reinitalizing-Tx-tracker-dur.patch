Subject: ice: stop destroying and reinitalizing Tx tracker during reset
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
Git-commit: 7a25fe5cd5fb2265065ac6765c53c0a1f1e874d3
References: jsc#PED-9947

The ice driver currently attempts to destroy and re-initialize the Tx
timestamp tracker during the reset flow. The release of the Tx tracker
only happened during CORE reset or GLOBAL reset. The ice_ptp_rebuild()
function always calls the ice_ptp_init_tx function which will allocate
a new tracker data structure, resulting in memory leaks during PF reset.

Certainly the driver should not be allocating a new tracker without
removing the old tracker data, as this results in a memory leak.
Additionally, there's no reason to remove the tracker memory during a
reset. Remove this logic from the reset and rebuild flow. Instead of
releasing the Tx tracker, flush outstanding timestamps just before we
reset the PHY timestamp block in ice_ptp_cfg_phy_interrupt().

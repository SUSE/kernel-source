Subject: [PATCH] thunderbolt: Fix connection issue with Pluggable UD-4VPD dock
Git-commit: bd646c768a934d28e574ee940d6759c7954a024d
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc7
References: git-fixes

Rick reported that his Pluggable USB4 dock does not work anymore after
upgrading to v6.10 kernel.

It looks like commit c6ca1ac9f472 ("thunderbolt: Increase sideband
access polling delay") makes the device router enumeration happen later
than what might be expected by the dock (although there is no such limit
in the USB4 spec) which probably makes it assume there is something
wrong with the high-speed link and reset it. After the link is reset the
same issue happens again and again.

For this reason lower the sideband access delay from 5ms to 1ms. This
seems to work fine according to Rick's testing.

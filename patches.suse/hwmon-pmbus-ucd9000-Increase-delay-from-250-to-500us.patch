Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (pmbus/ucd9000) Increase delay from 250 to 500us
Git-commit: 26e8383b116d0dbe74e28f86646563ab46d66d83
Patch-mainline: v6.9
References: git-fixes

Following the failure observed with a delay of 250us, experiments were
conducted with various delays. It was found that a delay of 350us
effectively mitigated the issue.

To provide a more optimal solution while still allowing a margin for
stability, the delay is being adjusted to 500us.

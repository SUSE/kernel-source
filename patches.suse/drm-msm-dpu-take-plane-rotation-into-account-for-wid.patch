Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dpu: take plane rotation into account for wide planes
Git-commit: d3a785e4f983f523380e023d8a05fb6d04402957
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc5
References: git-fixes

Take into account the plane rotation and flipping when calculating src
positions for the wide plane parts.

This is not an issue yet, because rotation is only supported for the
UBWC planes and wide UBWC planes are rejected anyway because in parallel
multirect case only the half of the usual width is supported for tiled
formats. However it's better to fix this now rather than stumbling upon
it later.

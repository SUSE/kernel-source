Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtlwifi: Drastically reduce the attempts to read efuse in case of failures
Git-commit: 5c1b544563005a00591a3aa86ecff62ed4d11be3
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: stable-fixes CVE-2024-53190 bsc#1234950

Syzkaller reported a hung task with uevent_show() on stack trace. That
specific issue was addressed by another commit [0], but even with that
fix applied (for example, running v6.12-rc5) we face another type of hung
task that comes from the same reproducer [1]. By investigating that, we
could narrow it to the following path:

(a) Syzkaller emulates a Realtek USB WiFi adapter using raw-gadget and
dummy_hcd infrastructure.

(b) During the probe of rtl8192cu, the driver ends-up performing an efuse
read procedure (which is related to EEPROM load IIUC), and here lies the
Issue: the function read_efuse() calls read_efuse_byte() many times, as
loop iterations depending on the efuse size (in our example, 512 in total).

This procedure for reading efuse bytes relies in a loop that performs an
I/O read up to *10k* times in case of failures. We measured the time of
the loop inside read_efuse_byte() alone, and in this reproducer (which
involves the dummy_hcd emulation layer), it takes 15 seconds each. As a
consequence, we have the driver stuck in its probe routine for big time,
exposing a stack trace like below if we attempt to reboot the system, for
Example:

 [...]

We propose hereby to drastically reduce the attempts of doing the I/O
reads in case of failures, restricted to USB devices (given that
they're inherently slower than PCIe ones). By retrying up to 10 times
(instead of 10000), we got reponsiveness in the reproducer, while seems
reasonable to believe that there's no sane USB device implementation in
the field requiring this amount of retries at every I/O read in order
to properly work. Based on that assumption, it'd be good to have it
backported to stable but maybe not since driver implementation (the 10k
number comes from day 0), perhaps up to 6.x series makes sense.

[1] A note about that: this syzkaller report presents multiple reproducers
that differs by the type of emulated USB device. For this specific case,
check the entry from 2024/08/08 06:23 in the list of crashes; the C repro
is available at https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproC&x=1521fc83980000.

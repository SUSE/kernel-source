Subject: [PATCH] pwm: imx-tpm: force 'real_period' to be zero in suspend

References: git-fixes

During suspend, all the tpm registers will lose values.
So the 'real_period' value of struct 'imx_tpm_pwm_chip'
should be forced to be zero to force the period update
code can be executed after system resume back.

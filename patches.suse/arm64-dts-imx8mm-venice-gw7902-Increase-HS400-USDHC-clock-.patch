Subject: arm64: dts: imx8mm-venice-gw7902: Increase HS400 USDHC clock speed
Git-commit: abc467727773996f40e9eacb963ae9f441db40be
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

The IMX8M reference manuals indicate in the USDHC Clock generator section
that the clock rate for DDR is 1/2 the input clock therefore HS400 rates
clocked at 200Mhz require a 400Mhz SDHC clock.

This showed about a 1.5x improvement in read performance for the eMMC's
used on the various imx8m{m,n,p}-venice boards.

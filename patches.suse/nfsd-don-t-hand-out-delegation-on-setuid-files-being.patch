Subject: [PATCH] nfsd: don't hand out delegation on setuid files being opened
 for write
Git-commit: 826b67e6376c2a788e3a62c4860dcd79500a27d5
Patch-mainline: v6.3
References: git-fixes

We had a bug report that xfstest generic/355 was failing on NFSv4.0.
This test sets various combinations of setuid/setgid modes and tests
whether DIO writes will cause them to be stripped.

What I found was that the server did properly strip those bits, but
the client didn't notice because it held a delegation that was not
recalled. The recall didn't occur because the client itself was the
one generating the activity and we avoid recalls in that case.

Clearing setuid bits is an "implicit" activity. The client didn't
specifically request that we do that, so we need the server to issue a
CB_RECALL, or avoid the situation entirely by not issuing a delegation.

The easiest fix here is to simply not give out a delegation if the file
is being opened for write, and the mode has the setuid and/or setgid bit
set. Note that there is a potential race between the mode and lease
being set, so we test for this condition both before and after setting
the lease.

This patch fixes generic/355, generic/683 and generic/684 for me. (Note
that 355 fails only on v4.0, and 683 and 684 require NFSv4.2 to run and
fail).

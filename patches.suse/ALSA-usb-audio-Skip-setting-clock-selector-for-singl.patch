Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Skip setting clock selector for single connections
Git-commit: 67794f882adca00d043899ac248bc002751da9f6
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc3
References: stable-fixes

Since commit 086b957cc17f5 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Skip the clock selector
inquiry for single connections") we are already skipping clock selector
inquiry if only one clock source is connected, but we are still sending
a set request. Lets skip that too.

This should fix errors when setting a sample rate on devices that don't
have any controls present within the clock selector. An example of such
device is the new revision of MOTU M Series (07fd:000b):

      AudioControl Interface Descriptor:
        bLength                 8
        bDescriptorType        36
        bDescriptorSubtype     11 (CLOCK_SELECTOR)
        bClockID                1
        bNrInPins               1
        baCSourceID(0)          2
        bmControls           0x00
        iClockSelector          0

Perhaps we also should check if clock selectors are readable and writeable
like we already do for clock sources, but this is out of scope of this
patch.

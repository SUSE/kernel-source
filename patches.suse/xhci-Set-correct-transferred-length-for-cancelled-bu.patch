Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Set correct transferred length for cancelled bulk transfers
Git-commit: f0260589b439e2637ad54a2b25f00a516ef28a57
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc4
References: stable-fixes

The transferred length is set incorrectly for cancelled bulk
transfer TDs in case the bulk transfer ring stops on the last transfer
block with a 'Stop - Length Invalid' completion code.

length essentially ends up being set to the requested length:
urb->actual_length = urb->transfer_buffer_length

Length for 'Stop - Length Invalid' cases should be the sum of all
TRB transfer block lengths up to the one the ring stopped on,
_excluding_ the one stopped on.

Fix this by always summing up TRB lengths for 'Stop - Length Invalid'
bulk cases.

This issue was discovered by Alan Stern while debugging
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218890, but does not
solve that bug. Issue is older than 4.10 kernel but fix won't apply
to those due to major reworks in that area.

Subject: [PATCH 1/9] bfq: Avoid false marking of bic as stably merged
References: bsc#1197926
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
Git-commit: 70456e5210f40ffdb8f6d905acfdcec5bd5fad9e

bfq_setup_cooperator() can mark bic as stably merged even though it
decides to not merge its bfqqs (when bfq_setup_merge() returns NULL).
Make sure to mark bic as stably merged only if we are really going to
merge bfqqs.

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: dwc: Ensure that dw_pcie_wait_for_link() waits 100 ms after link up
Git-commit: 80dc18a0cba8dea42614f021b20a04354b213d86
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: stable-fixes

As per PCIe r6.0, sec 6.6.1, a Downstream Port that supports Link speeds
greater than 5.0 GT/s, software must wait a minimum of 100 ms after Link
training completes before sending a Configuration Request.

Add this delay in dw_pcie_wait_for_link(), after the link is reported as
up. The delay will only be performed in the success case where the link
came up.

DWC glue drivers that have a link up IRQ (drivers that set
use_linkup_irq = true) do not call dw_pcie_wait_for_link(), instead they
perform this delay in their threaded link up IRQ handler.

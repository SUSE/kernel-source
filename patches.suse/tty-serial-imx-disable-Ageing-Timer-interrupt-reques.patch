Subject: [PATCH] tty: serial: imx: disable Ageing Timer interrupt request irq

There maybe pending USR interrupt before requesting irq, however
uart_add_one_port has not executed, so there will be kernel panic:

The issue only happends in the inmate linux when Jailhouse hypervisor
enabled. The test procedure is:
while true; do
	jailhouse enable imx8mp.cell
	jailhouse cell linux xxxx
	sleep 10
	jailhouse cell destroy 1
	jailhouse disable
	sleep 5
done

And during the upper test, press keys to the 2nd linux console.
When `jailhouse cell destroy 1`, the 2nd linux has no chance to put
the uart to a quiese state, so USR1/2 may has pending interrupts. Then
when `jailhosue cell linux xx` to start 2nd linux again, the issue
trigger.

In order to disable irqs before requesting them, both UCR1 and UCR2 irqs
should be disabled, so here fix that, disable the Ageing Timer interrupt
in UCR2 as UCR1 does.

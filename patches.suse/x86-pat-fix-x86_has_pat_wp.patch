Subject: x86/pat: Fix x86_has_pat_wp()
Git-commit: 230ec83d4299b30c51a1c133b4f2a669972cc08a
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7
References: git-fixes

x86_has_pat_wp() is using a wrong test, as it relies on the normal
PAT configuration used by the kernel. In case the PAT MSR has been
setup by another entity (e.g. Xen hypervisor) it might return false
even if the PAT configuration is allowing WP mappings. This due to the
fact that when running as Xen PV guest the PAT MSR is setup by the
hypervisor and cannot be changed by the guest. This results in the WP
related entry to be at a different position when running as Xen PV
guest compared to the bare metal or fully virtualized case.

The correct way to test for WP support is:

1. Get the PTE protection bits needed to select WP mode by reading
   __cachemode2pte_tbl[_PAGE_CACHE_MODE_WP] (depending on the PAT MSR
   setting this might return protection bits for a stronger mode, e.g.
   UC-)
2. Translate those bits back into the real cache mode selected by those
   PTE bits by reading __pte2cachemode_tbl[__pte2cm_idx(prot)]
3. Test for the cache mode to be _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_WP

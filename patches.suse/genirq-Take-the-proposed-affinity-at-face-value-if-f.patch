Subject: genirq: Take the proposed affinity at face value if force==true
Git-commit: c48c8b829d2b966a6649827426bcdba082ccf922
Patch-mainline: 5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Although setting the affinity of an interrupt to a set of CPUs that doesn't
have any online CPU is generally frowned apon, there are a few limited
cases where such affinity is set from a CPUHP notifier, setting the
affinity to a CPU that isn't online yet.

The saving grace is that this is always done using the 'force' attribute,
which gives a hint that the affinity setting can be outside of the online
CPU mask and the callsite set this flag with the knowledge that the
underlying interrupt controller knows to handle it.

This restores the expected behaviour on Marek's system.

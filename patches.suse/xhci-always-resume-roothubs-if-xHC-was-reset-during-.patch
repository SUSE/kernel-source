Subject: [PATCH] xhci: always resume roothubs if xHC was reset during resume
Git-commit: 79989bd4ab86404743953fa382af0a22900050cf
Patch-mainline: v6.10
References: stable-fixes

Usb device connect may not be detected after runtime resume if
xHC is reset during resume.

In runtime resume cases xhci_resume() will only resume roothubs if there
are pending port events. If the xHC host is reset during runtime resume
due to a Save/Restore Error (SRE) then these pending port events won't be
detected as PORTSC change bits are not immediately set by host after reset.

Unconditionally resume roothubs if xHC is reset during resume to ensure
device connections are detected.

Also return early with error code if starting xHC fails after reset.

Issue was debugged and a similar solution suggested by Remi Pommarel.
Using this instead as it simplifies future refactoring.

Subject: nvme: explicitly set non-error for directives
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
Git-commit: 1c3adf0de1db86cf354dcb1a2dd1184e5e63a50a
References: jsc#PED-1183

Stream directives is an optional feature. It is not an error if a
controller doesn't support as many as the kernel can optionally use.
Explicitly set the non-error return value on this condition with a
comment explaining why.

Note, the return value was already 0 in this condition, so the setting
is redundant. This patch should just silence bots that falsely believe
the condition contains an error omission.

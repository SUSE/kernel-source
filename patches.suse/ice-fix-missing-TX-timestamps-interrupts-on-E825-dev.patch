Subject: ice: fix missing TX timestamps interrupts on E825 devices
Patch-mainline: v6.19
Git-commit: 99854c167cfc113ad863832b1601c4ca1a639cfe
References: jsc#PED-14404 jsc#PED-15079

Modify PTP (Precision Time Protocol) configuration on link down flow.
Previously, PHY_REG_TX_OFFSET_READY register was cleared in such case.
This register is used to determine if the timestamp is valid or not on
the hardware side.
However, there is a possibility that there is still the packet in the
HW queue which originally was supposed to be timestamped but the link
is already down and given register is cleared.
This potentially might lead to the situation in which that 'delayed'
packet's timestamp is treated as invalid one when the link is up
again.
This in turn leads to the situation in which the driver is not able to
effectively clean timestamp memory and interrupt configuration.
From the hardware perspective, that 'old' interrupt was not handled
properly and even if new timestamp packets are processed, no new
interrupts is generated. As a result, providing timestamps to the user
applications (like ptp4l) is not possible.
The solution for this problem is implemented at the driver level rather
than the firmware, and maintains the tx_ready bit high, even during
link down events. This avoids entering a potential inconsistent state
between the driver and the timestamp hardware.

Testing hints:
- run PTP traffic at higher rate (like 16 PTP messages per second)
- observe ptp4l behaviour at the client side in the following
  conditions:
	a) trigger link toggle events. It needs to be physiscal
           link down/up events
	b) link speed change
In all above cases, PTP processing at ptp4l application should resume
always. In failure case, the following permanent error message in ptp4l
log was observed:
controller-0 ptp4l: err [6175.116] ptp4l-legacy timed out while polling
	for tx timestamp

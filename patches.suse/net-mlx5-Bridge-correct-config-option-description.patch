Subject: net/mlx5: Bridge, correct config option description
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
Git-commit: 3fe090ad025082556491604a4761cad87d7529da
References: jsc#PED-14197 jsc#PED-14199 jsc#PED-15315

The implication of the previous help text was that without this option
enabled, representor devices couldn't be added to a bridge device, while
in fact that was possible, just that rules didn't get offloaded to hw.

This commit clarifies the help text.

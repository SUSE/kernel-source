Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: pci: Change DMI match info to support all Chrome platforms
Git-commit: c1c1fc8103f794a10c5c15e3c17879caf4f42c8f
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

In some Chrome platforms if OEM's use their own string as SYS_VENDOR than
"Google", it leads to firmware load failure from intel/sof/community path.

Hence, changing SYS_VENDOR to PRODUCT_FAMILY in which "Google" is used
as common prefix and is supported in all Chrome platforms.

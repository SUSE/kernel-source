Subject: [PATCH] dm-delay: fix a race between delay_presuspend and delay_bio
Git-commit: 6fc45b6ed921dc00dfb264dc08c7d67ee63d2656
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc2
References: git-fixes

In delay_presuspend, we set the atomic variable may_delay and then stop
the timer and flush pending bios. The intention here is to prevent the
delay target from re-arming the timer again.

However, this test is racy. Suppose that one thread goes to delay_bio,
sees that dc->may_delay is one and proceeds; now, another thread executes
delay_presuspend, it sets dc->may_delay to zero, deletes the timer and
flushes pending bios. Then, the first thread continues and adds the bio to
delayed->list despite the fact that dc->may_delay is false.

Fix this bug by changing may_delay's type from atomic_t to bool and
only access it while holding the delayed_bios_lock mutex. Note that we
don't have to grab the mutex in delay_resume because there are no bios
in flight at this point.

(Coly Li: rebased for Linux 5.14 based SUSE kernel, by still keeping
 dc->may_delay as atomic_t and only adding delayed_bios_lock protection
 as original patch does.)

Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: Remove spurious error message
Git-commit: 1c58e933aba23f68c0d3f192f7cc6eed8fabd694
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

Even with rate limited reporting this is very spammy and since
it is remote device that is providing bogus data there is no
need to report this as error.

Since real_len variable was used only to allow conditional error
message it is now also removed.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: hp_wmi: Fix rfkill causing soft blocked wifi
Git-commit: 1598bfa8e1faa932de42e1ee7628a1c4c4263f0a
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc5
References: git-fixes

After upgrading BIOS to U82 01.02.01 Rev.A, the console is flooded
strange char "^@" which printed out every second and makes login
nearly impossible. Also the below messages were shown both in console
and journal/dmesg every second:

usb 1-3: Device not responding to setup address.
usb 1-3: device not accepting address 4, error -71
usb 1-3: device descriptor read/all, error -71
usb usb1-port3: unable to enumerate USB device

Wifi is soft blocked by checking rfkill. When unblocked manually,
after few seconds it would be soft blocked again. So I was suspecting
something triggered rfkill to soft block wifi.  At the end it was
fixed by removing hp_wmi module.

The root cause is the way hp-wmi driver handles command 1B on
post-2009 BIOS.  In pre-2009 BIOS, command 1Bh return 0x4 to indicate
that BIOS no longer controls the power for the wireless devices.

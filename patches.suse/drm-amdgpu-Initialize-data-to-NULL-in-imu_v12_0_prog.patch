Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdgpu: Initialize data to NULL in imu_v12_0_program_rlc_ram()
Git-commit: c90f2e1172c51fa25492471dc9910e2d7c1444b9
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

After a recent change in clang to expose uninitialized warnings from
const variables and pointers [1], there is a warning in
imu_v12_0_program_rlc_ram() because data is passed uninitialized to
Program_imu_rlc_ram(): 

  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/imu_v12_0.c:374:30: error: variable 'data' is uninitialized when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
    374 |                         program_imu_rlc_ram(adev, data, (const u32)size);
        |                                                   ^~~~

As this warning happens early in clang's frontend, it does not realize
that due to the assignment of r to -EINVAL, program_imu_rlc_ram() is
never actually called, and even if it were, data would not be
dereferenced because size is 0.

Just initialize data to NULL to silence the warning, as the commit that
added program_imu_rlc_ram() mentioned it would eventually be used over
the old method, at which point data can be properly initialized and
used.

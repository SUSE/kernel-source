Subject: scsi: ufs: qcom: Add a readl() to make sure ref_clk gets enabled
Git-commit: 8eecddfca30e1651dc1c74531ed5eef21dcce7e3
Patch-mainline: v5.18 or v5.18-rc8 (next release)
References: git-fixes

In ufs_qcom_dev_ref_clk_ctrl(), it was noted that the ref_clk needs to be
stable for at least 1us. Even though there is wmb() to make sure the write
gets "completed", there is no guarantee that the write actually reached the
UFS device. There is a good chance that the write could be stored in a
Write Buffer (WB). In that case, even though the CPU waits for 1us, the
ref_clk might not be stable for that period.

So lets do a readl() to make sure that the previous write has reached the
UFS device before udelay().

Also, the wmb() after writel_relaxed() is not really needed. Both writel()
and readl() are ordered on all architectures and the CPU won't speculate
instructions after readl() due to the in-built control dependency with read
value on weakly ordered architectures. So it can be safely removed.

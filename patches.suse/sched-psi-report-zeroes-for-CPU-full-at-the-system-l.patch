Subject: [PATCH] sched/psi: report zeroes for CPU full at the system level
Git-commit: 890d550d7dbac7a31ecaa78732aa22be282bb6b8
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Martin find it confusing when look at the /proc/pressure/cpu output,
and found no hint about that CPU "full" line in psi Documentation.

% cat /proc/pressure/cpu
some avg10=0.92 avg60=0.91 avg300=0.73 total=933490489
full avg10=0.22 avg60=0.23 avg300=0.16 total=358783277

The PSI_CPU_FULL state is introduced by commit e7fcd7622823
("psi: Add PSI_CPU_FULL state"), which mainly for cgroup level,
but also counted at the system level as a side effect.

Naturally, the FULL state doesn't exist for the CPU resource at
the system level. These "full" numbers can come from CPU idle
schedule latency. For example, t1 is the time when task wakeup
on an idle CPU, t2 is the time when CPU pick and switch to it.
The delta of (t2 - t1) will be in CPU_FULL state.

Another case all processes can be stalled is when all cgroups
have been throttled at the same time, which unlikely to happen.

Anyway, CPU_FULL metric is meaningless and confusing at the
system level. So this patch will report zeroes for CPU full
at the system level, and update psi Documentation accordingly.

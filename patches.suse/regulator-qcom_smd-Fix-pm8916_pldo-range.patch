Subject: [PATCH] regulator: qcom_smd: Fix pm8916_pldo range
Git-commit: e8977917e116d1571dacb8e9864474551c1c12bd
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

The PM8916 device specification [1] documents a programmable range of
1.75V to 3.337V with 12.5mV steps for the PMOS LDOs in PM8916. This
range is also used when controlling the regulator directly using the
qcom_spmi-regulator driver ("ult_pldo" there).

However, for some reason the qcom_smd-regulator driver allows a much
larger range for the same hardware component. This could be simply a
typo, since the start of the range is essentially just missing a '1'.

In practice this does not cause any major problems, since the driver
just sends the actual voltage to the RPM firmware instead of making use
of the incorrect voltage selector. Still, having the wrong range there
is confusing and prevents the regulator core from validating requests
correctly.

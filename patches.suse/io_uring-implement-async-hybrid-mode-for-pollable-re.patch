Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: implement async hybrid mode for pollable requests
Git-commit: 90fa02883f063b971ebfd9f5b2184b38b83b7ee3
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsc#1205205

The current logic of requests with IOSQE_ASYNC is first queueing it to
io-worker, then execute it in a synchronous way. For unbound works like
pollable requests(e.g. read/write a socketfd), the io-worker may stuck
there waiting for events for a long time. And thus other works wait in
the list for a long time too.
Let's introduce a new way for unbound works (currently pollable
requests), with this a request will first be queued to io-worker, then
executed in a nonblock try rather than a synchronous way. Failure of
that leads it to arm poll stuff and then the worker can begin to handle
other works.
The detail process of this kind of requests is:

step1: original context:
           queue it to io-worker
step2: io-worker context:
           nonblock try(the old logic is a synchronous try here)
               |
               |--fail--> arm poll
                            |
                            |--(fail/ready)-->synchronous issue
                            |
                            |--(succeed)-->worker finish it's job, tw
                                           take over the req

This works much better than the old IOSQE_ASYNC logic in cases where
unbound max_worker is relatively small. In this case, number of
io-worker eazily increments to max_worker, new worker cannot be created
and running workers stuck there handling old works in IOSQE_ASYNC mode.

In my 64-core machine, set unbound max_worker to 20, run echo-server,
turns out:
(arguments: register_file, connetion number is 1000, message size is 12
Byte)
original IOSQE_ASYNC: 76664.151 tps
after this patch: 166934.985 tps

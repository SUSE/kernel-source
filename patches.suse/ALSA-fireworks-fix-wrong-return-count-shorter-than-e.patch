Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: fireworks: fix wrong return count shorter than expected by 4 bytes
Git-commit: eb9d84b0ffe39893cb23b0b6712bbe3637fa25fa
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc6
References: git-fixes

ALSA fireworks driver has a bug in its initial state to return count
shorter than expected by 4 bytes to userspace applications when handling
response frame for Echo Audio Fireworks transaction. It's due to missing
addition of the size for the type of event in ALSA firewire stack.

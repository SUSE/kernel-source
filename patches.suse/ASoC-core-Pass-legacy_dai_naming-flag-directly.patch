Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: core: Pass legacy_dai_naming flag directly
Git-commit: 8c8a0f01c7c52f9037b6859ff5234ea5acf572d6
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-850

Passing the result of the helper function snd_soc_component_is_codec
to snd_soc_register_dai is less clear than just passing the DAI
naming flag directly. snd_soc_register_dai wants to know if it
should use the legacy DAI naming. The CODEC distinction is more
of a historical thing and not obviously directly related, and there
are already a couple of CPU side components that explicitly opt in
to non-legacy DAI naming.

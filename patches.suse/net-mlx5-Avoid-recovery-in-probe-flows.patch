Subject: net/mlx5: Avoid recovery in probe flows
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc3
Git-commit: 9078e843efec530f279a155f262793c58b0746bd
References: jsc#PED-1549 bsc#1211794

Currently, recovery is done without considering whether the device is
still in probe flow.
This may lead to recovery before device have finished probed
successfully. e.g.: while mlx5_init_one() is running. Recovery flow is
using functionality that is loaded only by mlx5_init_one(), and there
is no point in running recovery without mlx5_init_one() finished
successfully.

Fix it by waiting for probe flow to finish and checking whether the
device is probed before trying to perform recovery.

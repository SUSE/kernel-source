Subject: x86/fpu: Provide struct fpu_config
Git-commit: 578971f4e228f386ad4d7ce16e979f2ed922de54
Patch-mainline: v5.15 or v5.15-rc8 (next release)
References: jsc#SLE-18931

Provide a struct to store information about the maximum supported and the
default feature set and buffer sizes for both user and kernel space.

This allows quick retrieval of this information for the upcoming support
for dynamically enabled features.

 [ bp: Add vertical spacing between the struct members. ]

Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/dp: Fix error handling during 128b/132b link training
Git-commit: b9275eabe31e6679ae12c46a4a0a18d622db4570
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc4
Alt-commit: 8b4bbaf8ddc1f68f3ee96a706f65fdb1bcd9d355
References: stable-fixes

At the end of a 128b/132b link training sequence, the HW expects the
transcoder training pattern to be set to TPS2 and from that to normal
mode (disabling the training pattern). Transitioning from TPS1 directly
to normal mode leaves the transcoder in a stuck state, resulting in
page-flip timeouts later in the modeset sequence.

Atm, in case of a failure during link training, the transcoder may be
still set to output the TPS1 pattern. Later the transcoder is then set
from TPS1 directly to normal mode in intel_dp_stop_link_train(), leading
to modeset failures later as described above. Fix this by setting the
training patter to TPS2, if the link training failed at any point.

The clue in the specification about the above HW behavior is the
explicit mention that TPS2 must be set after the link training sequence
(and there isn't a similar requirement specified for the 8b/10b link
training), see the Bspec links below.

V2: Add bspec aspect/link to the commit log. (Jani)

Subject: [PATCH] drm/panic: fix overindented list items in documentation
Git-commit: cba3b86974a3388b12130654809e50cd19294849
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc7
References: git-fixes

Starting with the upcoming Rust 1.86.0 (to be released 2025-04-03),
Clippy warns:

    error: doc list item overindented
       --> drivers/gpu/drm/drm_panic_qr.rs:914:5
        |
    914 | ///    will be encoded as binary segment, otherwise it will be encoded
        |     ^^^ help: try using `  ` (2 spaces)
        |
        = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#doc_overindented_list_items

The overindentation is slightly hard to notice, since all the items
start with a backquote that makes it look OK, but it is there.

Thus fix it.

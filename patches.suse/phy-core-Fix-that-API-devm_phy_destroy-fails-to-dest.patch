Subject: [PATCH] phy: core: Fix that API devm_phy_destroy() fails to destroy the phy
Git-commit: 4dc48c88fcf82b89fdebd83a906aaa64f40fb8a9
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc5
References: git-fixes

For devm_phy_destroy(), its comment says it needs to invoke phy_destroy()
to destroy the phy, but it will not actually invoke the function since
devres_destroy() does not call devm_phy_consume(), and the missing
phy_destroy() call will cause that the phy fails to be destroyed.

Fortunately, the faulty API has not been used by current kernel tree.
Fix by using devres_release() instead of devres_destroy() within the API.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: cfg80211: avoid nontransmitted BSS list corruption
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Patch-mainline: Not yet, embargoed
References: CVE-2022-42721 bsc#1204060

If a non-transmitted BSS shares enough information (both
SSID and BSSID!) with another non-transmitted BSS of a
different AP, then we can find and update it, and then
try to add it to the non-transmitted BSS list. We do a
search for it on the transmitted BSS, but if it's not
there (but belongs to another transmitted BSS), the list
gets corrupted.

Since this is an erroneous situation, simply fail the
list insertion in this case and free the non-transmitted
BSS.

This fixes CVE-2022-42721.

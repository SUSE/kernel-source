Subject: [PATCH 1/3] crypto: drbg - ignore jitterentropy errors if not in FIPS
 mode
References: jsc#SLE-21132,bsc#1191259
Patch-mainline: Submitted, linux-crypto ML

A subsequent patch will make the jitterentropy RNG to unconditionally
report health test errors back to callers, independent of whether
fips_enabled is set or not. The DRBG needs access to a functional
jitterentropy instance only in FIPS mode (because it's the only SP800-90B
compliant entropy source as it currently stands). Thus, it is perfectly
fine for the DRBGs to obtain entropy from the jitterentropy source only
on a best effort basis if fips_enabled is off.

Make the DRBGs to ignore jitterentropy failues if fips_enabled is not set.

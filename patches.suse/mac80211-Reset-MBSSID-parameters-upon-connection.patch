Subject: [PATCH] mac80211: Reset MBSSID parameters upon connection
Git-commit: 86af062f40a73bf63321694e6bf637144f0383fe
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc7
References: git-fixes

Currently MBSSID parameters in struct ieee80211_bss_conf
are not reset upon connection. This could be problematic
with some drivers in a scenario where the device first
connects to a non-transmit BSS and then connects to a
transmit BSS of a Multi BSS AP. The MBSSID parameters
which are set after connecting to a non-transmit BSS will
not be reset and the same parameters will be passed on to
the driver during the subsequent connection to a transmit
BSS of a Multi BSS AP.

For example, firmware running on the ath11k device uses the
Multi BSS data for tracking the beacon of a non-transmit BSS
and reports the driver when there is a beacon miss. If we do
not reset the MBSSID parameters during the subsequent
connection to a transmit BSS, then the driver would have
wrong MBSSID data and FW would be looking for an incorrect
BSSID in the MBSSID beacon of a Multi BSS AP and reports
beacon loss leading to an unstable connection.

Reset the MBSSID parameters upon every connection to solve this
problem.

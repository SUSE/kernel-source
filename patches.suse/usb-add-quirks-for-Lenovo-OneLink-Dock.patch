Subject: [PATCH] usb: add quirks for Lenovo OneLink+ Dock
Git-commit: 3d5f70949f1b1168fbb17d06eb5c57e984c56c58
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc4
References: git-fixes

The Lenovo OneLink+ Dock contains two VL812 USB3.0 controllers:
17ef:1018 upstream
17ef:1019 downstream

Those two controllers both have problems with some USB3.0 devices,
particularly self-powered ones. Typical error messages include:

  Timeout while waiting for setup device command
  device not accepting address X, error -62
  unable to enumerate USB device

By process of elimination the controllers themselves were identified as
the cause of the problem. Through trial and error the issue was solved
by using USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME for both chips.

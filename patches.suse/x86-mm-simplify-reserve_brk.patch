Subject: x86/mm: Simplify RESERVE_BRK()
Git-commit: a1e2c031ec3949b8c039b739c0b5bf9c30007b00
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: bsc#1199657 CVE-2022-29900 CVE-2022-29901

RESERVE_BRK() reserves data in the .brk_reservation section.  The data
is initialized to zero, like BSS, so the macro specifies 'nobits' to
prevent the data from taking up space in the vmlinux binary.  The only
way to get the compiler to do that (without putting the variable in .bss
proper) is to use inline asm.

The macro also has a hack which encloses the inline asm in a discarded
function, which allows the size to be passed (global inline asm doesn't
allow inputs).

Remove the need for the discarded function hack by just stringifying the
size rather than supplying it as an input to the inline asm.

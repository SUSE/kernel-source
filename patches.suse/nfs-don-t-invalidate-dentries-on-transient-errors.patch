Subject: [PATCH] nfs: don't invalidate dentries on transient errors
Git-commit: 0c8c7c559740d2d8b66048162af6c4dba8f0c88c
Patch-mainline: v6.10
References: git-fixes

This is a slight variation on a patch previously proposed by Neil Brown
that never got merged.

Prior to commit 5ceb9d7fdaaf ("NFS: Refactor nfs_lookup_revalidate()"),
any error from nfs_lookup_verify_inode() other than -ESTALE would result
in nfs_lookup_revalidate() returning that error (-ESTALE is mapped to
zero).

Since that commit, all errors result in nfs_lookup_revalidate()
returning zero, resulting in dentries being invalidated where they
previously were not (particularly in the case of -ERESTARTSYS).

Fix it by passing the actual error code to nfs_lookup_revalidate_done(),
and leaving the decision on whether to  map the error code to zero or
one to nfs_lookup_revalidate_done().

A simple reproducer is to run the following python code in a
subdirectory of an NFS mount (not in the root of the NFS mount):

            pool = multiprocessing.Pool(10)
            pool.close()
            pool.terminate()
            count += 1
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed after {count} iterations")
            print(e)
            break

Prior to commit 5ceb9d7fdaaf, the above code would run indefinitely.
After commit 5ceb9d7fdaaf, it fails almost immediately with -ENOENT.

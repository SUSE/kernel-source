Subject: [PATCH] spi: lm70llp: fix links in doc and comments
Git-commit: 7397175cb7b48f7a3fc699083aa46f1234904c7e
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

Update links in the documentation and in-code comments which point to
the datasheet and schematic.

The current links don't work because National Semiconductor (which is
the manufacturer of this board and lm70) has been a part of Texas
Instruments since 2011 and hence http://www.national.com/ doesn't work
anymore.

Fixes: 78961a574037 ("spi_lm70llp parport adapter driver")
Fixes: 2b7300513b98 ("hwmon: (lm70) Code streamlining and cleanup")

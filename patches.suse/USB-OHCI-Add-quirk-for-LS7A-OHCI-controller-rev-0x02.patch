Subject: [PATCH] USB: OHCI: Add quirk for LS7A OHCI controller (rev 0x02)
Git-commit: bcb60d438547355b8f9ad48645909139b64d3482
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc4
References: stable-fixes

The OHCI controller (rev 0x02) under LS7A PCI host has a hardware flaw.
MMIO register with offset 0x60/0x64 is treated as legacy PS2-compatible
keyboard/mouse interface, which confuse the OHCI controller. Since OHCI
only use a 4KB BAR resource indeed, the LS7A OHCI controller's 32KB BAR
is wrapped around (the second 4KB BAR space is the same as the first 4KB
internally). So we can add an 4KB offset (0x1000) to the OHCI registers
(from the PCI BAR resource) as a quirk.

Subject: [PATCH] iavf: fix double unlock of crit_lock
Git-commit: 54ee39439acd9f8b161703c6ad4f4e1835585277
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc5
References: stable-5.14.12

[ Upstream commit 54ee39439acd9f8b161703c6ad4f4e1835585277 ]

The crit_lock mutex could be unlocked twice as reported here
https://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/intel-wired-lan/Week-of-Mon-20210823/025525.html

Remove the superfluous unlock. Technically the problem was already
present before 5ac49f3c2702 as that commit only replaced the locking
primitive, but no functional change.

Fixes: bac8486116b0 ("iavf: Refactor the watchdog state machine")

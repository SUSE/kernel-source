Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/hdmi: fix IRQ lifetime
Git-commit: 152d394842bb564148e68b92486a87db0bf54859
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc3
References: git-fixes

Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.

This is specifically true for the HDMI IRQ, which will otherwise remain
requested so that the next bind attempt fails when requesting the IRQ a
second time.

Fix this by tying the device-managed lifetime of the HDMI IRQ to the DRM
device so that it is released when bind fails.

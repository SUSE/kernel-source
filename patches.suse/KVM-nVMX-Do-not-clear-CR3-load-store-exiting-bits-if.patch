Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Do not clear CR3 load/store exiting bits if L1
 wants 'em

Keep CR3 load/store exiting enable as needed when running L2 in order to
honor L1's desires.  This fixes a largely theoretical bug where L1 could
intercept CR3 but not CR0.PG and end up not getting the desired CR3 exits
when L2 enables paging.  In other words, the existing !is_paging() check
inadvertantly handles the normal case for L2 where vmx_set_cr0() is
called during VM-Enter, which is guaranteed to run with paging enabled,
and thus will never clear the bits.

Removing the !is_paging() check will also allow future consolidation and
cleanup of the related code.  From a performance perspective, this is
all a nop, as the VMCS controls shadow will optimize away the VMWRITE
when the controls are in the desired state.

Add a comment explaining why CR3 is intercepted, with a big disclaimer
about not querying the old CR3.  Because vmx_set_cr0() is used for flows
that are not directly tied to MOV CR3, e.g. vCPU RESET/INIT and nested
VM-Enter, it's possible that is_paging() is not synchronized with CR3
load/store exiting.  This is actually guaranteed in the current code, as
KVM starts with CR3 interception disabled.  Obviously that can be fixed,
but there's no good reason to play whack-a-mole, and it tends to end
poorly, e.g. descriptor table exiting for UMIP emulation attempted to be
precise in the past and ended up botching the interception toggling.

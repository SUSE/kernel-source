Subject: clk: imx93: Move IMX93_CLK_END macro to clk driver
Git-commit: 0af18ba60752e8a4ba34404c1d9a4a799da690f5
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: jsc#PED-12016

IMX93_CLK_END was previously defined in imx93-clock.h to indicate
the number of clocks. However, it is not part of the ABI. For starters
it does no really appear in DTS. But what's more important - new clocks
are described later, which contradicts this define in binding header.
So move this macro to clock driver.

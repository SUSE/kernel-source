Subject: drm/amd/display: Allow building DC with clang on LoongArch
Git-commit: 4217ef9ab763dbf8af2b0ecd3f74c0caa135668c
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

Clang on LoongArch (18+) appears to be unaffected by the bug causing
excessive stack usage in calculate_bandwidth(). But when building DC_FP
support the stack frame size can be as large as 2816 bytes, which causes
the FRAME_WARN build warnings. So on LoongArch we allow building DC with
clang, but disable DC_FP by default.

The help message is also updated.

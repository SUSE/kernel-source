Subject: Documentation/powerpc: update fadump implementation details
Git-commit: 57e6700145c5d1f49c52137e9163f73ec5441256
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9877

The patch titled ("powerpc: make fadump resilient with memory add/remove
events") has made significant changes to the implementation of fadump,
particularly on elfcorehdr creation and fadump crash info header
structure. Therefore, updating the fadump implementation documentation
to reflect those changes.

Following updates are done to firmware assisted dump documentation:

1. The elfcorehdr is no longer stored after fadump HDR in the reserved
   dump area. Instead, the second kernel dynamically allocates memory
   for the elfcorehdr within the address range from 0 to the boot memory
   size. Therefore, update figures 1 and 2 of Memory Reservation during
   the first and second kernels to reflect this change.

2. A version field has been added to the fadump header to manage the
   future changes to fadump crash info header structure without changing
   the fadump header magic number in the future. Therefore, remove the
   corresponding TODO from the document.

  - Need to come up with the better approach to find out more
    accurate boot memory size that is required for a kernel to
    boot successfully when booted with restricted memory.
- - The FADump implementation introduces a FADump crash info structure
-   in the scratch area before the ELF core header. The idea of introducing
-   this structure is to pass some important crash info data to the second
-   kernel which will help second kernel to populate ELF core header with
-   correct data before it gets exported through /proc/vmcore. The current
-   design implementation does not address a possibility of introducing
-   additional fields (in future) to this structure without affecting
-   compatibility. Need to come up with the better approach to address this.
-
-   The possible approaches are:
-
-	1. Introduce version field for version tracking, bump up the version
-	whenever a new field is added to the structure in future. The version
-	field can be used to find out what fields are valid for the current
-	version of the structure.
-	2. Reserve the area of predefined size (say PAGE_SIZE) for this
-	structure and have unused area as reserved (initialized to zero)
-	for future field additions.
-
-   The advantage of approach 1 over 2 is we don't need to reserve extra space.

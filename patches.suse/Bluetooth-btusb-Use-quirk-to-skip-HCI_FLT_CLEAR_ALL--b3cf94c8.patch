Subject: Bluetooth: btusb: Use quirk to skip HCI_FLT_CLEAR_ALL on fake CSR
 controllers

References: jsc#PED-1407

Another subset of the more recent batch of Chinese clones aren't
specs-compliant and seem to lock up whenever they receive a
HCI_OP_SET_EVENT_FLT with flt_type set to zero/HCI_FLT_CLEAR_ALL,
which on Linux (until the recent HCI state-machine refactor) happened
right at BR/EDR setup. As there are other less-straightforward ways
of reaching those operations, this patch is still relevant.

So, while all the previous efforts to wrangle the herd of fake CSRs
seem to be paying off (and these also get detected as such) we
still need to take care of this quirk; testers seem to agree
that these dongles tend to work well enough afterwards.

From some cursory USB packet capture on Windows it seems like
that driver doesn't appear to use this clear-all functionality at all.

This patch was tested on some really popular AliExpress-style
dongles, in my case marked as "V5.0". Chip markings: UG8413,
the backside of the PCB says "USB Dangel" (sic).

Here is the `hciconfig -a` output; for completeness:

Also, changed the benign dmesg print that shows up whenever the
generic force-suspend fails from bt_dev_err to bt_dev_warn;
it's okay and done on a best-effort basis, not a problem
if that does not work.

Also, swapped the HCI subver and LMP subver numbers for the Barrot
in the comment, which I copied wrong the last time around.

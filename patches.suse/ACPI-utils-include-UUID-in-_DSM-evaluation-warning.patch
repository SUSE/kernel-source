Subject: ACPI: utils: include UUID in _DSM evaluation warning
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
Git-commit: 06eb8dc097b3fcb2d02eb553b17af5fcc2952f96
References: jsc#PED-1408

The _DSM evaluation warning in its current form is not very helpful, as
it lacks any specific information:
  ACPI: \: failed to evaluate _DSM (0x1001)

Thus, include the UUID of the missing _DSM:
  ACPI: \: failed to evaluate _DSM bf0212f2-... (0x1001)

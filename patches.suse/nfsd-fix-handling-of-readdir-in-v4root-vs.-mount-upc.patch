Subject: [PATCH] nfsd: fix handling of readdir in v4root vs. mount upcall
 timeout
Git-commit: cad853374d85fe678d721512cecfabd7636e51f3
Patch-mainline: v6.2
References: git-fixes

If v4 READDIR operation hits a mountpoint and gets back an error,
then it will include that entry in the reply and set RDATTR_ERROR for it
to the error.

That's fine for "normal" exported filesystems, but on the v4root, we
need to be more careful to only expose the existence of dentries that
lead to exports.

If the mountd upcall times out while checking to see whether a
mountpoint on the v4root is exported, then we have no recourse other
than to fail the whole operation.

Subject: bpf: Update bpf_override_return() comment
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
Git-commit: c6ca31981b545ad3081007b6aa88b6aab1b0cece
References: jsc#PED-14653

The documentation says CONFIG_FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION is supported only
on x86. This was presumably true at the time of writing, but it's now
supported on many other architectures too. Drop this statement, since
it's not correct anymore and it fits better in other documentation
anyway.

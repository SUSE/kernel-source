Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: stop link training after link training 2 failed
Git-commit: 9051d629dbf7a998a40f7eac65a9512b01bc3bb8
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Each DP link training contains link training 1 followed by link
training 2.  There is maximum of 5 retries of DP link training
before declared link training failed. It is required to stop link
training at end of link training 2 if it is failed so that next
link training 1 can start freshly. This patch fixes link compliance
test  case 4.3.1.13 (Source Device Link Training EQ Fallback Test).

Changes in v10:
--  group into one series

Changes in v11:
-- drop drm/msm/dp: dp_link_parse_sink_count() return immediately if aux read

Fixes: 2e0adc765d88 ("drm/msm/dp: do not end dp link training until video is ready")

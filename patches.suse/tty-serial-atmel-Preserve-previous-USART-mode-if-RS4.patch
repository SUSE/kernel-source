Subject: [PATCH] tty: serial: atmel: Preserve previous USART mode if RS485 disabled

Whenever the atmel_rs485_config() driver method would be called,
the USART mode is reset to normal mode before even checking if
RS485 flag is set, thus resulting in losing the previous USART
mode in the case where the checking fails.

Some tools, such as `linux-serial-test`, lead to the driver calling
this method when doing the setup of the serial port: after setting the
port mode (Hardware Flow Control, Normal Mode, RS485 Mode, etc.),
`linux-serial-test` tries to enable/disable RS485 depending on
the commandline arguments that were passed.

Example of how this issue could reveal itself:
When doing a serial communication with Hardware Flow Control through
`linux-serial-test`, the tool would lead to the driver roughly doing
the following:
- set the corresponding bit to 1 (ATMEL_US_USMODE_HWHS bit in the
ATMEL_US_MR register) through the atmel_set_termios() to enable
Hardware Flow Control
- disable RS485 through the atmel_config_rs485() method
Thus, when the latter is called, the mode will be reset and the
previously set bit is unset, leaving USART in normal mode instead of
the expected Hardware Flow Control mode.

This fix ensures that this reset is only done if the checking for
RS485 succeeds and that the previous mode is preserved otherwise.

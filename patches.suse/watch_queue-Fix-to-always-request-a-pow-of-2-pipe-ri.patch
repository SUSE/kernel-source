Subject: [PATCH] watch_queue: Fix to always request a pow-of-2 pipe ring size
Git-commit: 96a4d8912b28451cd62825fd7caa0e66e091d938
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc8
References: CVE-2022-0995 bsc#1197246

The pipe ring size must always be a power of 2 as the head and tail
pointers are masked off by AND'ing with the size of the ring - 1.
watch_queue_set_size(), however, lets you specify any number of notes
between 1 and 511.  This number is passed through to pipe_resize_ring()
without checking/forcing its alignment.

Fix this by rounding the number of slots required up to the nearest
power of two.  The request is meant to guarantee that at least that many
notifications can be generated before the queue is full, so rounding
down isn't an option, but, alternatively, it may be better to give an
error if we aren't allowed to allocate that much ring space.

Subject: x86/entry: Don't call error_entry() for XENPV
Git-commit: 64cbd0acb58203fb769ed2f4eab526d43e243847
Patch-mainline: 5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

XENPV guests enter already on the task stack and they can't fault for
native_iret() nor native_load_gs_index() since they use their own pvop
for IRET and load_gs_index(). A CR3 switch is not needed either.

So there is no reason to call error_entry() in XENPV.

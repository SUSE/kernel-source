Subject: iommu/virtio: Fix interaction with VFIO
Git-commit: 91c98fe7941499e4127cdc359c30841b873dd43a
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc5
References: bsc#1205701

Commit e8ae0e140c05 ("vfio: Require that devices support DMA cache
coherence") requires IOMMU drivers to advertise
IOMMU_CAP_CACHE_COHERENCY, in order to be used by VFIO. Since VFIO does
not provide to userspace the ability to maintain coherency through cache
invalidations, it requires hardware coherency. Advertise the capability
in order to restore VFIO support.

The meaning of IOMMU_CAP_CACHE_COHERENCY also changed from "IOMMU can
enforce cache coherent DMA transactions" to "IOMMU_CACHE is supported".
While virtio-iommu cannot enforce coherency (of PCIe no-snoop
transactions), it does support IOMMU_CACHE.

We can distinguish different cases of non-coherent DMA:

(1) When accesses from a hardware endpoint are not coherent. The host
    would describe such a device using firmware methods ('dma-coherent'
    in device-tree, '_CCA' in ACPI), since they are also needed without
    a vIOMMU. In this case mappings are created without IOMMU_CACHE.
    virtio-iommu doesn't need any additional support. It sends the same
    requests as for coherent devices.

(2) When the physical IOMMU supports non-cacheable mappings. Supporting
    those would require a new feature in virtio-iommu, new PROBE request
    property and MAP flags. Device drivers would use a new API to
    discover this since it depends on the architecture and the physical
    IOMMU.

(3) When the hardware supports PCIe no-snoop. It is possible for
    assigned PCIe devices to issue no-snoop transactions, and the
    virtio-iommu specification is lacking any mention of this.

    Arm platforms don't necessarily support no-snoop, and those that do
    cannot enforce coherency of no-snoop transactions. Device drivers
    must be careful about assuming that no-snoop transactions won't end
    up cached; see commit e02f5c1bb228 ("drm: disable uncached DMA
    optimization for ARM and arm64"). On x86 platforms, the host may or
    may not enforce coherency of no-snoop transactions with the physical
    IOMMU. But according to the above commit, on x86 a driver which
    assumes that no-snoop DMA is compatible with uncached CPU mappings
    will also work if the host enforces coherency.

    Although these issues are not specific to virtio-iommu, it could be
    used to facilitate discovery and configuration of no-snoop. This
    would require a new feature bit, PROBE property and ATTACH/MAP
    flags.

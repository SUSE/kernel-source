Subject: [PATCH] xfs: separate out log shutdown callback processing
Git-commit: aad7272a920869b950d937b87562e494af72523c
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1211811

The iclog callback processing done during a forced log shutdown has
different logic to normal runtime IO completion callback processing.
Separate out the shutdown callbacks into their own function and call
that from the shutdown code instead.

We don't need this shutdown specific logic in the normal runtime
completion code - we'll always run the shutdown version on shutdown,
and it will do what shutdown needs regardless of whether there are
racing IO completion callbacks scheduled or in progress. Hence we
can also simplify the normal IO completion callpath and only abort
if shutdown occurred while we actively were processing callbacks.

Further, separating out the IO completion logic from the shutdown
logic avoids callback race conditions from being triggered by log IO
completion after a shutdown. IO completion will now only run
callbacks on iclogs that are in the correct state for a callback to
be run, avoiding the possibility of running callbacks on a
referenced iclog that hasn't yet been submitted for IO.

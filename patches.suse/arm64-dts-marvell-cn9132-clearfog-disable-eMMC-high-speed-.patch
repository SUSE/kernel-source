Subject: arm64: dts: marvell: cn9132-clearfog: disable eMMC high-speed modes
Git-commit: 48b51799a5461707705454568453618cdd7307f4
Patch-mainline: v6.17
References: git-fixes

Similar to MacchiatoBIN the high-speed modes are unstable on the CN9132
CEX-7 module, leading to failed transactions under normal use.

Disable all high-speed modes including UHS.

Additionally add no-sdio and non-removable properties as appropriate for
eMMC.

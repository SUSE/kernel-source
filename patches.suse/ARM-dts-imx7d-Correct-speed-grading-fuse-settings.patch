Subject: ARM: dts: imx7d: Correct speed grading fuse settings
Git-commit: f7429d5c27b665de83bd555d6e6e102a51fdc7a5
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

The 800MHz opp speed grading fuse mask should be 0xd instead
of 0xf according to fuse map definition:

SPEED_GRADING[1:0]	MHz
	00		800
	01		500
	10		1000
	11		1200

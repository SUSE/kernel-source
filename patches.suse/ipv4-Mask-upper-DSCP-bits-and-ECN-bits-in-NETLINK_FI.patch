Subject: ipv4: Mask upper DSCP bits and ECN bits in NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP family
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
Git-commit: 8fed54758cd248cd311a2b5c1e180abef1866237
References: git-fixes

The NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP netlink family can be used to perform a FIB
lookup according to user provided parameters and communicate the result
back to user space.

However, unlike other users of the FIB lookup API, the upper DSCP bits
and the ECN bits of the DS field are not masked, which can result in the
wrong result being returned.

Solve this by masking the upper DSCP bits and the ECN bits using
IPTOS_RT_MASK.

The structure that communicates the request and the response is not
exported to user space, so it is unlikely that this netlink family is
actually in use [1].

Subject: ice: enable parsing IPSEC SPI headers for RSS
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc5
Git-commit: 86006f996346e8a5a1ea80637ec949ceeea4ecbc
References: git-fixes

The COMMS package can enable the hardware parser to recognize IPSEC
frames with ESP header and SPI identifier.  If this package is available
and configured for loading in /lib/firmware, then the driver will
succeed in enabling this protocol type for RSS.

This in turn allows the hardware to hash over the SPI and use it to pick
a consistent receive queue for the same secure flow. Without this all
traffic is steered to the same queue for multiple traffic threads from
the same IP address. For that reason this is marked as a fix, as the
driver supports the model, but it wasn't enabled.

If the package is not available, adding this type will fail, but the
failure is ignored on purpose as it has no negative affect.

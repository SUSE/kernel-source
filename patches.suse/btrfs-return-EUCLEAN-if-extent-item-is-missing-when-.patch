Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: return -EUCLEAN if extent item is missing when
 searching inline backref

At lookup_inline_extent_backref() when trying to insert an inline backref,
if we don't find the extent item we log an error and then return -EIO.
This error code is confusing because there was actually no IO error, and
this means we have some corruption, either caused by a bug or something
like a memory bitflip for example. So change the error code from -EIO to
-EUCLEAN.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix silent output on Gigabyte X570S Aorus Master (newer chipset)
Git-commit: 41a8601302ecbe704ac970552c33dc942300fc37
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc3
References: git-fixes

Newer versions of the X570 Master come with a newer revision of the
mainboard chipset - the X570S. These boards have the same ALC1220 codec
but seem to initialize the codec with a different parameter in Coef 0x7
which causes the output audio to be very low. We therefore write a
known-good value to Coef 0x7 to fix that. As the value is the exact same
as on the other X570(non-S) boards the same quirk-function can be shared
between both generations.

This commit adds the Gigabyte X570S Aorus Master to the list of boards
using the ALC1220_FIXUP_GB_X570 quirk. This fixes both, the silent output
and the no-audio after reboot from windows problems.

This work has been tested by the folks over at the level1techs forum here:

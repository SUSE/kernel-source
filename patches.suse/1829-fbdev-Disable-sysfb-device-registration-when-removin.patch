Subject: fbdev: Disable sysfb device registration when removing conflicting
 FBs
Git-commit: ee7a69aa38d87a3bbced7b8245c732c05ed0c6ec
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc5
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

The platform devices registered by sysfb match with firmware-based DRM or
fbdev drivers, that are used to have early graphics using a framebuffer
provided by the system firmware.

DRM or fbdev drivers later are probed and remove conflicting framebuffers,
leading to these platform devices for generic drivers to be unregistered.

But the current solution has a race, since the sysfb_init() function could
be called after a DRM or fbdev driver is probed and request to unregister
the devices for drivers with conflicting framebuffes.

To prevent this, disable any future sysfb platform device registration by
calling sysfb_disable(), if a driver requests to remove the conflicting
framebuffers.

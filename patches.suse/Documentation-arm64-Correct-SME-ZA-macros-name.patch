Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: arm64: Correct SME ZA macros name
Git-commit: c3651feff2969b13c45f87444befcb96a0137b8d
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1

It should be ZA_PT_ZA*. ZA_PT_ZA_OFFSET is one example.

It is not ZA_PT_ZA_* because there is one macro ZA_PT_ZAV_OFFSET
that doesn't fit that pattern.

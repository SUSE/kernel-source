Commit 226fae124b2d ("vc_screen: move load of struct vc_data pointer in
vcs_read() to avoid UAF") moved the call to vcs_vc() into the loop.

While doing this it also moved the unconditional assignment of

	ret = -ENXIO;

This unconditional assignment was valid outside the loop but within it
it clobbers the actual value of ret.

To avoid this only assign "ret = -ENXIO" when actually needed.

[ Also, the 'goto unlock_out" needs to be just a "break", so that it
  does the right thing when it exits on later iterations when partial
  success has happened - Linus ]

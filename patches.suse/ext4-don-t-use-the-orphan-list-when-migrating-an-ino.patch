Subject: [PATCH] ext4: don't use the orphan list when migrating an inode
Git-commit: 6eeaf88fd586f05aaf1d48cb3a139d2a5c6eb055
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsc#1197756

We probably want to remove the indirect block to extents migration
feature after a deprecation window, but until then, let's fix a
potential data loss problem caused by the fact that we put the
tmp_inode on the orphan list.  In the unlikely case where we crash and
do a journal recovery, the data blocks belonging to the inode being
migrated are also represented in the tmp_inode on the orphan list ---
and so its data blocks will get marked unallocated, and available for
reuse.

Instead, stop putting the tmp_inode on the oprhan list.  So in the
case where we crash while migrating the inode, we'll leak an inode,
which is not a disaster.  It will be easily fixed the next time we run
fsck, and it's better than potentially having blocks getting claimed
by two different files, and losing data as a result.

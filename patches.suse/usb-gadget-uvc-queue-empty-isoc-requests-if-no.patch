Subject: [PATCH] usb: gadget: uvc: queue empty isoc requests if no video
 buffer is available
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.12
Git-commit: c3ff12a92bd7072170978b8b41c2fa41b038139a

[ Upstream commit c3ff12a92bd7072170978b8b41c2fa41b038139a ]

ISOC transfers expect a certain cadence of requests being queued. Not
keeping up with the expected rate of requests results in missed ISOC
transfers (EXDEV). The application layer may or may not produce video
frames to match this expectation, so uvc gadget driver must handle cases
where the application is not queuing up buffers fast enough to fulfill
ISOC requirements.

Currently, uvc gadget driver waits for new video buffer to become available
before queuing up usb requests. With this patch the gadget driver queues up
0 length usb requests whenever there are no video buffers available. The
USB controller's complete callback is used as the limiter for how quickly
the 0 length packets will be queued. Video buffers are still queued as
soon as they become available.

Subject: [PATCH] usb-storage: Add quirk for incorrect WP on Kingston DT Ultimate 3.0 G3
Git-commit: 772685c14743ad565bb271041ad3c262298cd6fc
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc7
References: git-fixes

This flash drive reports write protect during the first mode sense.

In the past this was not an issue as the kernel called revalidate twice,
thus asking the device for its write protect status twice, with write
protect being disabled in the second mode sense.

However, since commit 1e029397d12f ("scsi: sd: Reorganize DIF/DIX code to
avoid calling revalidate twice") that is no longer the case, thus the
device shows up read only.

[490891.289495] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdl] Write Protect is on
[490891.289497] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdl] Mode Sense: 2b 00 80 08

This does not appear to be a timing issue, as enabling the usbcore quirk
USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT has no effect on write protect.

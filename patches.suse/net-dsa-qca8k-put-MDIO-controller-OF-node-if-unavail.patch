Subject: net: dsa: qca8k: put MDIO controller OF node if unavailable
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
Git-commit: 08932323ccf7f8c4c85db9cb12a791ed81264f66
References: bsc#1232178

It was pointed out during the review [1] of commit e66bf63a7f67 ("net:
dsa: qca8k: skip MDIO bus creation if its OF node has status =
"disabled"") that we now leak a reference to the "mdio" OF node if it is
disabled.

This is only a concern when using dynamic OF as far as I can tell (like
probing on an overlay), since OF nodes are never freed in the regular
case. Additionally, I'm unaware of any actual device trees (in
production or elsewhere) which have status = "disabled" for the MDIO OF
node. So handling this as a simple enhancement.

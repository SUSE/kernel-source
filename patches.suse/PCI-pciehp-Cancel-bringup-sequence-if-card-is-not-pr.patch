Subject: [PATCH] PCI: pciehp: Cancel bringup sequence if card is not present
Git-commit: e8afd0d9fccc27c8ad263db5cf5952cfcf72d6fe
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

If a PCIe hotplug slot has an Attention Button, the normal hot-add flow is:

  - Slot is empty and slot power is off
  - User inserts card in slot and presses Attention Button
  - OS blinks Power Indicator for 5 seconds
  - After 5 seconds, OS turns on Power Indicator, turns on slot power, and
    enumerates the device

Previously, if a user pressed the Attention Button on an *empty* slot,
pciehp logged the following messages and blinked the Power Indicator
until a second button press:

  [0.000] pciehp: Button press: will power on in 5 sec
  [0.001] # Power Indicator starts blinking
  [5.001] # 5 second timeout; slot is empty, so we should cancel the
            request to power on and turn off Power Indicator

  [7.000] # Power Indicator still blinking
  [8.000] # possible card insertion
  [9.000] pciehp: Button press: canceling request to power on

The first button press incorrectly left the slot in BLINKINGON_STATE, so
the second was interpreted as a "cancel power on" event regardless of
whether a card was present.

If the slot is empty, turn off the Power Indicator and return from
BLINKINGON_STATE to OFF_STATE after 5 seconds, effectively canceling the
request to power on.  Putting the slot in OFF_STATE also means the second
button press will correctly request a slot power on if the slot is
occupied.

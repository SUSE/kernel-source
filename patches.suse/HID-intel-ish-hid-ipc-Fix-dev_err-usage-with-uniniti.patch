Subject: [PATCH] HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Fix dev_err usage with uninitialized
 dev->devc
Git-commit: 92826905ae340b7f2b25759a06c8c60bfc476b9f
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc6
References: bsc#1242745

The variable dev->devc in ish_dev_init was utilized by dev_err before it
was properly assigned. To rectify this, the assignment of dev->devc has
been moved to immediately follow memory allocation.

Without this change "(NULL device *)" is printed for device information.

Fixes: 8ae2f2b0a284 ("HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Fix potential use-after-free in work function")
Fixes: ae02e5d40d5f ("HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc layer")

Subject: drm/sched: Clarify docu concerning drm_sched_job_arm()

The documentation for drm_sched_job_arm() and especially
drm_sched_job_cleanup() does not make it very clear why
drm_sched_job_arm() is a point of no return, which it indeed is.

Make the nature of drm_sched_job_arm() in the docu as clear as possible.

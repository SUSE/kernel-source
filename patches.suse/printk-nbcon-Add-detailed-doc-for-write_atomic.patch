Subject: [PATCH] printk: nbcon: Add detailed doc for write_atomic()

References: bsc#1214683 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Git-commit: 7d56936c1e5208b5eeea2a9a2f70e85248f6da49
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1

The write_atomic() callback has special requirements and is
allowed to use special helper functions. Provide detailed
documentation of the callback so that a developer has a
chance of implementing it correctly.

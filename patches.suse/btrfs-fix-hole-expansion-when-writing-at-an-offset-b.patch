Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix hole expansion when writing at an offset beyond
 EOF
Git-commit: da2dccd7451de62b175fb8f0808d644959e964c7
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc3
References: bsc#1241151

At btrfs_write_check() if our file's i_size is not sector size aligned and
we have a write that starts at an offset larger than the i_size that falls
within the same page of the i_size, then we end up not zeroing the file
range [i_size, write_offset).

The code is this:

    start_pos = round_down(pos, fs_info->sectorsize);
    oldsize = i_size_read(inode);
    if (start_pos > oldsize) {
        /* Expand hole size to cover write data, preventing empty gap */
        loff_t end_pos = round_up(pos + count, fs_info->sectorsize);

        ret = btrfs_cont_expand(BTRFS_I(inode), oldsize, end_pos);
        if (ret)
            return ret;
    }

So if our file's i_size is 90269 bytes and a write at offset 90365 bytes
comes in, we get 'start_pos' set to 90112 bytes, which is less than the
i_size and therefore we don't zero out the range [90269, 90365) by
calling btrfs_cont_expand().

This is an old bug introduced in commit 9036c10208e1 ("Btrfs: update hole
handling v2"), from 2008, and the buggy code got moved around over the
years.

Fix this by discarding 'start_pos' and comparing against the write offset
('pos') without any alignment.

This bug was recently exposed by test case generic/363 which tests this
scenario by polluting ranges beyond EOF with an mmap write and than verify
that after a file increases we get zeroes for the range which is supposed
to be a hole and not what we wrote with the previous mmaped write.

We're only seeing this exposed now because generic/363 used to run only
on xfs until last Sunday's fstests update.

The test was failing like this:

Subject: [PATCH] tpm: use try_get_ops() in tpm-space.c
Git-commit: fb5abce6b2bb5cb3d628aaa63fa821da8c4600f9
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

As part of the series conversion to remove nested TPM operations:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190205224723.19671-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/

exposure of the chip->tpm_mutex was removed from much of the upper
level code.  In this conversion, tpm2_del_space() was missed.  This
didn't matter much because it's usually called closely after a
converted operation, so there's only a very tiny race window where the
chip can be removed before the space flushing is done which causes a
NULL deref on the mutex.  However, there are reports of this window
being hit in practice, so fix this by converting tpm2_del_space() to
use tpm_try_get_ops(), which performs all the teardown checks before
acquring the mutex.

Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: mvm: don't change band on bound PHY contexts
Git-commit: 8835a64f74c46baebfc946cd5a2c861b866ebcee
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

When we have a P2P Device active, we attempt to only change the
PHY context it uses when we get a new remain-on-channel, if the
P2P Device is the only user of the PHY context.

This is fine if we're switching within a band, but if we're
switching bands then the switch implies a removal and re-add
of the PHY context, which isn't permitted by the firmware while
it's bound to an interface.

Fix the code to skip the unbind/release/... cycle only if the
band doesn't change (or we have old devices that can switch the
band on the fly as well.)

Subject: [PATCH] mtd: nand: raw: atmel: Fix comment in timings preparation
Git-commit: 1c60e027ffdebd36f4da766d9c9abbd1ea4dd8f9
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: stable-fixes

Looks like a copy'n'paste mistake introduced when initially adding the
dynamic timings feature with commit f9ce2eddf176 ("mtd: nand: atmel: Add
->setup_data_interface() hooks").  The context around this and
especially the code itself suggests 'read' is meant instead of write.

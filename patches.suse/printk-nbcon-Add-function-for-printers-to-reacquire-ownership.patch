Subject: [PATCH] printk: nbcon: Add function for printers to reacquire
 ownership

References: bsc#1232534 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
Git-commit: bd07d864522e7c3e4ee364e91aee8754992f5855

Since ownership can be lost at any time due to handover or
takeover, a printing context _must_ be prepared to back out
immediately and carefully. However, there are scenarios where
the printing context must reacquire ownership in order to
finalize or revert hardware changes.

One such example is when interrupts are disabled during
printing. No other context will automagically re-enable the
interrupts. For this case, the disabling context _must_
reacquire nbcon ownership so that it can re-enable the
interrupts.

Provide nbcon_reacquire_nobuf() for exactly this purpose. It
allows a printing context to reacquire ownership using the same
priority as its previous ownership.

Note that after a successful reacquire the printing context
will have no output buffer because that has been lost. This
function cannot be used to resume printing.

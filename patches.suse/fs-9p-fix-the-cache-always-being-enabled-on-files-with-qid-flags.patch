Subject: [PATCH] fs/9p: fix the cache always being enabled on files with qid
 flags
Git-commit: 4e5d208cc9bd5fbc95d536fa223b4b14c37b8ca8
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc5
References: git-fixes

I'm not sure why this check was ever here. After updating to 6.6 I
suddenly found caching had been turned on by default and neither
cache=none nor the new directio would turn it off. After walking through
the new code very manually I realized that it's because the caching has
to be, in effect, turned off explicitly by setting P9L_DIRECT and
whenever a file has a flag, in my case QTAPPEND, it doesn't get set.

Setting aside QTDIR which seems to ignore the new fid->mode entirely,
the rest of these either should be subject to the same cache rules as
every other QTFILE or perhaps very explicitly not cached in the case of
QTAUTH.

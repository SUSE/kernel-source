Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: dp83867: retrigger SGMII AN when link change
Git-commit: c76acfb7e19dcc3a0964e0563770b1d11b8d4540
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc2
References: git-fixes

There is a limitation in TI DP83867 PHY device where SGMII AN is only
triggered once after the device is booted up. Even after the PHY TPI is
down and up again, SGMII AN is not triggered and hence no new in-band
message from PHY to MAC side SGMII.

This could cause an issue during power up, when PHY is up prior to MAC.
At this condition, once MAC side SGMII is up, MAC side SGMII wouldn`t
receive new in-band message from TI PHY with correct link status, speed
and duplex info.

As suggested by TI, implemented a SW solution here to retrigger SGMII
Auto-Neg whenever there is a link change.

V2: Add Fixes tag in commit message.

Subject: net: stmmac: rename stmmac_init_ptp()
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
Git-commit: b09f58ddc6ca8ae09e3df9ca485d92cc504b238f
References: jsc#PED-14197 jsc#PED-14199 jsc#PED-15315

Changes to the stmmac driver to fix various issues with PTP have made
stmmac_init_ptp() less about initialising the entire PTP block, and
now primarily deals with the packet timestamping support. The exception
to this is ptp_clk_freq_config(), which is an odditiy. It remains
as stmmac_init_ptp() is used both at .ndo_open() time and in the
resume paths.

However, restructuring this code to make it more easily readable makes
the continued use of "init_ptp" confusing.

In preparation to cleaning up the (re-)initialisation of timestamping,
rename the existing stmmac_init_ptp() to stmmac_init_timestamping()
which better reflects its functionality.

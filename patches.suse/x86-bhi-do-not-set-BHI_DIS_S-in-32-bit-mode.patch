Subject: x86/bhi: Do not set BHI_DIS_S in 32-bit mode
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc7
Git-commit: 073fdbe02c69c43fb7c0d547ec265c7747d4a646
References: bsc#1242778

With the possibility of intra-mode BHI via cBPF, complete mitigation for
BHI is to use IBHF (history fence) instruction with BHI_DIS_S set. Since
this new instruction is only available in 64-bit mode, setting BHI_DIS_S in
32-bit mode is only a partial mitigation.

Do not set BHI_DIS_S in 32-bit mode so as to avoid reporting misleading
mitigated status. With this change IBHF won't be used in 32-bit mode, also
remove the CONFIG_X86_64 check from emit_spectre_bhb_barrier().

Subject: [PATCH] smb: client: fix dfs link mount against w2k8
Git-commit: 11260c3d608b59231f4c228147a795ab21a10b33
References: bsc#1212142
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc5

Customer reported that they couldn't mount their DFS link that was
seen by the client as a DFS interlink -- special form of DFS link
where its single target may point to a different DFS namespace -- and
it turned out that it was just a regular DFS link where its referral
header flags missed the StorageServers bit thus making the client
think it couldn't tree connect to target directly without requiring
further referrals.

When the DFS link referral header flags misses the StoraServers bit
and its target doesn't respond to any referrals, then tree connect to
it.

Fixes: a1c0d00572fc ("cifs: share dfs connections and supers")

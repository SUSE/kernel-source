Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: btusb: Make the CSR clone chip force-suspend workaround more generic
Git-commit: f4292e2faf522f899b642d2040a2edbcbd455b9f
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

Turns out Hans de Goede completed the work I started last year trying to
improve Chinese-clone detection of CSR controller chips. Quirk after quirk
these Bluetooth dongles are more usable now.

Even after a few BlueZ regressions; these clones are so fickle that some
days they stop working altogether. Except on Windows, they work fine.

But this force-suspend initialization quirk seems to mostly do the trick,
after a lot of testing Bluetooth now seems to work *all* the time.

The only problem is that the solution ended up being masked under a very
stringent check; when there are probably hundreds of fake dongle
models out there that benefit from a good reset. Make it so.

Fixes: 81cac64ba258a ("Bluetooth: Deal with USB devices that are faking CSR vendor")
Fixes: cde1a8a992875 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Fix and detect most of the Chinese Bluetooth controllers")
Fixes: d74e0ae7e0303 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Fix detection of some fake CSR controllers with a bcdDevice val of 0x0134")
Fixes: 0671c0662383e ("Bluetooth: btusb: Add workaround for remote-wakeup issues with Barrot 8041a02 fake CSR controllers")

Subject: Revert "scsi: ufs: fix a missing check of devm_reset_control_get"
Git-commit: 4d427b408c4c2ff1676966c72119a3a559f8e39b
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit 63a06181d7ce169d09843645c50fea1901bc9f0a.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original commit is incorrect, it does not properly clean up on the
error path, so I'll keep the revert and fix it up properly with a
follow-on patch.

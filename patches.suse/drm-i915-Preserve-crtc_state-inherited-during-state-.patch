Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Preserve crtc_state->inherited during state clearing
Mime-version: 1.0

References: git-fixes

intel_crtc_prepare_cleared_state() is unintentionally losing
the "inherited" flag. This will happen if intel_initial_commit()
is forced to go through the full modeset calculations for
whatever reason.

Afterwards the first real commit from userspace will not get
forced to the full modeset path, and thus eg. audio state may
not get recomputed properly. So if the monitor was already
enabled during boot audio will not work until userspace itself
does an explicit full modeset.

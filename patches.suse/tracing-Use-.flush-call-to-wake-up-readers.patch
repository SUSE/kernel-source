Subject: tracing: Use .flush() call to wake up readers
Git-commit: e5d7c1916562f0e856eb3d6f569629fcd535fed2
Patch-mainline: v6.8
References: git-fixes

The .release() function does not get called until all readers of a file
descriptor are finished.

If a thread is blocked on reading a file descriptor in ring_buffer_wait(),
and another thread closes the file descriptor, it will not wake up the
other thread as ring_buffer_wake_waiters() is called by .release(), and
that will not get called until the .read() is finished.

The issue originally showed up in trace-cmd, but the readers are actually
other processes with their own file descriptors. So calling close() would wake
up the other tasks because they are blocked on another descriptor then the
one that was closed(). But there's other wake ups that solve that issue.

When a thread is blocked on a read, it can still hang even when another
thread closed its descriptor.

This is what the .flush() callback is for. Have the .flush() wake up the
readers.

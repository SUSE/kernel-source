Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx7: Move hsic_phy power domain to HSIC PHY node
Git-commit: 552ca27929ab28b341ae9b2629f0de3a84c98ee8
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc4
References: git-fixes

Move the power domain to its actual user. This keeps the power domain
enabled even when the USB host is runtime suspended. This is necessary
to detect any downstream events, like device attach.

Fixes: 02f8eb40ef7b ("ARM: dts: imx7s: Add power domain for imx7d HSIC")

Subject: [PATCH] scripts/kernel-doc: restore warning for Excess struct/union
Git-commit: b77fdd6a48e60a0ed1865edbe6d9bf0538551f85
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

The warning for Excess struct or union member description was
removed when the $nested parameter of check_sections() was removed.
This causes some kernel-doc notation warnings to be missed.

Recently the kernel test robot somehow reported an Excess member. The
code in kernel-doc has not issued that warning since kernel v4.16, so I
don't know how the robot did it. (See the Link for the report.)

  drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/fw/dbg.c:86: warning: Excess struct/union/enum/typedef member 'trans_len' description in 'iwl_fw_dump_ptrs'

I patched that warning away even though I could not reproduce the
warning from kernel-doc. The warning should be issued for extraneous
struct member or union member description, so restore it.

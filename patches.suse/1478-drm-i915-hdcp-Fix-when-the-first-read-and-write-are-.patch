Subject: drm/i915/hdcp: Fix when the first read and write are retried
Git-commit: 376a33c4a0d8344bb575e1a6eeb748ee4d4675d3
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

Make sure that the first read/write in hdcp2_authentication_key_exchange
are only retried when we have either DP/DPMST encoder connected,
since we do this to give docks and dp encoders some extra time to
get their HDCP DPCD registers ready only for DP/DPMST encoders as
this issue is only observed here no need to burden other encoders
with extra retries as this causes the HDMI connector to have some
other timing issue and fails HDCP authentication.

--v2
-Add intent of patch [Chaitanya]
-Add reasoning for loop [Jani]
-Make sure we forfiet the 50ms wait for non DP/DPMST encoders.

--v3
-Remove the is_dp_encoder check [Jani/Chaitanya]
-Make the commit message more clearer [Jani]

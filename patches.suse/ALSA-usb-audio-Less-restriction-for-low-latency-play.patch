Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Less restriction for low-latency playback mode
Git-commit: 53451b6da8271905941eb1eb369db152c4bd92f2
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsc#1192354

The recent support for the improved low-latency playback mode applied
the SNDRV_PCM_INFO_EXPLICIT_SYNC flag for the target streams, but this
was a slight overkill.  The use of the flag above disables effectively
both PCM status and control mmaps, while basically what we want to
track is only about the appl_ptr update.

For less restriction, use a more proper flag,
SNDRV_PCM_INFO_SYNC_APPLPTR instead, which disables only the control
mmap.

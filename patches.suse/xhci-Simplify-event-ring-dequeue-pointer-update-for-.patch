Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Simplify event ring dequeue pointer update for port
 change events
Git-commit: d1830364e9633573947185343d28aa1224356743
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1

Increase the event ring dequeue pointer for port change events in the
same way as other event types. No need to handle it separately.

This only touches the driver side tracking of event ring dequeue.

Note: this does move forward the event ring dequeue increase for port
change events a bit.
Previously the dequeue was increased before temporarily dropping
the xhci lock while kicking roothub polling.
Now dequeue is increased after re-aquiring the lock.

This should not matter as event ring dequeue is not touched at all by
hub thread. It's only touched in xhci interrupt handler.

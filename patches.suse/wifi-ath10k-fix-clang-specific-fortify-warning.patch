Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath10k: fix clang-specific fortify warning
Git-commit: cb4c132ebfeac5962f7258ffc831caa0c4dada1a
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

When compiling with clang 16.0.6 and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y, I've
noticed the following (somewhat confusing due to absence of an actual
source code location):

./include/linux/fortify-string.h:592:4: warning: call to '__read_overflow2_field'
declared with 'warning' attribute: detected read beyond size of field (2nd
parameter); maybe use struct_group()? [-Wattribute-warning]
                        __read_overflow2_field(q_size_field, size);

The compiler actually complains on 'ath10k_debug_get_et_strings()' where
fortification logic inteprets call to 'memcpy()' as an attempt to copy
the whole 'ath10k_gstrings_stats' array from it's first member and so
issues an overread warning. This warning may be silenced by passing
an address of the whole array and not the first member to 'memcpy()'.

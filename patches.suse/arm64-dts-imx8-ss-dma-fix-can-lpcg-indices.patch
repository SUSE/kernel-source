Subject: arm64: dts: imx8-ss-dma: fix can lpcg indices
Git-commit: 0893392334b5dffdf616a53679c6a2942c46391b
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc4
References: git-fixes

can0_lpcg: clock-controller@5acd0000 {
	...						   Col1  Col2
	clocks = <&clk IMX_SC_R_CAN_0 IMX_SC_PM_CLK_PER>, // 0    0
		 <&dma_ipg_clk>,			  // 1    4
		 <&dma_ipg_clk>;			  // 2    5
        clock-indices = <IMX_LPCG_CLK_0>,
			<IMX_LPCG_CLK_4>,
			<IMX_LPCG_CLK_5>;
}

Col1: index, which existing dts try to get.
Col2: actual index in lpcg driver.

flexcan1: can@5a8d0000 {
	clocks = <&can0_lpcg 1>, <&can0_lpcg 0>;
			     ^^		     ^^
Should be:
	clocks = <&can0_lpcg IMX_LPCG_CLK_4>, <&can0_lpcg IMX_LPCG_CLK_0>;
};

Arg0 is divided by 4 in lpcg driver. flexcan driver get IMX_SC_PM_CLK_PER
by <&can0_lpcg 1> and <&can0_lpcg 0>. Although function can work, code
logic is wrong. Fix it by using correct clock indices.

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: terminate perag iteration reliably on agcount
Git-commit: 8ed004eb9d07a5d6114db3e97a166707c186262d
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

The for_each_perag_from() iteration macro relies on sb_agcount to
process every perag currently within EOFS from a given starting
point. It's perfectly valid to have perag structures beyond
sb_agcount, however, such as if a growfs is in progress. If a perag
loop happens to race with growfs in this manner, it will actually
attempt to process the post-EOFS perag where ->pag_agno ==
sb_agcount. This is reproduced by xfs/104 and manifests as the
following assert failure in superblock write verifier context:

 XFS: Assertion failed: agno < mp->m_sb.sb_agcount, file: fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_types.c, line: 22

Update the corresponding macro to only process perags that are
within the current sb_agcount.

Fixes: 58d43a7e3263 ("xfs: pass perags around in fsmap data dev functions")

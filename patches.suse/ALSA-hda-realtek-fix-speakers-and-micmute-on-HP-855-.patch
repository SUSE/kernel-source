Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: fix speakers and micmute on HP 855 G8
Git-commit: 91502a9a0b0d5252cf3f32ebd898823c2f5aadab
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

There are several PCI ids associated with HP EliteBook 855 G8 Notebook
PC. Commit 0e68c4b11f1e6 ("ALSA: hda/realtek: fix mute/micmute LEDs for
HP 855 G8") covers 0x103c:0x8896, while this commit covers 0x103c:0x8895
which needs some additional work on top of the quirk from 0e68c4b11f1e6.

Note that the device can boot up with working speakers and micmute LED
without this patch, but the success rate would be quite low (order of
16 working boots across 709 boots) at least for the built-in drivers
scenario. This also means that there are some timing issues during early
boot and this patch is a workaround.

With this patch applied speakers and headphones are consistenly working,
as well as mute/micmute LEDs and the internal microphone.

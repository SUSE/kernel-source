Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: fix fw/img.c license statement
Git-commit: 98c8bd77e62437499b6e421e4dce2d03c65ceed0
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsc#1202131

We still had the entire license statement here, but with BSD,
so the SPDX tag was not matching the actual text. Fix that
and remove all the texts since they're no longer needed.

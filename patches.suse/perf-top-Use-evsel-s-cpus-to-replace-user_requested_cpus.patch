Subject: perf top: Use evsel's cpus to replace user_requested_cpus
Git-commit: 5fa695e7da4975e8d21ce49f3718d6cf00ecb75e
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes, perf-sp7-v6.11-userspace-update

perf top errors out on a hybrid machine
 $perf top

 Error:
 The cycles:P event is not supported.

The perf top expects that the "cycles" is collected on all CPUs in the
system. But for hybrid there is no single "cycles" event which can cover
all CPUs. Perf has to split it into two cycles events, e.g.,
cpu_core/cycles/ and cpu_atom/cycles/. Each event has its own CPU mask.
If a event is opened on the unsupported CPU. The open fails. That's the
reason of the above error out.

Perf should only open the cycles event on the corresponding CPU. The
commit ef91871c960e ("perf evlist: Propagate user CPU maps intersecting
core PMU maps") intersect the requested CPU map with the CPU map of the
PMU. Use the evsel's cpus to replace user_requested_cpus.

The evlist's threads are also propagated to the evsel's threads in
__perf_evlist__propagate_maps(). For a system-wide event, perf appends
a dummy event and assign it to the evsel's threads. For a per-thread
event, the evlist's thread_map is assigned to the evsel's threads. The
same as the other tools, e.g., perf record, using the evsel's threads
when opening an event.

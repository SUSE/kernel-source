Subject: drm/tidss: Use DRM_PLANE_COMMIT_ACTIVE_ONLY
Git-commit: ca89b69734f92021e25899dff3e433b1904f5832
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

At the moment the driver does not use DRM_PLANE_COMMIT_ACTIVE_ONLY, but
still checks for crtc->state->active in tidss_crtc_atomic_flush(), and
skips the flush if the crtc is not active.

The exact reason why DRM_PLANE_COMMIT_ACTIVE_ONLY is not used has been
lost in history. DRM_PLANE_COMMIT_ACTIVE_ONLY does also affect the plane
updates, and I think the issue was related to multi-display systems and
moving planes between the displays. However, it is possible the issue
was only present on the older DSS hardware, handled by the omapdrm
driver (on which the tidss driver is loosely based).

Reviewing the code related to DRM_PLANE_COMMIT_ACTIVE_ONLY does not show
any issues, and testing on J7 EVM with two displays works fine.

Change the driver to use DRM_PLANE_COMMIT_ACTIVE_ONLY.

Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc4

A recent commit expanding the scope of the udc_lock mutex in the
gadget core managed to cause an obscure and slightly bizarre lockdep
violation.  In abbreviated form:

======================================================
WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
5.19.0-rc7+ #12510 Not tainted
------------------------------------------------------
udevadm/312 is trying to acquire lock:
ffff80000aae1058 (udc_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: usb_udc_uevent+0x54/0xe0

but task is already holding lock:
ffff000002277548 (kn->active#4){++++}-{0:0}, at: kernfs_seq_start+0x34/0xe0

which lock already depends on the new lock.

the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:

Evidently this was caused by the scope of udc_mutex being too large.
The mutex is only meant to protect udc->driver along with a few other
things.  As far as I can tell, there's no reason for the mutex to be
held while the gadget core calls a gadget driver's ->bind or ->unbind
routine, or while a UDC is being started or stopped.  (This accounts
for link #1 in the chain above, where the mutex is held while the
dwc2_hsotg_udc is started as part of driver probing.)

Gadget drivers' ->disconnect callbacks are problematic.  Even though
usb_gadget_disconnect() will now acquire the udc_mutex, there's a
window in usb_gadget_bind_driver() between the times when the mutex is
released and the ->bind callback is invoked.  If a disconnect occurred
during that window, we could call the driver's ->disconnect routine
before its ->bind routine.  To prevent this from happening, it will be
necessary to prevent a UDC from connecting while it has no gadget
driver.  This should be done already but it doesn't seem to be;
currently usb_gadget_connect() has no check for this.  Such a check
will have to be added later.

Some degree of mutual exclusion is required in soft_connect_store(),
which can dereference udc->driver at arbitrary times since it is a
sysfs callback.  The solution here is to acquire the gadget's device
lock rather than the udc_mutex.  Since the driver core guarantees that
the device lock is always held during driver binding and unbinding,
this will make the accesses in soft_connect_store() mutually exclusive
with any changes to udc->driver.

Lastly, it turns out there is one place which should hold the
udc_mutex but currently does not: The function_show() routine needs
protection while it dereferences udc->driver.  The missing lock and
unlock calls are added.

Subject: [PATCH] r8152: Increase USB control msg timeout to 5000ms as per spec
Git-commit: a5feba71ec9c14a54c3babdc732c5b6866d8ee43
Patch-mainline: v6.6
References: git-fixes

According to the comment next to USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT and
USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT, although sending/receiving control messages is
usually quite fast, the spec allows them to take up to 5 seconds.
Let's increase the timeout in the Realtek driver from 500ms to 5000ms
(using the #defines) to account for this.

This is not just a theoretical change. The need for the longer timeout
was seen in testing. Specifically, if you drop a sc7180-trogdor based
Chromebook into the kdb debugger and then "go" again after sitting in
the debugger for a while, the next USB control message takes a long
time. Out of ~40 tests the slowest USB control message was 4.5
seconds.

While dropping into kdb is not exactly an end-user scenario, the above
is similar to what could happen due to an temporary interrupt storm,
what could happen if there was a host controller (HW or SW) issue, or
what could happen if the Realtek device got into a confused state and
needed time to recover.

This change is fairly critical since the r8152 driver in Linux doesn't
expect register reads/writes (which are backed by USB control
messages) to fail.

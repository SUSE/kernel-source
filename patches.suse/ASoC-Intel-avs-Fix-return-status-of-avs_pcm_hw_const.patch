Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: Intel: avs: Fix return status of avs_pcm_hw_constraints_init()

References: stable-fixes

Check for return code from avs_pcm_hw_constraints_init() in
avs_dai_fe_startup() only checks if value is different from 0. Currently
function can return positive value, change it to return 0 on success.

I've observed KASAN on our setups and while patch itself is correct
regardless. Problem seems to be caused by recent changes to rates, as
this started happening after recent patchsets and doesn't reproduce with
those reverted

I've tested using Mark tree, where they are both applied and for some
reason snd_pcm_hw_constraint_minmax() started returning positive value,
while previously it returned 0. I'm bit worried if it signals some
potential deeper problem regarding constraints with above changes.

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: silence the warning when evicting inode with
 dioread_nolock
Git-commit: bc12ac98ea2e1b70adc6478c8b473a0003b659d3
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: bsc#1206889

When evicting an inode with default dioread_nolock, it could be raced by
the unwritten extents converting kworker after writeback some new
allocated dirty blocks. It convert unwritten extents to written, the
extents could be merged to upper level and free extent blocks, so it
could mark the inode dirty again even this inode has been marked
I_FREEING. But the inode->i_io_list check and warning in
ext4_evict_inode() missing this corner case. Fortunately,
ext4_evict_inode() will wait all extents converting finished before this
check, so it will not lead to inode use-after-free problem, every thing
is OK besides this warning. The WARN_ON_ONCE was originally designed
for finding inode use-after-free issues in advance, but if we add
current dioread_nolock case in, it will become not quite useful, so fix
this warning by just remove this check.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6qp: add missing properties for sram
Git-commit: 088fe5237435ee2f7ed4450519b2ef58b94c832f

All 3 properties are required by sram.yaml. Fixes the dtbs_check warning:
Sram@940000: '#address-cells' is a required property
Sram@940000: '#size-cells' is a required property
Sram@940000: 'ranges' is a required property

GC is a large block that plays a vital role for amdgpu; for this reason,
this commit creates one specific page for GC and adds extra information
about the CP component.

+ drm/amdgpu - Graphics and Compute (GC)
+========================================
+
+The relationship between the CPU and GPU can be described as the
+producer-consumer problem, where the CPU fills out a buffer with operations
+(producer) to be executed by the GPU (consumer). The requested operations in
+the buffer are called Command Packets, which can be summarized as a compressed
+way of transmitting command information to the graphics controller.
+
+The component that acts as the front end between the CPU and the GPU is called
+the Command Processor (CP). This component is responsible for providing greater
+flexibility to the GC since CP makes it possible to program various aspects of
+the GPU pipeline. CP also coordinates the communication between the CPU and GPU
+via a mechanism named **Ring Buffers**, where the CPU appends information to
+the buffer while the GPU removes operations. It is relevant to highlight that a
+CPU can add a pointer to the Ring Buffer that points to another region of
+memory outside the Ring Buffer, and CP can handle it; this mechanism is called
+**Indirect Buffer (IB)**. CP receives and parses the Command Streams (CS), and
+writes the operations to the correct hardware blocks.

+Graphics (GFX) and Compute Microcontrollers
+-------------------------------------------
+
+GC is a large block, and as a result, it has multiple firmware associated with
+it. Some of them are:

+

+        GFX/compute engine.
+

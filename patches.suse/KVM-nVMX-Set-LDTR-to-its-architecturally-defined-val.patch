Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Set LDTR to its architecturally defined value on
 nested VM-Exit

Set L1's LDTR on VM-Exit per the Intel SDM:

  The host-state area does not contain a selector field for LDTR. LDTR is
  established as follows on all VM exits: the selector is cleared to
  0000H, the segment is marked unusable and is otherwise undefined
  (although the base address is always canonical).

This is likely a benign bug since the LDTR is unusable, as it means the
L1 VMM is conditioned to reload its LDTR in order to function properly on
bare metal.

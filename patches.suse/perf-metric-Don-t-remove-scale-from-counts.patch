Subject: perf metric: Don't remove scale from counts
Git-commit: 6d6be5eb45b423a37d746d3ee0fd0c78f76ead9f
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

Counts were switched from the scaled saved value form to the
aggregated count to avoid double accounting. When this happened the
removing of scaling for a count should have been removed, however, it
wasn't and this wasn't observed as it normally doesn't matter because
a counter's scale is 1. A problem was observed with RAPL events that
are scaled.

Fixes: 37cc8ad77cf8 ("perf metric: Directly use counts rather than saved_value")

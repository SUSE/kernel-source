Subject: genirq/irqdesc: Don't try to remove non-existing sysfs files
Git-commit: 9049e1ca41983ab773d7ea244bee86d7835ec9f5
Patch-mainline: 6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

Fault injection tests trigger warnings like this:

  kernfs: can not remove 'chip_name', no directory
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 253 at fs/kernfs/dir.c:1616 kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xce/0xe0
  RIP: 0010:kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xce/0xe0
  Call Trace:
   <TASK>

   sysfs_remove_group+0x68/0xe0

   __kobject_del+0x45/0xc0
   kobject_del+0x29/0x40
   free_desc+0x42/0x70
   irq_free_descs+0x5e/0x90

The reason is that the interrupt descriptor sysfs handling does not roll
back on a failing kobject_add() during allocation. If the descriptor is
freed later on, kobject_del() is invoked with a not added kobject resulting
in the above warnings.

A proper rollback in case of a kobject_add() failure would be the straight
forward solution. But this is not possible due to the way how interrupt
descriptor sysfs handling works.

Interrupt descriptors are allocated before sysfs becomes available. So the
sysfs files for the early allocated descriptors are added later in the boot
process. At this point there can be nothing useful done about a failing
kobject_add(). For consistency the interrupt descriptor allocation always
treats kobject_add() failures as non-critical and just emits a warning.

To solve this problem, keep track in the interrupt descriptor whether
kobject_add() was successful or not and make the invocation of
kobject_del() conditional on that.

[ tglx: Massage changelog, comments and use a state bit. ]

Subject: drm/todo: Add atomic modesetting references
Git-commit: 755d20ebc44759315f1602813e0ff6caade92168
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

The section about converting existing KMS drivers to atomic modesetting
mentions the existence of a conversion guide, but does not reference it.
While the guide is old and rusty, it still contains useful information,
so add a link to it.  Also link to the LWN.net articles that give an
overview about the atomic mode setting design.

While at it, remove the reference to unconverted virtual HW drivers, as
they've been converted.

 As part of this drivers also need to convert to universal plane (which means
 exposing primary & cursor as proper plane objects). But that's much easier to
 do by directly using the new atomic helper driver callbacks.

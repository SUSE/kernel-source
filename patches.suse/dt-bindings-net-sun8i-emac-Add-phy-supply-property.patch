Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: net: sun8i-emac: Add phy-supply property
Git-commit: a3542b0ccd58f9fd42f34afa9daea435279a7c1c
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc3
References: git-fixes

This property has always been supported by the Linux driver; see
commit 9f93ac8d4085 ("net-next: stmmac: Add dwmac-sun8i"). In fact, the
original driver submission includes the phy-supply code but no mention
of it in the binding, so the omission appears to be accidental. In
addition, the property is documented in the binding for the previous
hardware generation, allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac.

Document phy-supply in the binding to fix devicetree validation for the
25+ boards that already use this property.

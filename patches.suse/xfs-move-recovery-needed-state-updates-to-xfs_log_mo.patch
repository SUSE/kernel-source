Subject: [PATCH] xfs: move recovery needed state updates to
 xfs_log_mount_finish
Git-commit: fd67d8a07208ab06560287b7b9334c2d50b7d6d7
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1193791

xfs_log_mount_finish() needs to know if recovery is needed or not to
make decisions on whether to flush the log and AIL.  Move the
handling of the NEED_RECOVERY state out to this function rather than
needing a temporary variable to store this state over the call to
xlog_recover_finish().

Subject: [PATCH] resource: fix false warning in __request_region()
Git-commit: 91a229bb7ba86b2592c3f18c54b7b2c5e6fe0f95
Patch-mainline: v6.16
References: git-fixes

A warning is raised when __request_region() detects a conflict with a
resource whose resource.desc is IORES_DESC_DEVICE_PRIVATE_MEMORY.

But this warning is only valid for iomem_resources.
The hmem device resource uses resource.desc as the numa node id, which can
cause spurious warnings.

This warning appeared on a machine with multiple cxl memory expanders.
One of the NUMA node id is 6, which is the same as the value of
IORES_DESC_DEVICE_PRIVATE_MEMORY.

In this environment it was just a spurious warning, but when I saw the
warning I suspected a real problem so it's better to fix it.

This change fixes this by restricting the warning to only iomem_resource.
This also adds a missing new line to the warning message.

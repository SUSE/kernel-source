Subject: drm/xe/guc: Fix typos in VF CFG KLVs descriptions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 7547a23cae4145836dbb94522453af4e7d0ccc92
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

Apart from the obvious spelling typo, use the correct values for
infinity quantum/timeout settings (it's 0x0 instead of 0xFFFFFFFF).

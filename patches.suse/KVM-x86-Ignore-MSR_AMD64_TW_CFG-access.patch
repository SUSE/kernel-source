Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Ignore MSR_AMD64_TW_CFG access

Hyper-V enabled Windows Server 2022 KVM VM cannot be started on Zen1 Ryzen
since it crashes at boot with SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED +
STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION (in other words, because of an unexpected #GP
in the guest kernel).

This is because Windows tries to set bit 8 in MSR_AMD64_TW_CFG and can't
handle receiving a #GP when doing so.

Give this MSR the same treatment that commit 2e32b7190641
("x86, kvm: Add MSR_AMD64_BU_CFG2 to the list of ignored MSRs") gave
MSR_AMD64_BU_CFG2 under justification that this MSR is baremetal-relevant
only.
Although apparently it was then needed for Linux guests, not Windows as in
this case.

With this change, the aforementioned guest setup is able to finish booting
successfully.

This issue can be reproduced either on a Summit Ridge Ryzen (with
just "-cpu host") or on a Naples EPYC (with "-cpu host,stepping=1" since
EPYC is ordinarily stepping 2).

Alternatively, userspace could solve the problem by using MSR filters, but
forcing every userspace to define a filter isn't very friendly and doesn't
add much, if any, value.  The only potential hiccup is if one of these
"baremetal-only" MSRs ever requires actual emulation and/or has F/M/S
specific behavior.  But if that happens, then KVM can still punt *that*
handling to userspace since userspace MSR filters "win" over KVM's default
handling.

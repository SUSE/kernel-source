Subject: [PATCH] swim3: mark swim3_init() static
Git-commit: d21fed50c523d87af6456697ad09378060c4f09a
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: bsc#1216436

This is the module init function, which by definition is used only
locally, so mark it static to avoid a warning:

drivers/block/swim3.c:1280:5: error: no previous prototype for 'swim3_init' [-Werror=missing-prototypes]

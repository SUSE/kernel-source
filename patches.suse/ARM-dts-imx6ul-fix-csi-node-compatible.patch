Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6ul: fix csi node compatible
Git-commit: e0aca931a2c7c29c88ebf37f9c3cd045e083483d
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

"fsl,imx6ul-csi" was never listed as compatible to "fsl,imx7-csi", neither
in yaml bindings, nor previous txt binding. Remove the imx7 part. Fixes
the dt schema check warning:
Csi@21c4000: compatible: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
['fsl,imx6ul-csi', 'fsl,imx7-csi'] is too long
Additional items are not allowed ('fsl,imx7-csi' was unexpected)
'fsl,imx8mm-csi' was expected

Subject: [PATCH] docs: submitting-patches: Fix crossref to 'The canonical patch format'
Git-commit: 6d5aa418b3bd42cdccc36e94ee199af423ef7c84
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

The reference to `explicit_in_reply_to` is pointless as when the
reference was added in the form of "#15" [1], Section 15) was "The
canonical patch format".
The reference of "#15" had not been properly updated in a couple of
reorganizations during the plain-text SubmittingPatches era.

Fix it by using `the_canonical_patch_format`.

 The maintainer will thank you if you write your patch description in a
 form which can be easily pulled into Linux's source code management
-system, ``git``, as a "commit log".  See :ref:`explicit_in_reply_to`.

 Solve only one problem per patch.  If your description starts to get
 long, that's a sign that you probably need to split up your patch.

Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: davinci: Rewrite function description
Git-commit: 0697f8441faad552fbeb02d74454b5e7bcc956a2
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

The original comment that describes the function
nand_davinci_read_page_hwecc_oob_first() is very obscure and it is hard
to understand what it is for.

Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v5.2
Fixes: a0ac778eb82c ("mtd: rawnand: ingenic: Add support for the JZ4740")

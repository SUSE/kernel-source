Subject: [PATCH] iomap: lift zeroed mapping handling into iomap_zero_range()
Git-commit: 889ac75787cbeb129df7faf917ce7d53a32ea696
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14161

In preparation for special handling of subranges, lift the zeroed
mapping logic from the iterator into the caller. Since this puts the
pagecache dirty check and flushing in the same place, streamline the
comments a bit as well.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtl8xxxu: gen2: Turn on the rate control
Git-commit: 791082ec0ab843e0be07c8ce3678e4c2afd2e33d
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

Re-enable the function rtl8xxxu_gen2_report_connect.

It informs the firmware when connecting to a network. This makes the
firmware enable the rate control, which makes the upload faster.

It also informs the firmware when disconnecting from a network. In the
past this made reconnecting impossible because it was sending the
auth on queue 0x7 (TXDESC_QUEUE_VO) instead of queue 0x12
(txdesc_queue_mgnt): 

Wlp0s20f0u3: send auth to 90:55:de:__:__:__ (try 1/3)
Wlp0s20f0u3: send auth to 90:55:de:__:__:__ (try 2/3)
Wlp0s20f0u3: send auth to 90:55:de:__:__:__ (try 3/3)
Wlp0s20f0u3: authentication with 90:55:de:__:__:__ timed out

Probably the firmware disables the unnecessary TX queues when it
knows it's disconnected.

However, this was fixed in commit edd5747aa12e ("wifi: rtl8xxxu: Fix
skb misuse in TX queue selection").

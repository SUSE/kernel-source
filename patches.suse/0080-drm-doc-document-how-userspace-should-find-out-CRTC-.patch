Subject: drm/doc: document how userspace should find out CRTC index
Git-commit: 26594678d00f94c62f2e43162bd6d10fd0b74917
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

In this patch we add a section to document what userspace should do to
find out the CRTC index. This is important as they may be many places in
the documentation that need this, so it's better to just point to this
section and avoid repetition.

+CRTC index
+----------
+
+CRTC's have both an object ID and an index, and they are not the same thing.
+The index is used in cases where a densely packed identifier for a CRTC is
+needed, for instance a bitmask of CRTC's. The member possible_crtcs of struct
+drm_mode_get_plane is an example.
+
+DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETRESOURCES populates a structure with an array of CRTC ID's,
+and the CRTC index is its position in this array.

Subject: iommu: Don't reserve 0-length IOVA region
Git-commit: bb57f6705960bebeb832142ce9abf43220c3eab1
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

When the bootloader/firmware doesn't setup the framebuffers, their
address and size are 0 in "iommu-addresses" property. If IOVA region is
reserved with 0 length, then it ends up corrupting the IOVA rbtree with
an entry which has pfn_hi < pfn_lo.
If we intend to use display driver in kernel without framebuffer then
it's causing the display IOMMU mappings to fail as entire valid IOVA
space is reserved when address and length are passed as 0.
An ideal solution would be firmware removing the "iommu-addresses"
property and corresponding "memory-region" if display is not present.
But the kernel should be able to handle this by checking for size of
IOVA region and skipping the IOVA reservation if size is 0. Also, add
a warning if firmware is requesting 0-length IOVA region reservation.

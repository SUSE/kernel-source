Subject: bpf: Add KF_RCU flag to bpf_refcount_acquire_impl
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux
Git-commit: 1500a5d9f49cb66906d3ea1c9158df25cc41dd40
References: jsc#PED-6811
X-Info: modified context due to 36d8bdf75a93 "bpf: Add alloc/xchg/direct_access support for local percpu kptr" not backported

Refcounted local kptrs are kptrs to user-defined types with a
bpf_refcount field. Recent commits ([0], [1]) modified the lifetime of
refcounted local kptrs such that the underlying memory is not reused
until RCU grace period has elapsed.

Separately, verification of bpf_refcount_acquire calls currently
succeeds for MAYBE_NULL non-owning reference input, which is a problem
as bpf_refcount_acquire_impl has no handling for this case.

This patch takes advantage of aforementioned lifetime changes to tag
bpf_refcount_acquire_impl kfunc KF_RCU, thereby preventing MAYBE_NULL
input to the kfunc. The KF_RCU flag applies to all kfunc params; it's
fine for it to apply to the void *meta__ign param as that's populated by
the verifier and is tagged __ign regardless.

  [0]: commit 7e26cd12ad1c ("bpf: Use bpf_mem_free_rcu when
       bpf_obj_dropping refcounted nodes") is the actual change to
       allocation behaivor
  [1]: commit 0816b8c6bf7f ("bpf: Consider non-owning refs to refcounted
       nodes RCU protected") modified verifier understanding of
       refcounted local kptrs to match [0]'s changes

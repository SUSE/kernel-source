Subject: ntsync: No longer depend on BROKEN.
Git-commit: c301e1fefc2d6c83a2beb47e9cdd7b59a90b0067
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: bsc#1234429

f5b335dc025cfee90957efa90dc72fada0d5abb4 ("misc: ntsync: mark driver as "broken"
to prevent from building") was committed to avoid the driver being used while
only part of its functionality was released. Since the rest of the functionality
has now been committed, revert this.

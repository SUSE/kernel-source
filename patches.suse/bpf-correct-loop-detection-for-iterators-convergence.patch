Subject: bpf: correct loop detection for iterators convergence
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
Git-commit: 2a0992829ea3864939d917a5c7b48be6629c6217
References: bsc#1225903

It turns out that .branches > 0 in is_state_visited() is not a
sufficient condition to identify if two verifier states form a loop
when iterators convergence is computed. This commit adds logic to
distinguish situations like below:

 (I)            initial       (II)            initial
                  |                             |
                  V                             V
     .---------> hdr                           ..
     |            |                             |
     |            V                             V
     |    .------...                    .------..
     |    |       |                     |       |
     |    V       V                     V       V
     |   ...     ...               .-> hdr     ..
     |    |       |                |    |       |
     |    V       V                |    V       V
     |   succ <- cur               |   succ <- cur
     |    |                        |    |
     |    V                        |    V
     |   ...                       |   ...
     |    |                        |    |
     '----'                        '----'

For both (I) and (II) successor 'succ' of the current state 'cur' was
previously explored and has branches count at 0. However, loop entry
'hdr' corresponding to 'succ' might be a part of current DFS path.
If that is the case 'succ' and 'cur' are members of the same loop
and have to be compared exactly.

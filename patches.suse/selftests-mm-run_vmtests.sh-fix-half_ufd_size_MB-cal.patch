Subject: [PATCH] selftests/mm: run_vmtests.sh: fix half_ufd_size_MB calculation
Git-commit: 67a2f86846f244d81601cf2e1552c4656b8556d6
Patch-mainline: v6.14
References: git-fixes

We noticed that uffd-stress test was always failing to run when invoked
for the hugetlb profiles on x86_64 systems with a processor count of 64 or
Bigger: 

  ...
  # ------------------------------------
  # running ./uffd-stress hugetlb 128 32
  # ------------------------------------
  # ERROR: invalid MiB (errno=9, @uffd-stress.c:459)
  ...
  # [FAIL]
  not ok 3 uffd-stress hugetlb 128 32 # exit=1
  ...

The problem boils down to how run_vmtests.sh (mis)calculates the size of
the region it feeds to uffd-stress.  The latter expects to see an amount
of MiB while the former is just giving out the number of free hugepages
halved down.  This measurement discrepancy ends up violating uffd-stress'
assertion on number of hugetlb pages allocated per CPU, causing it to bail
out with the error above.

This commit fixes that issue by adjusting run_vmtests.sh's
half_ufd_size_MB calculation so it properly renders the region size in
MiB, as expected, while maintaining all of its original constraints in
place.

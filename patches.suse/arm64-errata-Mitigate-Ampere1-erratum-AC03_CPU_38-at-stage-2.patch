Subject: arm64: errata: Mitigate Ampere1 erratum AC03_CPU_38 at stage-2
Git-commit: 6df696cd9bc1ceed0e92e36908f88bbd16d18255
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

AmpereOne has an erratum in its implementation of FEAT_HAFDBS that
required disabling the feature on the design. This was done by reporting
the feature as not implemented in the ID register, although the
corresponding control bits were not actually RES0. This does not align
well with the requirements of the architecture, which mandates these
bits be RES0 if HAFDBS isn't implemented.

The kernel's use of stage-1 is unaffected, as the HA and HD bits are
only set if HAFDBS is detected in the ID register. KVM, on the other
hand, relies on the RES0 behavior at stage-2 to use the same value for
VTCR_EL2 on any cpu in the system. Mitigate the non-RES0 behavior by
leaving VTCR_EL2.HA clear on affected systems.

+	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around Ampere
+	  erratum AC03_CPU_38 on AmpereOne.
+
+	  The affected design reports FEAT_HAFDBS as not implemented in
+	  ID_AA64MMFR1_EL1.HAFDBS, but (V)TCR_ELx.{HA,HD} are not RES0
+	  as required by the architecture. The unadvertised HAFDBS
+	  implementation suffers from an additional erratum where hardware
+	  A/D updates can occur after a PTE has been marked invalid.
+
+	  The workaround forces KVM to explicitly set VTCR_EL2.HA to 0,
+	  which avoids enabling unadvertised hardware Access Flag management
+	  at stage-2.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.

Subject: KVM: s390: reduce number of IO pins to 1
Git-commit: 774911290c589e98e3638e73b24b0a4d4530e97c
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc5
References: git-fixes

The current number of KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS results in an order 3
allocation (32kb) for each guest start/restart. This can result in OOM
killer activity even with free swap when the memory is fragmented
enough:

As far as I can tell s390x does not use the iopins as we bail our for
anything other than KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_S390_ADAPTER and the chip/pin is
only used for KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_IRQCHIP. So let us use a small number to
reduce the memory footprint.

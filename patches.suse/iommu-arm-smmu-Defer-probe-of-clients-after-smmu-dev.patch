Subject: [PATCH] iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device
 bound
Git-commit: 229e6ee43d2a160a1592b83aad620d6027084aad
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: CVE-2024-56568 bsc#1235032

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device()
						next_device()
						klist_next()
						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

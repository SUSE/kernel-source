Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix Wifi/Bluetooth on ROCK Pi 4 boards
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.12
Git-commit: ebceec271e552a2b05e47d8ef0597052b1a39449

commit ebceec271e552a2b05e47d8ef0597052b1a39449 upstream.

This patch fixes an issue affecting the Wifi/Bluetooth connectivity on
ROCK Pi 4 boards. Commit f471b1b2db08 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix Bluetooth
on ROCK Pi 4 boards") introduced a problem with the clock configuration.
Specifically, the clock-names property of the sdio-pwrseq node was not
updated to 'lpo', causing the driver to wait indefinitely for the wrong clock
signal 'ext_clock' instead of the expected one 'lpo'. This prevented the proper
initialization of Wifi/Bluetooth chip on ROCK Pi 4 boards.

To address this, this patch updates the clock-names property of the
sdio-pwrseq node to "lpo" to align with the changes made to the bluetooth node.

This patch has been tested on ROCK Pi 4B.

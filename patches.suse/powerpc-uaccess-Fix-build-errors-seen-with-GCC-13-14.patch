Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/uaccess: Fix build errors seen with GCC 13/14

References: bsc#1194869
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc2
Git-commit: 2d43cc701b96f910f50915ac4c2a0cae5deb734c

Building ppc64le_defconfig with GCC 14 fails with assembler errors:

    CC      fs/readdir.o
  /tmp/ccdQn0mD.s: Assembler messages:
  /tmp/ccdQn0mD.s:212: Error: operand out of domain (18 is not a multiple of 4)
  /tmp/ccdQn0mD.s:226: Error: operand out of domain (18 is not a multiple of 4)
  ... [6 lines]
  /tmp/ccdQn0mD.s:1699: Error: operand out of domain (18 is not a multiple of 4)

A snippet of the asm shows:

  # ../fs/readdir.c:210:         unsafe_copy_dirent_name(dirent->d_name, name, namlen, efault_end);
         ld 9,0(29)       # MEM[(u64 *)name_38(D) + _88 * 1], MEM[(u64 *)name_38(D) + _88 * 1]
  # 210 "../fs/readdir.c" 1
         1:      std 9,18(8)     # put_user       # *__pus_addr_52, MEM[(u64 *)name_38(D) + _88 * 1]

The 'std' instruction requires a 4-byte aligned displacement because
it is a DS-form instruction, and as the assembler says, 18 is not a
multiple of 4.

A similar error is seen with GCC 13 and CONFIG_UBSAN_SIGNED_WRAP=y.

The fix is to change the constraint on the memory operand to put_user(),
from "m" which is a general memory reference to "YZ".

The "Z" constraint is documented in the GCC manual PowerPC machine
constraints, and specifies a "memory operand accessed with indexed or
indirect addressing". "Y" is not documented in the manual but specifies
a "memory operand for a DS-form instruction". Using both allows the
compiler to generate a DS-form "std" or X-form "stdx" as appropriate.

The change has to be conditional on CONFIG_PPC_KERNEL_PREFIXED because
the "Y" constraint does not guarantee 4-byte alignment when prefixed
instructions are enabled.

Unfortunately clang doesn't support the "Y" constraint so that has to be
behind an ifdef.

Although the build error is only seen with GCC 13/14, that appears
to just be luck. The constraint has been incorrect since it was first
added.

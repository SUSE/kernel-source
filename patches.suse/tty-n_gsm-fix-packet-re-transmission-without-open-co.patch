Subject: [PATCH] tty: n_gsm: fix packet re-transmission without open control channel
Git-commit: 4fae831b3a71fc5a44cc5c7d0b8c1267ee7659f5
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

In the current implementation control packets are re-transmitted even if
the control channel closed down during T2. This is wrong.
Check whether the control channel is open before re-transmitting any
packets. Note that control channel open/close is handled by T1 and not T2
and remains unaffected by this.

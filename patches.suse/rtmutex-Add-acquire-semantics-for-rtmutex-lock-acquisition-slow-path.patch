Subject: [PATCH] rtmutex: Add acquire semantics for rtmutex lock acquisition
 slow path

References: bnc#1203829
Patch-mainline: queued
Git-commit: 90df6d49d232097b5829b69bdc2ee67f4eb4f609

Jan Kara reported the following bug triggering on 6.0.5-rt14 running dbench
on XFS on arm64.

 kernel BUG at fs/inode.c:625!
 Internal error: Oops - BUG: 0 [#1] PREEMPT_RT SMP
 CPU: 11 PID: 6611 Comm: dbench Tainted: G            E   6.0.0-rt14-rt+ #1

It also affects 6.1-rc7-rt5 and affects a preempt-rt fork of 5.14 so this
is likely a bug that existed forever and only became visible when ARM
support was added to preempt-rt. The same problem does not occur on x86-64
and he also reported that converting sb->s_inode_wblist_lock to
raw_spinlock_t makes the problem disappear indicating that the RT spinlock
variant is the problem.

Which in turn means that RT mutexes on ARM64 and any other weakly ordered
architecture are affected by this independent of RT.

Will Deacon observed:

  "I'd be more inclined to be suspicious of the slowpath tbh, as we need to
   make sure that we have acquire semantics on all paths where the lock can
   be taken. Looking at the rtmutex code, this really isn't obvious to me
   -- for example, try_to_take_rt_mutex() appears to be able to return via
   the 'takeit' label without acquire semantics and it looks like we might
   be relying on the caller's subsequent _unlock_ of the wait_lock for
   ordering, but that will give us release semantics which aren't correct."

Sebastian Andrzej Siewior prototyped a fix that does work based on that
comment but it was a little bit overkill and added some fences that should
not be necessary.

The lock owner is updated with an IRQ-safe raw spinlock held, but the
spin_unlock does not provide acquire semantics which are needed when
acquiring a mutex.

Adds the necessary acquire semantics for lock owner updates in the slow path
acquisition and the waiter bit logic.

It successfully completed 10 iterations of the dbench workload while the
vanilla kernel fails on the first iteration.

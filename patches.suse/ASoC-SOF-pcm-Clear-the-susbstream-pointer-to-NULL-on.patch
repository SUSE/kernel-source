Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: pcm: Clear the susbstream pointer to NULL on close
Git-commit: 46c7b901e2a03536df5a3cb40b3b26e2be505df6
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc4
References: git-fixes

The spcm->stream[substream->stream].substream is set during open and was
left untouched. After the first PCM stream it will never be NULL and we
have code which checks for substream NULLity as indication if the stream is
active or not.
For the compressed cstream pointer the same has been done, this change will
correct the handling of PCM streams.

Fixes: 090349a9feba ("ASoC: SOF: Add support for compress API for stream data/offset")

Subject: [PATCH] usb: typec: ucsi: Set orientation as none when connector is unplugged
Git-commit: f47eba045e6cb97f9ee154c68dbf7c3c756919aa
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc7
References: git-fixes

The current implementation of the ucsi glink client connector_status()
callback is only relying on the state of the gpio. This means that even
when the cable is unplugged, the orientation propagated to the switches
along the graph is "orientation normal", instead of "orientation none",
which would be the correct one in this case.

One of the Qualcomm DP-USB PHY combo drivers, which needs to be aware of
the orientation change, is relying on the "orientation none" to skip
the reinitialization of the entire PHY. Since the ucsi glink client
advertises "orientation normal" even when the cable is unplugged, the
mentioned PHY is taken down and reinitialized when in fact it should be
left as-is. This triggers a crash within the displayport controller driver
in turn, which brings the whole system down on some Qualcomm platforms.
Propagating "orientation none" from the ucsi glink client on the
connector_status() callback hides the problem of the mentioned PHY driver
away for now. But the "orientation none" is nonetheless the correct one
to be used in this case.

So propagate the "orientation none" instead when the connector status
flags says cable is disconnected.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: x86: s2idle: If a new AMD _HID is missing assume Rembrandt
Git-commit: fd894f05cf30956296384b0c4a81892ed21ac1d9
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: bsc#1206224

A mistake was made that only AMDI0007 was set to rev of "2", but
it should have been also set for AMDI008. If an ID is missing from
the _HID table, then assume it matches Rembrandt behavior.

This implicitly means that if any other behavior changes happen
in the future missing IDs must be added to that table.

Subject: iavf: in iavf_down, disable queues when removing the driver
Patch-mainline: v6.6
Git-commit: 53798666648af3aa0dd512c2380576627237a800
References: git-fixes

In iavf_down, we're skipping the scheduling of certain operations if
the driver is being removed. However, the IAVF_FLAG_AQ_DISABLE_QUEUES
request must not be skipped in this case, because iavf_close waits
for the transition to the __IAVF_DOWN state, which happens in
iavf_virtchnl_completion after the queues are released.

Without this fix, "rmmod iavf" takes half a second per interface that's
up and prints the "Device resources not yet released" warning.

Fixes: c8de44b577eb ("iavf: do not process adminq tasks when __IAVF_IN_REMOVE_TASK is set")

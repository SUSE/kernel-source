Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: stm32-dma: fix residue in case of MDMA chaining
Git-commit: 67e13e89742c3b21ce177f612bf9ef32caae6047
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc6
References: git-fixes

In case of MDMA chaining, DMA is configured in Double-Buffer Mode (DBM)
with two periods, but if transfer has been prepared with _prep_slave_sg(),
the transfer is not marked cyclic (=!chan->desc->cyclic). However, as DBM
is activated for MDMA chaining, residue computation must take into account
cyclic constraints.

With only two periods in MDMA chaining, and no update due to Transfer
Complete interrupt masked, n_sg is always 0. If DMA current memory address
(depending on SxCR.CT and SxM0AR/SxM1AR) does not correspond, it means n_sg
should be increased.
Then, the residue of the current period is the one read from SxNDTR and
should not be overwritten with the full period length.

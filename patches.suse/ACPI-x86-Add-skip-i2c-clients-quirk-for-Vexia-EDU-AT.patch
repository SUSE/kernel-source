Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: x86: Add skip i2c clients quirk for Vexia EDU ATLA 10 tablet 5V
Git-commit: 8f62ca9c338aae4f73e9ce0221c3d4668359ddd8
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: stable-fixes

The Vexia EDU ATLA 10 tablet comes in 2 different versions with
significantly different mainboards. The only outward difference is that
the charging barrel on one is marked 5V and the other is marked 9V.

Both ship with Android 4.4 as factory OS and have the usual broken DSDT
issues for x86 Android tablets.

Add a quirk to skip ACPI I2C client enumeration for the 5V version to
complement the existing quirk for the 9V version.

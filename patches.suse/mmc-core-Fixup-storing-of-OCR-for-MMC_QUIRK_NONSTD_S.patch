Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: Fixup storing of OCR for MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO
Git-commit: 8c3e5b74b9e2146f564905e50ca716591c76d4f1
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

The mmc core takes a specific path to support initializing of a
non-standard SDIO card. This is triggered by looking for the card-quirk,
MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO.

In mmc_sdio_init_card() this gets rather messy, as it causes the code to
bail out earlier, compared to the usual path. This leads to that the OCR
doesn't get saved properly in card->ocr. Fortunately, only omap_hsmmc has
been using the MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO and is dealing with the issue, by
assigning a hardcoded value (0x80) to card->ocr from an ->init_card() ops.

To make the behaviour consistent, let's instead rely on the core to save
the OCR in card->ocr during initialization.

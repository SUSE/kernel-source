Subject: [PATCH] mm: vmscan: reduce throttling due to a failure to make
 progress -fix

References: git fixes (mm/vmscan)
Patch-mainline: v5.16
Git-commit: 8008293888188c3923f5bd8a69370dae25ed14e5

Hugh Dickins reported the following

	My tmpfs swapping load (tweaked to use huge pages more heavily
	than in real life) is far from being a realistic load: but it was
	notably slowed down by your throttling mods in 5.16-rc, and this
	patch makes it well again - thanks.

	But: it very quickly hit NULL pointer until I changed that last
	line to

        if (first_pgdat)
                consider_reclaim_throttle(first_pgdat, sc);

The likely issue is that huge pages are a major component of the test
workload.  When this is the case, first_pgdat may never get set if
compaction is ready to continue due to this check

        if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_COMPACTION) &&
            sc->order > PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER &&
            compaction_ready(zone, sc)) {
                sc->compaction_ready = true;
                continue;
        }

If this was true for every zone in the zonelist, first_pgdat would never
get set resulting in a NULL pointer exception.

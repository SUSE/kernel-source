Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: cs42l42: Only report button state if there was a button interrupt
Git-commit: ea75deef1a738d25502cfbb2caa564270b271525
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc5
References: git-fixes

Only report a button state change if the interrupt status shows that
there was a button event.

Previously the code would always drop into the button reporting at the
end of interrupt handling if the jack was present. If neither of the
button report interrupts were pending it would report all buttons
released. This could then lead to a button being reported as released
while it is still pressed.

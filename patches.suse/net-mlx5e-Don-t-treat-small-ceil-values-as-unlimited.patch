Subject: net/mlx5e: Don't treat small ceil values as unlimited in HTB offload
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc3
Git-commit: 736dfe4e68b868829a1e89dfef4a44c1580d4478
References: git-fixes

The hardware spec defines max_average_bw == 0 as "unlimited bandwidth".
max_average_bw is calculated as `ceil / BYTES_IN_MBIT`, which can become
0 when ceil is small, leading to an undesired effect of having no
bandwidth limit.

This commit fixes it by rounding up small values of ceil to 1 Mbit/s.

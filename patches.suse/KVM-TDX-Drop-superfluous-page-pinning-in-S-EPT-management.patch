Subject: KVM: TDX: Drop superfluous page pinning in S-EPT management
Git-commit: ce7b5695397b54677ed827e0d52058daaecad2a1
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Don't explicitly pin pages when mapping pages into the S-EPT, guest_memfd
doesn't support page migration in any capacity, i.e. there are no migrate
callbacks because guest_memfd pages *can't* be migrated.  See the WARN in
kvm_gmem_migrate_folio().

Eliminating TDX's explicit pinning will also enable guest_memfd to support
in-place conversion between shared and private memory[1][2].  Because KVM
cannot distinguish between speculative/transient refcounts and the
intentional refcount for TDX on private pages[3], failing to release
private page refcount in TDX could cause guest_memfd to indefinitely wait
on decreasing the refcount for the splitting.

Under normal conditions, not holding an extra page refcount in TDX is safe
because guest_memfd ensures pages are retained until its invalidation
notification to KVM MMU is completed. However, if there're bugs in KVM/TDX
module, not holding an extra refcount when a page is mapped in S-EPT could
result in a page being released from guest_memfd while still mapped in the
S-EPT.  But, doing work to make a fatal error slightly less fatal is a net
negative when that extra work adds complexity and confusion.

Several approaches were considered to address the refcount issue, including
  - Attempting to modify the KVM unmap operation to return a failure,
    which was deemed too complex and potentially incorrect[4].
  - Increasing the folio reference count only upon S-EPT zapping failure[5].
  - Use page flags or page_ext to indicate a page is still used by TDX[6],
    which does not work for HVO (HugeTLB Vmemmap Optimization).
  - Setting HWPOISON bit or leveraging folio_set_hugetlb_hwpoison()[7].

Due to the complexity or inappropriateness of these approaches, and the
fact that S-EPT zapping failure is currently only possible when there are
bugs in the KVM or TDX module, which is very rare in a production kernel,
a straightforward approach of simply not holding the page reference count
in TDX was chosen[8].

When S-EPT zapping errors occur, KVM_BUG_ON() is invoked to kick off all
vCPUs and mark the VM as dead. Although there is a potential window that a
private page mapped in the S-EPT could be reallocated and used outside the
VM, the loud warning from KVM_BUG_ON() should provide sufficient debug
information. To be robust against bugs, the user can enable panic_on_warn
as normal.

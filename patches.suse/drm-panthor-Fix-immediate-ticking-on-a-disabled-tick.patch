Subject: [PATCH] drm/panthor: Fix immediate ticking on a disabled tick
Git-commit: 4356d21994f4ff5c87305b874939b359f16f6677
Patch-mainline: v7.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

We have a few paths where we schedule the tick work immediately without
changing the resched_target. If the tick was stopped, this would lead
to a remaining_jiffies that's always > 0, and it wouldn't force a full
tick in that case. Add extra checks to cover that case properly.

V2: 
- Fix typo
- Simplify the code as suggested by Steve

V3: 
- Collect R-b

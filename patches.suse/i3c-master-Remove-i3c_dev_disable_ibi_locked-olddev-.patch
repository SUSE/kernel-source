Subject: [PATCH] i3c: master: Remove i3c_dev_disable_ibi_locked(olddev) on device hotjoin
Git-commit: 36faa04ce3d9c962b4b29d285ad07ca29e2988e4
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

When a new device hotjoins, a new dynamic address is assigned.
i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked() identifies that the device was previously
attached to the bus and locates the olddev.

i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()
{
    ...
    olddev = i3c_master_search_i3c_dev_duplicate(newdev);
    ...
    if (olddev) {
        ...
        i3c_dev_disable_ibi_locked(olddev);
        ^^^^^^
        The olddev should not receive any commands on the i3c bus as it
        does not exist and has been assigned a new address. This will
        result in NACK or timeout. So remove it.
    }

    i3c_dev_free_ibi_locked(olddev);
    ^^^^^^^^
    This function internally calls i3c_dev_disable_ibi_locked() function
    causing to send DISEC command with old Address.

    The olddev should not receive any commands on the i3c bus as it
    does not exist and has been assigned a new address. This will
    result in NACK or timeout. So, update the olddev->ibi->enabled
    flag to false to avoid DISEC with OldAddr.
}

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: amd: ps: Fix uninitialized ret in create_acp64_platform_devs()
Git-commit: de1cae22898cf10aacc735a21d799b5bbce4496c
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: bsc#1219136

Clang warns:

  sound/soc/amd/ps/pci-ps.c:218:2: error: variable 'ret' is used uninitialized whenever switch default is taken [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
          default:
          ^~~~~~~
  sound/soc/amd/ps/pci-ps.c:239:9: note: uninitialized use occurs here
          return ret;
                 ^~~
  sound/soc/amd/ps/pci-ps.c:190:9: note: initialize the variable 'ret' to silence this warning
          int ret;
                 ^
                  = 0
  1 error generated.

ret is used uninitialized if 'goto de_init' is taken. As this is not an
error nor should the ACP be deinitialized, just directly return 0 in
this case statement, which resolves the warning.

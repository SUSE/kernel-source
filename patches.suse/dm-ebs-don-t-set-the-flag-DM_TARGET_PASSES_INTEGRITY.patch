Subject: dm-ebs: don't set the flag DM_TARGET_PASSES_INTEGRITY
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc7
Git-commit: 47f33c27fc9565fb0bc7dfb76be08d445cd3d236
References: git-fixes

dm-ebs uses dm-bufio to process requests that are not aligned on logical
sector size. dm-bufio doesn't support passing integrity data (and it is
unclear how should it do it), so we shouldn't set the
DM_TARGET_PASSES_INTEGRITY flag.

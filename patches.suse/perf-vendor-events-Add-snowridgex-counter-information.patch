Subject: perf vendor events: Add snowridgex counter information
Git-commit: 7c79eb5cc226f29cbe6e419c85a9a7010504d0f6
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: perf-sp7-v6.11-userspace-update

Update/remove events as per v1.23:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/9debd874e1b2b0cca42b9ba2342cacaaace2f0ce

Add counter information necessary for optimizing event grouping the
perf tool.

The most recent RFC patch set using this information:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240412210756.309828-1-weilin.wang@intel.com/

The information was added in:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/475892a9690cb048949e593fe39cee65cd4765e1
and later patches.

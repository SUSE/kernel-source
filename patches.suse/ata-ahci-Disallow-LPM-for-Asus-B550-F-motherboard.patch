Subject: [PATCH] ata: ahci: Disallow LPM for Asus B550-F motherboard
Git-commit: a7b3b77fd111d49f8e25624e4ea1046322a57baf
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc3

Asus ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI) motherboard has problems on some
SATA ports with at least one hard drive model (WDC WD20EFAX-68FB5N0)
when LPM is enabled. Disabling LPM solves the issue.

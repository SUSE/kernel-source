Subject: [PATCH] mm,page_owner: Update metadata for tail pages
References: bsc#1222366
Patch-mainline: submitted https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mm/patch/20240404070702.2744-2-osalvador@suse.de/

__set_page_owner_handle() and __reset_page_owner() update the metadata
of all pages when the page is of a higher-order, but we miss to do the
same when the pages are migrated.
__folio_copy_owner() only updates the metadata of the head page, meaning
that the information stored in the first page and the tail pages will not
match.

Strictly speaking that is not a big problem because 1) we do not print
tail pages and 2) upon splitting all tail pages will inherit the
metadata of the head page, but it is better to have all metadata in check
should there be any problem, so it can ease debugging.

For that purpose, a couple of helpers are created
__update_page_owner_handle() which updates the metadata on allocation,
and __update_page_owner_free_handle() which does the same when the page
is freed.

__folio_copy_owner() will make use of both as it needs to entirely replace
the page_owner metadata for the new page.

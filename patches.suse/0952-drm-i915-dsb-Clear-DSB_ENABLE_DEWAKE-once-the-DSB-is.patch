Subject: drm/i915/dsb: Clear DSB_ENABLE_DEWAKE once the DSB is done
MIME-Version: 1.0

Git-commit: 44378f6ef2efee3ccfa87de5860662f2356bdde8
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

In order to avoid the DSB keeping the DEwake permanently
asserted we must clear DSB_PMCTRL_2.DSB_FORCE_DEWAKE once
we are done. For good measure do the same for
DSB_PMCTRL.DSB_ENABLE_DEWAKE.

Experimentally this doens't seem to be actually necessary
(unlike with DSB_FORCE_DEWAKE). That is, the DSB_ENABLE_DEWAKE
doesn't seem to do anything whenever the DSB is not active.
But I'd hate to waste a ton of power in case there I'm wrong
and there is some way DEwake could remaing asserted. One extra
register write is a small price to pay for some peace of mind.

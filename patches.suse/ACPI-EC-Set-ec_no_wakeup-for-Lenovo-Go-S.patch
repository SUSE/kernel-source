Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: EC: Set ec_no_wakeup for Lenovo Go S
Git-commit: b988685388effd648150aab272533f833a2a70f0
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc2
References: stable-fixes

When AC adapter is unplugged or plugged in EC wakes from HW sleep but
APU doesn't enter back into HW sleep.

The reason this happens is that, when the APU exits HW sleep, the power
rails controlled by the EC will power up the TCON.  The TCON has a GPIO
that will be toggled at this time.  The GPIO is not marked as a wakeup
source, but the GPIO controller still has an unserviced interrupt.
Unserviced interrupts will block entering HW sleep again. Clearing the
GPIO doesn't help as the TCON continues to assert it until it's been
initialized by i2c-hid.

Fixing this would require TCON F/W changes and it's already broken in
the wild on production hardware.

To avoid triggering this issue add a quirk to avoid letting EC wake
up system at all.  The power button still works properly on this system.

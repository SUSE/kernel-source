Subject: [PATCH] printk: nbcon: Use driver synchronization while
 (un)registering

References: bsc#1232534 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
Git-commit: e55c3bcf380c7593d768f31994eff63935081d06

Console drivers typically have to deal with access to the
hardware via user input/output (such as an interactive login
shell) and output of kernel messages via printk() calls.

They use some classic driver-specific locking mechanism in most
situations. But console->write_atomic() callbacks, used by nbcon
consoles, are synchronized only by acquiring the console
context.

The synchronization via the console context ownership is possible
only when the console driver is registered. It is when a
particular device driver is connected with a particular console
driver.

The two synchronization mechanisms must be synchronized between
each other. It is tricky because the console context ownership
is quite special. It might be taken over by a higher priority
context. Also CPU migration must be disabled. The most tricky
part is to (dis)connect these two mechanisms during the console
(un)registration.

Use the driver-specific locking callbacks: device_lock(),
device_unlock(). They allow taking the device-specific lock
while the device is being (un)registered by the related console
driver.

For example, these callbacks lock/unlock the port lock for
serial port drivers.

Note that the driver-specific locking is only needed during
(un)register if it is an nbcon console with the write_atomic()
callback implemented. If write_atomic() is not implemented, the
driver should never attempt to access the hardware without
first acquiring its driver-specific lock.

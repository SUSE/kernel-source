Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: loader: Re-phrase the missing firmware error to avoid duplication
Git-commit: 25766ee44ff8db4cdf8471b587dffb28b7b9d17f
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc4
References: bsc#1192354

In case the firmware is missing we will have the following in the kernel
Log: 

1 | Direct firmware load for intel/sof/sof-tgl-h.ri failed with error -2
2 | error: request firmware intel/sof/sof-tgl-h.ri failed err: -2
3 | you may need to download the firmware from https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-bin/
4 | error: failed to load DSP firmware -2
5 | error: sof_probe_work failed err: -2

The first line is the standard, request_firmware() warning.
The second and third line is printed in snd_sof_load_firmware_raw()
Note that the first and second line is mostly identical.

With this patch the log will be changed to:
1 | Direct firmware load for intel/sof/sof-tgl-h.ri failed with error -2
2 | error: sof firmware file is missing, you might need to
3 |        download it from https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-bin/
4 | error: failed to load DSP firmware -2
5 | error: sof_probe_work failed err: -2

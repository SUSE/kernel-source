Subject: perf tests bp_account: Fix leaked file descriptor
Git-commit: 4a6cdecaa1497f1fbbd1d5307a225b6ca5a62a90
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

Since the commit e9846f5ead26 ("perf test: In forked mode add check that
fds aren't leaked"), the test "Breakpoint accounting" reports the error:

  # perf test -vvv "Breakpoint accounting"
  20: Breakpoint accounting:
  --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 373
  failed opening event 0
  failed opening event 0
  watchpoints count 4, breakpoints count 6, has_ioctl 1, share 0
  wp 0 created
  wp 1 created
  wp 2 created
  wp 3 created
  wp 0 modified to bp
  wp max created
  ---- end(0) ----
  Leak of file descriptor 7 that opened: 'anon_inode:[perf_event]'

A watchpoint's file descriptor was not properly released. This patch
fixes the leak.

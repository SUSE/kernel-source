Subject: [PATCH] modpost: fix removing numeric suffixes
Git-commit: b5beffa20d83c4e15306c991ffd00de0d8628338
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

With the `-z unique-symbol` linker flag or any similar mechanism,
it is possible to trigger the following:

Error: modpost: "param_set_uint.0" [vmlinux] is a static EXPORT_SYMBOL

The reason is that for now the condition from remove_dot():

if (m && (s[n + m] == '.' || s[n + m] == 0))

which was designed to test if it's a dot or a '\0' after the suffix
is never satisfied.
This is due to that `s[n + m]` always points to the last digit of a
numeric suffix, not on the symbol next to it (from a custom debug
print added to modpost):

param_set_uint.0, s[n + m] is '0', s[n + m + 1] is '\0'

So it's off-by-one and was like that since 2014.

Fix this for the sake of any potential upcoming features, but don't
bother stable-backporting, as it's well hidden -- apart from that
LD flag, it can be triggered only with GCC LTO which never landed
upstream.

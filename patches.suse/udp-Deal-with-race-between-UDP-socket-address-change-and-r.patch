Subject: udp: Deal with race between UDP socket address change and rehash
Git-commit: a502ea6fa94b1f7be72a24bcf9e3f5f6b7e6e90c
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: CVE-2024-57974 bsc#1238532

If a UDP socket changes its local address while it's receiving
datagrams, as a result of connect(), there is a period during which
a lookup operation might fail to find it, after the address is changed
but before the secondary hash (port and address) and the four-tuple
hash (local and remote ports and addresses) are updated.

Secondary hash chains were introduced by commit 30fff9231fad ("udp:
bind() optimisation") and, as a result, a rehash operation became
needed to make a bound socket reachable again after a connect().

This operation was introduced by commit 719f835853a9 ("udp: add
rehash on connect()") which isn't however a complete fix: the
socket will be found once the rehashing completes, but not while
it's pending.

This is noticeable with a socat(1) server in UDP4-LISTEN mode, and a
client sending datagrams to it. After the server receives the first
datagram (cf. _xioopen_ipdgram_listen()), it issues a connect() to
the address of the sender, in order to set up a directed flow.

Now, if the client, running on a different CPU thread, happens to
send a (subsequent) datagram while the server's socket changes its
address, but is not rehashed yet, this will result in a failed
lookup and a port unreachable error delivered to the client, as
apparent from the following reproducer:

  LEN=$(($(cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default) / 4))
  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=${LEN} of=tmp.in

  while :; do
  	taskset -c 1 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc &
  	sleep 0.1 || sleep 1
  	taskset -c 2 socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:localhost:1337,shut-null
  	wait
  done

where the client will eventually get ECONNREFUSED on a write()
(typically the second or third one of a given iteration):

  2024/11/13 21:28:23 socat[46901] E write(6, 0x556db2e3c000, 8192): Connection refused

This issue was first observed as a seldom failure in Podman's tests
checking UDP functionality while using pasta(1) to connect the
container's network namespace, which leads us to a reproducer with
the lookup error resulting in an ICMP packet on a tap device:

  LOCAL_ADDR="$(ip -j -4 addr show|jq -rM '.[] | .addr_info[0] | select(.scope == "global").local')"

  while :; do
  	./pasta --config-net -p pasta.pcap -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc &
  	sleep 0.2 || sleep 1
  	socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:${LOCAL_ADDR}:1337,shut-null
  	wait
  	cmp tmp.in tmp.out
  done

Once this fails:

  tmp.in tmp.out differ: char 8193, line 29

we can finally have a look at what's going on:

  $ tshark -r pasta.pcap
      1   0.000000           :: ? ff02::16     ICMPv6 110 Multicast Listener Report Message v2

      9   0.168926 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192
     10   0.168959 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192
     11   0.168989 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 4138 60260 ? 1337 Len=4096
     12   0.169010 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 42 60260 ? 1337 Len=0

On the third datagram received, the network namespace of the container
initiates an ARP lookup to deliver the ICMP message.

In another variant of this reproducer, starting the client with:

  strace -f pasta --config-net -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc 2>strace.log &

and connecting to the socat server using a loopback address:

  socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:localhost:1337,shut-null

we can more clearly observe a sendmmsg() call failing after the
first datagram is delivered:

  [pid 278012] connect(173, 0x7fff96c95fc0, 16) = 0
  [...]
  [pid 278012] recvmmsg(173, 0x7fff96c96020, 1024, MSG_DONTWAIT, NULL) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
  [pid 278012] sendmmsg(173, 0x561c5ad0a720, 1, MSG_NOSIGNAL) = 1
  [...]
  [pid 278012] sendmmsg(173, 0x561c5ad0a720, 1, MSG_NOSIGNAL) = -1 ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused)

and, somewhat confusingly, after a connect() on the same socket
succeeded.

Until commit 4cdeeee9252a ("net: udp: prefer listeners bound to an
address"), the race between receive address change and lookup didn't
actually cause visible issues, because, once the lookup based on the
secondary hash chain failed, we would still attempt a lookup based on
the primary hash (destination port only), and find the socket with the
outdated secondary hash.

That change, however, dropped port-only lookups altogether, as side
effect, making the race visible.

To fix this, while avoiding the need to make address changes and
rehash atomic against lookups, reintroduce primary hash lookups as
fallback, if lookups based on four-tuple and secondary hashes fail.

To this end, introduce a simplified lookup implementation, which
doesn't take care of SO_REUSEPORT groups: if we have one, there are
multiple sockets that would match the four-tuple or secondary hash,
meaning that we can't run into this race at all.

v2:
  - instead of synchronising lookup operations against address change
    plus rehash, reintroduce a simplified version of the original
    primary hash lookup as fallback

v1:
  - fix build with CONFIG_IPV6=n: add ifdef around sk_v6_rcv_saddr
    usage (Kuniyuki Iwashima)
  - directly use sk_rcv_saddr for IPv4 receive addresses instead of
    fetching inet_rcv_saddr (Kuniyuki Iwashima)
  - move inet_update_saddr() to inet_hashtables.h and use that
    to set IPv4/IPv6 addresses as suitable (Kuniyuki Iwashima)
  - rebase onto net-next, update commit message accordingly

Subject: [PATCH] iio: adc: ad7124: Disable all channels at probe time

Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc7
References: git-fixes

When during a measurement two channels are enabled, two measurements are
done that are reported sequencially in the DATA register. As the code
triggered by reading one of the sysfs properties expects that only one
channel is enabled it only reads the first data set which might or might
not belong to the intended channel.

To prevent this situation disable all channels during probe. This fixes
a problem in practise because the reset default for channel 0 is
enabled. So all measurements before the first measurement on channel 0
(which disables channel 0 at the end) might report wrong values.

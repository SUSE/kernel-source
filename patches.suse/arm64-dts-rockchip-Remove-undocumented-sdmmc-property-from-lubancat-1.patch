Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Remove undocumented sdmmc property from
 lubancat-1
Git-commit: 43c854c65e47d2f3763345683b06257b4d12e4e3
Patch-mainline: v6.14 or v6.14-rc8 (next release)
References: git-fixes

Property "supports-sd" isn't documented anywhere and is unnecessary for
mainline driver to function. It seems a property used by downstream
kernel was brought into mainline.

This should be reported by dtbs_check, but mmc-controller-common.yaml
defaults additionalProperties to true thus allows it. Remove the
property to clean the devicetree up and avoid possible confusion.

Subject: drm/i915/gt: Clear all bits from GEN12_FF_MODE2
Git-commit: e8f7df163cb40152b757be0f66a9c6b520b3037a
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022 jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

Right now context workarounds don't do a rmw and instead only write to
the register. Since 2 separate programmings to the same register are
coalesced into a single write, this is not problematic for
GEN12_FF_MODE2 since both TDS and GS timer are going to be written
together and the other remaining bits be zeroed.

However in order to fix other workarounds that may want to preserve the
unrelated bits in the same register, context workarounds need to
be changed to a rmw. To prepare for that, move the programming of
GEN12_FF_MODE2 to a single place so the value passed for "clear" can
be all the bits. Otherwise the second workaround would be dropped as
it'd be detected as overwriting a previously programmed workaround.

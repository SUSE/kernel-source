Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Limit sched slice duration

References: bsc#1189999 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
Git-commit: 79ba1e607d68178db7d3fe4f6a4aa38f06805e7b

In presence of a lot of small weight tasks like sched_idle tasks, normal
or high weight tasks can see their ideal runtime (sched_slice) to increase
to hundreds ms whereas it normally stays below sysctl_sched_latency.

2 normal tasks running on a CPU will have a max sched_slice of 12ms
(half of the sched_period). This means that they will make progress
every sysctl_sched_latency period.

If we now add 1000 idle tasks on the CPU, the sched_period becomes
3006 ms and the ideal runtime of the normal tasks becomes 609 ms.
It will even become 1500ms if the idle tasks belongs to an idle cgroup.
This means that the scheduler will look for picking another waiting task
after 609ms running time (1500ms respectively). The idle tasks change
significantly the way the 2 normal tasks interleave their running time
slot whereas they should have a small impact.

Such long sched_slice can delay significantly the release of resources
as the tasks can wait hundreds of ms before the next running slot just
because of idle tasks queued on the rq.

Cap the ideal_runtime to sysctl_sched_latency to make sure that tasks will
regularly make progress and will not be significantly impacted by
idle/background tasks queued on the rq.

Subject: ARM64: Dynamically allocate cpumasks and increase supported CPUs to
 512
Git-commit: 0499a78369adacec1af29340b71ff8dd375b4697
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: jsc#PED-11431

Currently defconfig selects NR_CPUS=256, but some vendors (e.g. Ampere
Computing) are planning to ship systems with 512 CPUs. So that all CPUs on
these systems can be used with defconfig, we'd like to bump NR_CPUS to 512.
Therefore this patch increases the default NR_CPUS from 256 to 512.

As increasing NR_CPUS will increase the size of cpumasks, there's a fear that
this might have a significant impact on stack usage due to code which places
cpumasks on the stack. To mitigate that concern, we can select
CPUMASK_OFFSTACK. As that doesn't seem to be a problem today with
NR_CPUS=256, we only select this when NR_CPUS > 256.

CPUMASK_OFFSTACK configures the cpumasks in the kernel to be
dynamically allocated. This was used in the X86 architecture in the
past to enable support for larger CPU configurations up to 8k cpus.

With that is becomes possible to dynamically size the allocation of
the cpu bitmaps depending on the quantity of processors detected on
bootup. Memory used for cpumasks will increase if the kernel is
run on a machine with more cores.

Further increases may be needed if ARM processor vendors start
supporting more processors. Given the current inflationary trends
in core counts from multiple processor manufacturers this may occur.

There are minor regressions for hackbench. The kernel data size
for 512 cpus is smaller with offstack than with onstack.

Benchmark results using hackbench average over 10 runs of

 	hackbench -s 512 -l 2000 -g 15 -f 25 -P

on Altra 80 Core

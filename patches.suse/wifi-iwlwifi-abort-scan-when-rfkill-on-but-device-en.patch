Subject: [PATCH] wifi: iwlwifi: abort scan when rfkill on but device enabled
Git-commit: 3c6a0b1f0add72e7f522bc9145222b86d0a7712a
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

In RFKILL we first set the RFKILL bit, then we abort scan
(if one exists) by waiting for the notification from FW
and notifying mac80211. And then we stop the device.
But in case we have a scan ongoing in the period of time between
rfkill on and before the device is stopped - we will not wait for the
FW notification because of the iwl_mvm_is_radio_killed() condition,
and then the scan_status and uid_status are misconfigured,
(scan_status is cleared but uid_status not)
and when the notification suddenly arrives (before stopping the device)
we will get into the assert about scan_status and uid_status mismatch.
Fix this by waiting for FW notif when rfkill is on but the device isn't
disabled yet.

Subject: x86: drop bogus "cc" clobber from __try_cmpxchg_user_asm()
Git-commit: 1df931d95f4dc1c11db1123e85d4e08156e46ef9
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc2
References: git-fixes

As noted (and fixed) a couple of times in the past, "=@cc<cond>" outputs
and clobbering of "cc" don't work well together. The compiler appears to
mean to reject such, but doesn't - in its upstream form - quite manage
to yet for "cc". Furthermore two similar macros don't clobber "cc", and
clobbering "cc" is pointless in asm()-s for x86 anyway - the compiler
always assumes status flags to be clobbered there.

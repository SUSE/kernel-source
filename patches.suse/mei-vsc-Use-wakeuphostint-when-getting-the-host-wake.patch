Subject: [PATCH] mei: vsc: Use "wakeuphostint" when getting the host wakeup GPIO
Git-commit: fdb1ada57cf8b8752cdf54f08709d76d74999544
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: git-fixes

The _CRS ACPI resources table has 2 entries for the host wakeup GPIO,
the first one being a regular GpioIo () resource while the second one
is a GpioInt () resource for the same pin.

The acpi_gpio_mapping table used by vsc-tp.c maps the first Gpio ()
resource to "wakeuphost-gpios" where as the second GpioInt () entry
is mapped to "wakeuphostint-gpios".

Using "wakeuphost" to request the GPIO as was done until now, means
that the gpiolib-acpi code does not know that the GPIO is active-low
as that info is only available in the GpioInt () entry.

Things were still working before due to the following happening:

1. Since the 2 entries point to the same pin they share a struct gpio_desc
2. The SPI core creates the SPI device vsc-tp.c binds to and calls
   acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get(). This does use the second entry and sets
   FLAG_ACTIVE_LOW in gpio_desc.flags .
3. vsc_tp_probe() requests the "wakeuphost" GPIO and inherits the
   active-low flag set by acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get()

But there is a possible scenario where things do not work:

1. - 3. happen as above
4. After requesting the "wakeuphost" GPIO, the "resetfw" GPIO is requested
   next, but its USB GPIO controller is not available yet, so this call
   returns -EPROBE_DEFER.
5. The gpio_desc for "wakeuphost" is put() and during this the active-low
   flag is cleared from gpio_desc.flags .
6. Later on vsc_tp_probe() requests the "wakeuphost" GPIO again, but now it
   is not marked active-low.

The difference can also be seen in /sys/kernel/debug/gpio, which contains
the following line for this GPIO:

 gpio-535 (                    |wakeuphost          ) in  hi IRQ ACTIVE LOW

If the second scenario is hit the "ACTIVE LOW" at the end disappears and
things do not work.

Fix this by requesting the GPIO through the "wakeuphostint" mapping instead
which provides active-low info without relying on acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get()
pre-populating this info in the gpio_desc.

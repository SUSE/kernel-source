Subject: [PATCH] mailbox: pcc: Always clear the platform ack interrupt first
Git-commit: cf1338c0e02880cd235a4590eeb15e2039c873bc
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: stable-fixes

The PCC mailbox interrupt handler (pcc_mbox_irq()) currently checks
for command completion flags and any error status before clearing the
interrupt.

The below sequence highlights an issue in the handling of PCC mailbox
interrupts, specifically when dealing with doorbell notifications and
acknowledgment between the OSPM and the platform where type3 and type4
channels are sharing the interrupt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key issue occurs when OSPM tries to acknowledge platform ack
interrupt for a notification which is ready to be read and processed
but the interrupt itself is not yet triggered by the platform.

This ineffective acknowledgment leads to an issue later in time where
the interrupt remains pending as we exit the interrupt handler without
clearing the platform ack interrupt as there is no pending response or
notification. The interrupt acknowledgment order is incorrect.

To resolve this issue, the platform acknowledgment interrupt should
always be cleared before processing the interrupt for any notifications
or response.

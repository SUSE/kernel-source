Subject: panic: do not print uninitialized taint_flags
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE-specific
References: bsc#1172814

In print_tainted(), the taint_flags array is iterated over and a character
is printed depending on whether the taint bit is set (c_true and c_false).
However, since TAINT_NO_SUPPORT is at the end of the taint_flags array, the
uninitialized elements in-between are initialized to 0. Hence, the
character for TAINT_NO_SUPPORT does not get printed as the first 0 in
between serves as the null terminator for the taint string.

Fix that by skipping any uninitialized taint_flag structs in the
taint_flags array.

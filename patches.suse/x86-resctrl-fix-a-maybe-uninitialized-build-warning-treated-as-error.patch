The recent commit

  064855a69003 ("x86/resctrl: Fix default monitoring groups reporting")

caused a RHEL build failure with an uninitialized variable warning
treated as an error because it removed the default case snippet.

The RHEL Makefile uses '-Werror=maybe-uninitialized' to force possibly
uninitialized variable warnings to be treated as errors. This is also
reported by smatch via the 0day robot.

The error from the RHEL build is:

  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/resctrl/monitor.c: In function ‘__mon_event_count’:
  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/resctrl/monitor.c:261:12: error: ‘m’ may be used
  uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    m->chunks += chunks;
              ^~

The upstream Makefile does not build using '-Werror=maybe-uninitialized'.
So, the problem is not seen there. Fix the problem by putting back the
default case snippet.

 [ bp: note that there's nothing wrong with the code and other compilers
   do not trigger this warning - this is being done just so the RHEL compiler
   is happy. ]

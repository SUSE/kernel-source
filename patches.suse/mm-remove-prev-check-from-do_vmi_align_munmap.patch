Subject: mm: remove prev check from do_vmi_align_munmap()
Git-commit: 445a2ea0ef0e0e69812218b2c896a23443466625
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: bsc#1219558

If the prev does not exist, the vma iterator will be set to MAS_NONE,
which will be treated as a MAS_START when the mas_next or mas_find is
used.  In this case, the next caller will be the vma iterator, which
uses mas_find() under the hood and will now do what the user expects.

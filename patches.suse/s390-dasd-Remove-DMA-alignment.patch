Subject: s390/dasd: Remove DMA alignment
Git-commit: 2a07bb64d80152701d507b1498237ed1b8d83866
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc4
References: LTC#208933 bsc#1230426 git-fixes

Description:   s390/dasd: Remove DMA alignment
Symptom:       Unable to write e.g. XFS filesystem to DASDs with blocksizes
               smaller than 4096 bytes.
Problem:       Enabling DMA alignment enforced alignment properties that
               resulted in filesystem errors.
Solution:      The solution to all of this is to revert to the original
               behavior, such that the block size can be respected.
Reproduction:  Set up a DASD device with a blocksize of 512 bytes and write an
               xfs filesystem to it.
               [test@host ~]# lsdasd -l a367 | grep blksz
                blksz:                             512
               [test@host ~]# mkfs.xfs -f /dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.a367-part1
               ...snipped...
               error reading existing superblock: Invalid argument
               mkfs.xfs: pwrite failed: Invalid argument
               libxfs_bwrite: write failed on (unknown) bno 0x70565c/0x100,
               err=22           mkfs.xfs: Releasing dirty buffer to free list!
               found dirty buffer (bulk) on free list!
               mkfs.xfs: pwrite failed: Invalid argument

Upstream-Description:

s390/dasd: Remove DMA alignment

This reverts commit bc792884b76f ("s390/dasd: Establish DMA alignment").

Quoting the original commit:
    linux-next commit bf8d08532bc1 ("iomap: add support for dma aligned
    direct-io") changes the alignment requirement to come from the block
    device rather than the block size, and the default alignment
    requirement is 512-byte boundaries. Since DASD I/O has page
    alignments for IDAW/TIDAW requests, let's override this value to
    restore the expected behavior.

I mentioned TIDAW, but that was wrong. TIDAWs have no distinct alignment
requirement (per p. 15-70 of POPS SA22-7832-13):

   Unless otherwise specified, TIDAWs may designate
   a block of main storage on any boundary and length
   up to 4K bytes, provided the specified block does not
   cross a 4 K-byte boundary.

IDAWs do, but the original commit neglected that while ECKD DASD are
typically formatted in 4096-byte blocks, they don't HAVE to be. Formatting
an ECKD volume with smaller blocks is permitted (dasdfmt -b xxx), and the
problematic commit enforces alignment properties to such a device that
will result in errors, such as:

   [test@host ~]# lsdasd -l a367 | grep blksz
     blksz:				512
   [test@host ~]# mkfs.xfs -f /dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.a367-part1
   meta-data=/dev/dasdc1            isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=230075 blks

            =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=1
            =                       reflink=1    bigtime=1 inobtcount=1 nrext64=1

The original commit omitted the FBA discipline for just this reason,
but the formatted block size of the other disciplines was overlooked.
The solution to all of this is to revert to the original behavior,
such that the block size can be respected. There were two commits [1]
that moved this code in the interim, so a straight git-revert is not
possible, but the change is straightforward.

But what of the original problem? That was manifested with a direct-io
QEMU guest, where QEMU itself was changed a month or two later with
commit 25474d90aa ("block: use the request length for iov alignment")
such that the blamed kernel commit is unnecessary.

[1] commit 0127a47f58c6 ("dasd: move queue setup to common code")
    commit fde07a4d74e3 ("dasd: use the atomic queue limits API")

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix the external mic not being recognised for Acer Swift 1 SF114-32
Git-commit: efb56d84dd9c3de3c99fc396abb57c6d330038b5
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc3
References: git-fixes

If you connect an external headset/microphone to the 3.5mm jack on the
Acer Swift 1 SF114-32 it does not recognize the microphone. This fixes
that and gives the user the ability to choose between internal and
headset mic.

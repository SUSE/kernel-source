Subject: scsi: lpfc: Allow DEVICE_RECOVERY mode after RSCN receipt if in
 PRLI_ISSUE state
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
Git-commit: 9609385dd91b26751019b22ca9bfa4bec7602ae1
References: bsc#1228857

Certain vendor specific targets initially register with the fabric as an
initiator function first and then re-register as a target function
afterwards.

The timing of the target function re-registration can cause a race
condition such that the driver is stuck assuming the remote port as an
initiator function and never discovers the target's hosted LUNs.

Expand the nlp_state qualifier to also include NLP_STE_PRLI_ISSUE because
the state means that PRLI was issued but we have not quite reached
MAPPED_NODE state yet.  If we received an RSCN in the PRLI_ISSUE state,
then we should restart discovery again by going into DEVICE_RECOVERY.

Subject: [PATCH] clk: Remove prepare_lock hold assertion in __clk_release()
Git-commit: 8358a76cfb47c9a5af627a0c4e7168aa14fa25f6
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc5
References: git-fixes

Removing this assertion lets us move the kref_put() call outside the
prepare_lock section. We don't need to hold the prepare_lock here to
free memory and destroy the clk_core structure. We've already unlinked
the clk from the clk tree and by the time the release function runs
nothing holds a reference to the clk_core anymore so anything with the
pointer can't access the memory that's being freed anyway. Way back in
commit 496eadf821c2 ("clk: Use lockdep asserts to find missing hold of
prepare_lock") we didn't need to have this assertion either.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: do not ignore error from btrfs_next_leaf() when
 inserting checksums

We are currently treating any non-zero return value from btrfs_next_leaf()
the same way, by going to the code that inserts a new checksum item in the
tree. However if btrfs_next_leaf() returns an error (a value < 0), we
should just stop and return the error, and not behave as if nothing has
happened, since in that case we do not have a way to know if there is a
next leaf or we are currently at the last leaf already.

So fix that by returning the error from btrfs_next_leaf().

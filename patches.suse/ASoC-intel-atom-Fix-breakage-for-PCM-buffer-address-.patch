Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: intel: atom: Fix breakage for PCM buffer address setup
Git-commit: 65ca89c2b12cca0d473f3dd54267568ad3af55cc
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc7
References: git-fixes

The commit 2e6b836312a4 ("ASoC: intel: atom: Fix reference to PCM
buffer address") changed the reference of PCM buffer address to
substream->runtime->dma_addr as the buffer address may change
dynamically.  However, I forgot that the dma_addr field is still not
set up for the CONTINUOUS buffer type (that this driver uses) yet in
5.14 and earlier kernels, and it resulted in garbage I/O.  The problem
will be fixed in 5.15, but we need to address it quickly for now.

The fix is to deduce the address again from the DMA pointer with
virt_to_phys(), but from the right one, substream->runtime->dma_area.

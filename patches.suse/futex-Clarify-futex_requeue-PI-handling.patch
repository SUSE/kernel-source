Subject: [PATCH] futex: Clarify futex_requeue() PI handling
Git-commit: f6f4ec00b57a2c950235435bff8e888daafad5af
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1190137 bsc#1189998

When requeuing to a PI futex, then the requeue code tries to trylock the PI
futex on behalf of the topmost waiter on the inner 'waitqueue' futex. If
that succeeds, then PI state has to be allocated in order to requeue further
waiters to the PI futex.

The comment and the code are confusing, as the PI state allocation uses
lookup_pi_state(), which either attaches to an existing waiter or to the
owner. As the PI futex was just acquired, there cannot be a waiter on the
PI futex because the hash bucket lock is held.

Clarify the comment and use attach_to_pi_owner() directly. As the task on
which behalf the PI futex has been acquired is guaranteed to be alive and
not exiting, this call must succeed. Add a WARN_ON() in case that fails.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6ul: fix keypad compatible
Git-commit: 7d15e0c9a515494af2e3199741cdac7002928a0e
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

According to binding, the compatible shall only contain imx6ul and imx21
compatibles. Fixes the dt_binding_check warning:
Keypad@20b8000: compatible: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
['fsl,imx6ul-kpp', 'fsl,imx6q-kpp', 'fsl,imx21-kpp'] is too long
Additional items are not allowed ('fsl,imx6q-kpp', 'fsl,imx21-kpp' were
unexpected)
Additional items are not allowed ('fsl,imx21-kpp' was unexpected)
'fsl,imx21-kpp' was expected

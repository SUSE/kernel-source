Subject: arm64: bpf: Only mitigate cBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux
Git-commit: f300769ead032513a68e4a02e806393402e626f8
References: bsc#1242778 CVE-2025-37963 bsc#1243660

Support for eBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users is typically
disabled. This means only cBPF programs need to be mitigated for BHB.

In addition, only mitigate cBPF programs that were loaded by an
unprivileged user. Privileged users can also load the same program
via eBPF, making the mitigation pointless.

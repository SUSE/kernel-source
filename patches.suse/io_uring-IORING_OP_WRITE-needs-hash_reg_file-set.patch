Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: IORING_OP_WRITE needs hash_reg_file set
Git-commit: 7b3188e7ed54102a5dcc73d07727f41fb528f7c8
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: stable-5.14.4

commit 7b3188e7ed54102a5dcc73d07727f41fb528f7c8 upstream.

During some testing, it became evident that using IORING_OP_WRITE doesn't
hash buffered writes like the other writes commands do. That's simply
an oversight, and can cause performance regressions when doing buffered
writes with this command.

Correct that and add the flag, so that buffered writes are correctly
hashed when using the non-iovec based write command.

Subject: [PATCH] uapi: stddef.h: Fix header guard location
Git-commit: 531108ec5b5cd45ec6272a6115e73275baef7d22
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc3
References: bsc#1217382

The #endif for the header guard wasn't at the end of the header. This
was harmless since the define that escaped was already testing for its
own redefinition. Regardless, move the #endif to the correct place.

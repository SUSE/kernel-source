Subject: [PATCH] drm/nouveau: fix typos in comments
Git-commit: 01c2afe7358385a5381835293dfb6901f11b1691
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc3
References: git-fixes

Fixed three spelling mistakes in nouveau_exec.c comments:
 - alloctor -> allocator
 - exectued -> executed
 - depent -> depend

No functional changes.

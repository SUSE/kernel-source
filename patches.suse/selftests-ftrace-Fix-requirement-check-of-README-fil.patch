Subject: [PATCH] selftests/ftrace: Fix requirement check of README file
Git-commit: 210f9df02611cbe641ced3239122b270fd907d86
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: stable-5.14.6

commit 210f9df02611cbe641ced3239122b270fd907d86 upstream.

The selftest for ftrace checks some features by checking if the README has
text that states the feature is supported by that kernel. Unfortunately,
this check gives false positives because it many not be checked if there's
spaces in the string to check. This is due to the compare between the
required variable with the ":README" string stripped, because neither has
quotes around them.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests/seccomp: fix negative_ENOSYS tracer tests on arm32
Git-commit: 73989c998814d82c71d523c104c398925470d59e
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

TRACE_syscall.ptrace.negative_ENOSYS and TRACE_syscall.seccomp.negative_ENOSYS
on arm32 are being reported as failures instead of skipping.

The teardown_trace_fixture function sets the test to KSFT_FAIL in case of a
non 0 return value from the tracer process.
Due to _metadata now being shared between the forked processes the tracer is
returning the KSFT_SKIP value set by the tracee which is non 0.

Remove the setting of the _metadata.exit_code in teardown_trace_fixture.

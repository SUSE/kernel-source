Subject: [PATCH] drm/nouveau/disp: Fix missing backlight control on Macbook 5,
 1
Date: Fri, 17 May 2024 13:07:27 +0200
Message-id: <20240517110853.8481-1-tiwai@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, dri-devel ML
References: bsc#1223838

Macbook 5,1 with MCP79 lost its backlight control since the recent
change for supporting GFP-RM; it rewrote the whole nv50 backlight
control code and each display engine is supposed to have an entry for
IOR bl callback, but it didn't cover mcp77.

This patch adds the missing bl entry initialization for mcp77 display
engine to recover the backlight control.

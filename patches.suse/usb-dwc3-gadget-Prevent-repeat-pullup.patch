Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Prevent repeat pullup()
Git-commit: 69e131d1ac4e52a59ec181ab4f8aa8c48cd8fb64
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Don't do soft-disconnect if it's previously done. Likewise, don't do
soft-connect if the device is currently connected and running. It would
break normal operation.

Currently the caller of pullup() (udc's sysfs soft_connect) only checks
if it had initiated disconnect to prevent repeating soft-disconnect. It
doesn't check for soft-connect. To be safe, let's keep the check here
regardless whether the udc core is fixed.

Subject: ARM: dts: at91: Map MCLK for wm8731 on at91sam9g20ek
Git-commit: 0e486fe341fabd8e583f3d601a874cd394979c45
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc5
References: git-fixes

The MCLK of the WM8731 on the AT91SAM9G20-EK board is connected to the
PCK0 output of the SoC and is expected to be set to 12MHz. Previously
this was mapped using pre-common clock API calls in the audio machine
driver but the conversion to the common clock framework broke that so
describe things in the DT instead.

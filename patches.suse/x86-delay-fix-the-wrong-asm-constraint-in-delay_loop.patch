Subject: x86/delay: Fix the wrong asm constraint in delay_loop()
Git-commit: b86eb74098a92afd789da02699b4b0dd3f73b889
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

The asm constraint does not reflect the fact that the asm statement can
modify the value of the local variable loops. Which it does.

Specifying the wrong constraint may lead to undefined behavior, it may
clobber random stuff (e.g. local variable, important temporary value in
regs, etc.). This is especially dangerous when the compiler decides to
inline the function and since it doesn't know that the value gets
modified, it might decide to use it from a register directly without
reloading it.

Change the constraint to "+a" to denote that the first argument is an
input and an output argument.

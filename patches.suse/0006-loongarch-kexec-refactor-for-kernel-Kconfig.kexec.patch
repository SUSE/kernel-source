Subject: [PATCH 06/15] loongarch/kexec: refactor for kernel/Kconfig.kexec
Git-commit: 19e6dd0b6196f6675c1ed9efac219cb724c018e6
References: jsc#PED-5077
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1

The kexec and crash kernel options are provided in the common
kernel/Kconfig.kexec. Utilize the common options and provide
the ARCH_SUPPORTS_ and ARCH_SELECTS_ entries to recreate the
equivalent set of KEXEC and CRASH options.

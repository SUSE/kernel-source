Subject: [PATCH] HID: i2c-hid: Add IDEA5002 to i2c_hid_acpi_blacklist[]
Git-commit: a9f68ffe1170ca4bc17ab29067d806a354a026e0
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc6
References: git-fixes

Users have reported problems with recent Lenovo laptops that contain
an IDEA5002 I2C HID device. Reports include fans turning on and
running even at idle and spurious wakeups from suspend.

Presumably in the Windows ecosystem there is an application that
uses the HID device. Maybe that puts it into a lower power state so
it doesn't cause spurious events.

This device doesn't serve any functional purpose in Linux as nothing
interacts with it so blacklist it from being probed. This will
prevent the GPIO driver from setting up the GPIO and the spurious
interrupts and wake events will not occur.

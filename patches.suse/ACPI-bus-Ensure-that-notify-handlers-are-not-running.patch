Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: bus: Ensure that notify handlers are not running after removal
Git-commit: faae443738c6f0dac9b0d3d11d108f6911a989a9
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

Currently, acpi_device_remove_notify_handler() may return while the
notify handler being removed is still running which may allow the
module holding that handler to be torn down prematurely.

Address this issue by making acpi_device_remove_notify_handler() wait
for the handling of all the ACPI events in progress to complete before
returning.

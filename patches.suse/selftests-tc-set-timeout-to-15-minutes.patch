Subject: [PATCH] selftests: tc: set timeout to 15 minutes
Git-commit: fda05798c22a354efde09a76bdfc276b2d591829
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc3
References: git-fixes

When looking for something else in LKFT reports [1], I noticed that the
TC selftest ended with a timeout error:

  not ok 1 selftests: tc-testing: tdc.sh # TIMEOUT 45 seconds

The timeout had been introduced 3 years ago, see the Fixes commit below.

This timeout is only in place when executing the selftests via the
kselftests runner scripts. I guess this is not what most TC devs are
using and nobody noticed the issue before.

The new timeout is set to 15 minutes as suggested by Pedro [2]. It looks
like it is plenty more time than what it takes in "normal" conditions.

Fixes: 852c8cbf34d3 ("selftests/kselftest/runner.sh: Add 45 second timeout per test")

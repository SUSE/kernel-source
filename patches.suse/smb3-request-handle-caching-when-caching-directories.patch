Subject: [PATCH] smb3: request handle caching when caching directories
Git-commit: 9ed9d83a51a9636d367c796252409e7b2f4de4d4
References: bsc#1231432
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1

This client was only requesting READ caching, not READ and HANDLE caching
in the LeaseState on the open requests we send for directories.  To
delay closing a handle (e.g. for caching directory contents) we should
be requesting HANDLE as well as READ (as we already do for deferred
close of files).   See MS-SMB2 3.3.1.4 e.g.

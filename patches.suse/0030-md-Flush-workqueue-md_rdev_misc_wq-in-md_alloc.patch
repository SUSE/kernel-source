Subject: [PATCH] md: Flush workqueue md_rdev_misc_wq in md_alloc()
Git-commit: 5e8daf906f890560df430d30617c692a794acb73
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc3
References: jsc#PED-2766

A race condition still exists when removing and re-creating md devices
in test cases. However, it is only seen on some setups.

The race condition was tracked down to a reference still being held
to the kobject by the rdev in the md_rdev_misc_wq which will be released
in rdev_delayed_delete().

md_alloc() waits for previous deletions by waiting on the md_misc_wq,
but the md_rdev_misc_wq may still be holding a reference to a recently
removed device.

To fix this, also flush the md_rdev_misc_wq in md_alloc().

Subject: swiotlb: fix slot alignment checks
Git-commit: 0eee5ae1025699ea93d44fdb6ef2365505082103
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc5
References: bsc#1216559

Explicit alignment and page alignment are used only to calculate
the stride, not when checking actual slot physical address.

Originally, only page alignment was implemented, and that worked,
because the whole SWIOTLB is allocated on a page boundary, so
aligning the start index was sufficient to ensure a page-aligned
slot.

When commit 1f221a0d0dbf ("swiotlb: respect min_align_mask") added
support for min_align_mask, the index could be incremented in the
search loop, potentially finding an unaligned slot if minimum device
alignment is between IO_TLB_SIZE and PAGE_SIZE.  The bug could go
unnoticed, because the slot size is 2 KiB, and the most common page
size is 4 KiB, so there is no alignment value in between.

IIUC the intention has been to find a slot that conforms to all
alignment constraints: device minimum alignment, an explicit
alignment (given as function parameter) and optionally page
alignment (if allocation size is >= PAGE_SIZE). The most
restrictive mask can be trivially computed with logical AND. The
rest can stay.

Fixes: 1f221a0d0dbf ("swiotlb: respect min_align_mask")
Fixes: e81e99bacc9f ("swiotlb: Support aligned swiotlb buffers")

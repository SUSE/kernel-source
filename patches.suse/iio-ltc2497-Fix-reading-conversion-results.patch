Subject: [PATCH] iio: ltc2497: Fix reading conversion results
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 7f4f1096d5921f5d90547596f9ce80e0b924f887
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

After the result of the previous conversion is read the chip
automatically starts a new conversion and doesn't accept new i2c
transfers until this conversion is completed which makes the function
return failure.

So add an early return iff the programming of the new address isn't
needed. Note this will not fix the problem in general, but all cases
that are currently used. Once this changes we get the failure back, but
this can be addressed when the need arises.

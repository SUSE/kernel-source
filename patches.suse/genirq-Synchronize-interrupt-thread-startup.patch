Subject: [PATCH] genirq: Synchronize interrupt thread startup
Git-commit: 8707898e22fd665bc1d7b18b809be4b56ce25bdd
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc6
References: git-fixes

A kernel hang can be observed when running setserial in a loop on a kernel
with force threaded interrupts. The sequence of events is:

   setserial
     open("/dev/ttyXXX")
       request_irq()
     do_stuff()
      -> serial interrupt
         -> wake(irq_thread)
	      desc->threads_active++;
     close()
       free_irq()
         kthread_stop(irq_thread)
     synchronize_irq() <- hangs because desc->threads_active != 0

The thread is created in request_irq() and woken up, but does not get on a
CPU to reach the actual thread function, which would handle the pending
wake-up. kthread_stop() sets the should stop condition which makes the
thread immediately exit, which in turn leaves the stale threads_active
count around.

This problem was introduced with commit 519cc8652b3a, which addressed a
interrupt sharing issue in the PCIe code.

Before that commit free_irq() invoked synchronize_irq(), which waits for
the hard interrupt handler and also for associated threads to complete.

To address the PCIe issue synchronize_irq() was replaced with
__synchronize_hardirq(), which only waits for the hard interrupt handler to
complete, but not for threaded handlers.

This was done under the assumption, that the interrupt thread already
reached the thread function and waits for a wake-up, which is guaranteed to
be handled before acting on the stop condition. The problematic case, that
the thread would not reach the thread function, was obviously overlooked.

Make sure that the interrupt thread is really started and reaches
thread_fn() before returning from __setup_irq().

This utilizes the existing wait queue in the interrupt descriptor. The
wait queue is unused for non-shared interrupts. For shared interrupts the
usage might cause a spurious wake-up of a waiter in synchronize_irq() or the
completion of a threaded handler might cause a spurious wake-up of the
waiter for the ready flag. Both are harmless and have no functional impact.

Subject: [PATCH] mm/userfaultfd: selftests: fix memory corruption with thp enabled
Git-commit: 8913970c19915bbe773d97d42989cd85b7fdc098
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc7
References: stable-5.14.15

commit 8913970c19915bbe773d97d42989cd85b7fdc098 upstream.

In RHEL's gating selftests we've encountered memory corruption in the
uffd event test even with upstream kernel:

        # ./userfaultfd anon 128 4
        nr_pages: 32768, nr_pages_per_cpu: 32768
        bounces: 3, mode: rnd racing read, userfaults: 6240 missing (6240) 14729 wp (14729)
        bounces: 2, mode: racing read, userfaults: 1444 missing (1444) 28877 wp (28877)
        bounces: 1, mode: rnd read, userfaults: 6055 missing (6055) 14699 wp (14699)
        bounces: 0, mode: read, userfaults: 82 missing (82) 25196 wp (25196)
        testing uffd-wp with pagemap (pgsize=4096): done
        testing uffd-wp with pagemap (pgsize=2097152): done
        testing events (fork, remap, remove): ERROR: nr 32427 memory corruption 0 1 (errno=0, line=963)
        ERROR: faulting process failed (errno=0, line=1117)

It can be easily reproduced when global thp enabled, which is the
default for RHEL.

It's also known as a side effect of commit 0db282ba2c12 ("selftest: use
mmap instead of posix_memalign to allocate memory", 2021-07-23), which
is imho right itself on using mmap() to make sure the addresses will be
untagged even on arm.

The problem is, for each test we allocate buffers using two
allocate_area() calls.  We assumed these two buffers won't affect each
other, however they could, because mmap() could have found that the two
buffers are near each other and having the same VMA flags, so they got
merged into one VMA.

It won't be a big problem if thp is not enabled, but when thp is
agressively enabled it means when initializing the src buffer it could
accidentally setup part of the dest buffer too when there's a shared THP
that overlaps the two regions.  Then some of the dest buffer won't be
able to be trapped by userfaultfd missing mode, then it'll cause memory
corruption as described.

To fix it, do release_pages() after initializing the src buffer.

Since the previous two release_pages() calls are after
uffd_test_ctx_clear() which will unmap all the buffers anyway (which is
stronger than release pages; as unmap() also tear town pgtables), drop
them as they shouldn't really be anything useful.

We can mark the Fixes tag upon 0db282ba2c12 as it's reported to only
happen there, however the real "Fixes" IMHO should be 8ba6e8640844, as
before that commit we'll always do explicit release_pages() before
registration of uffd, and 8ba6e8640844 changed that logic by adding
extra unmap/map and we didn't release the pages at the right place.
Meanwhile I don't have a solid glue anyway on whether posix_memalign()
could always avoid triggering this bug, hence it's safer to attach this
fix to commit 8ba6e8640844.

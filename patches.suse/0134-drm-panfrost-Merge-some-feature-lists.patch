Subject: drm/panfrost: Merge some feature lists
Git-commit: 8f54eab0efd55f7e906597d72bf01c6c6f6de510
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

Now that we only list features of interest to kernel space, lots of GPUs
have the same feature bits. To cut down on the repetition in the file,
merge feature lists that are identical between similar GPUs.

Note that this leaves some unmerged identical Bifrost feature lists, as
there are more features affecting Bifrost kernel space that we do not
yet handle.

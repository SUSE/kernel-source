Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: bus: fix const issue in usb_serial_device_match()
Git-commit: 92cd405b648605db4da866f3b9818b271ae84ef0
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

usb_serial_device_match() takes a const pointer, and then decides to
cast it away into a non-const one, which is not a good thing to do
overall.  Fix this up by properly setting the pointers to be const to
preserve that attribute.

Fixes: d69d80484598 ("driver core: have match() callback in struct bus_type take a const *")

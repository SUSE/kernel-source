Subject: [PATCH] media: cedrus: H265: Fix neighbour info buffer size
Git-commit: ee8b887329c78971967506f3ac79b9302c9f83c1
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Neighbour info buffer size needs to be 794 kiB in H6. This is actually
already indirectly mentioned in the comment, but smaller size is used
nevertheless.

Increase buffer size to cover H6 needs. Since increase is not that big
in absolute numbers, it doesn't make sense to complicate logic for older
generations.

Bug was discovered using iommu, which reported access error when trying
to play H265 video.

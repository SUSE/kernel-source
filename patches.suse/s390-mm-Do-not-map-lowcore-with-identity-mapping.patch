Subject: s390/mm: Do not map lowcore with identity mapping
Git-commit: 93f616ff870a1fb7e84d472cad0af651b18f9f87
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc3
References: git-fixes bsc#1249066 CVE-2025-38733 bsc#1249313

Since the identity mapping is pinned to address zero the lowcore is always
also mapped to address zero, this happens regardless of the relocate_lowcore
command line option. If the option is specified the lowcore is mapped
twice, instead of only once.

This means that NULL pointer accesses will succeed instead of causing an
exception (low address protection still applies, but covers only parts).
To fix this never map the first two pages of physical memory with the
identity mapping.

Fixes: 32db401965f1 ("s390/mm: Pin identity mapping base to zero")

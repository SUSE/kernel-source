Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx7d-pico: Use 'clock-frequency'
Git-commit: f4dd0845c4f1f5371f1e06fef0e4a1734a2db964
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc5
References: git-fixes

'clock_frequency' is not a valid property.

Use the correct 'clock-frequency' instead.

Fixes: 8b646cfb84c3 ("ARM: dts: imx7d-pico: Add support for the dwarf baseboard")
Fixes: 6418fd92417f ("ARM: dts: imx7d-pico: Add support for the nymph baseboard")

Subject: [PATCH] dm-zoned: don't set the discard_alignment queue limit
Git-commit: 44d583702f4429763c558624fac763650a1f05bf
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1183

The discard_alignment queue limit is named a bit misleading means the
offset into the block device at which the discard granularity starts.
Setting it to the discard granularity as done by dm-zoned is mostly
harmless but also useless.

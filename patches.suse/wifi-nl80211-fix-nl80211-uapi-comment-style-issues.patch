Subject: [PATCH] wifi: nl80211: fix nl80211 uapi comment style issues
Git-commit: ec3a97d93b88602fffd84ce30a461f6eaeb6f067
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: jsc#PED-10412

Currently kernel-doc raises "warning: bad line:" for several comments
that have invalid multi-line comment style; they are missing the
leading '*'. And checkpatch.pl raises "WARNING: please, no space
before tabs" for a large number of comments which have space then tab
after the leading '*'.

Fix those issues.

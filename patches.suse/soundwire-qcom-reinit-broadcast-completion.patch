Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: qcom: reinit broadcast completion
Git-commit: f936fa7a954b262cb3908bbc8f01ba19dfaf9fbf
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc5
References: git-fixes

For some reason we never reinit the broadcast completion, there is a
danger that broadcast commands could be treated as completed by driver
from previous complete status.
Fix this by reinitializing the completion before sending a broadcast command.

Subject: [PATCH] block: define 'struct bvec_iter' as packed
Git-commit: 19416123ab3e1348b3532347af221d8f60838431
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1183

'struct bvec_iter' is embedded into 'struct bio', define it as packed
so that we can get one extra 4bytes for other uses without expanding
bio.

'struct bvec_iter' is often allocated on stack, so making it packed
doesn't affect performance. Also I have run io_uring on both
nvme/null_blk, and not observe performance effect in this way.

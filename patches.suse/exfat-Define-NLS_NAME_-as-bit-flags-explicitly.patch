Subject: exfat: Define NLS_NAME_* as bit flags explicitly
Git-commit: 1b1a9195ae962fefd8d0785e0af434de1a3447fd
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: bsc#1201725

NLS_NAME_* are bit flags although they are currently defined as enum;
it's casually working so far (from 0 to 2), but it's error-prone and
may bring a problem when we want to add more flag.

This patch changes the definitions of NLS_NAME_* explicitly being bit
flags.

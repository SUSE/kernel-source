Subject: [PATCH] mmc: jz4740: Work around bug on JZ4760(B)
Git-commit: 3f18c5046e633cc4bbad396b74c05d46d353033d
Patch-mainline: v6.2
References: git-fixes

On JZ4760 and JZ4760B, SD cards fail to run if the maximum clock
rate is set to 50 MHz, even though the controller officially does
support it.

Until the actual bug is found and fixed, limit the maximum clock rate to
24 MHz.

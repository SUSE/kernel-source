Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: qgroup: set quota enabled bit if quota disable fails
 flushing reservations
Git-commit: e41c75ca3189341e76e6af64b857c05b68a1d7db
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

Before waiting for the rescan worker to finish and flushing reservations,
we clear the BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED flag from fs_info. If we fail flushing
reservations we leave with the flag not set which is not correct since
quotas are still enabled - we must set back the flag on error paths, such
as when we fail to start a transaction, except for error paths that abort
a transaction. The reservation flushing happens very early before we do
any operation that actually disables quotas and before we start a
transaction, so set back BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED if it fails.

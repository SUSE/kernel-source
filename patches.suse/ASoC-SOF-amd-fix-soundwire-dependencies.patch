Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: amd: fix soundwire dependencies
Git-commit: a3d543b9e6599fbbb9efc1876919627960c5e97a
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9993 jsc#PED-10202

The soundwire-amd driver has a bit of a layering violation requiring
the SOF driver to directly call into its exported symbols rather than
through an abstraction.

The SND_SOC_SOF_AMD_SOUNDWIRE Kconfig symbol tries to deal with the
dependency by selecting SOUNDWIRE_AMD in a complicated set of conditions,
but gets it wrong for a configuration involving SND_SOC_SOF_AMD_COMMON=y,
SND_SOC_SOF_AMD_ACP63=m, and SND_SOC_SOF_AMD_SOUNDWIRE_LINK_BASELINE=m
SOUNDWIRE_AMD=m, which results in a link failure:

Ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: sdw_amd_get_slave_info
>>> referenced by acp-common.c
Ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: amd_sdw_scan_controller
Ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: sdw_amd_probe
Ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: sdw_amd_exit
>>> referenced by acp.c
>>>               sound/soc/sof/amd/acp.o:(amd_sof_acp_remove) in archive vmlinux.a

In essence, the SND_SOC_SOF_AMD_COMMON option cannot be built-in when
trying to link against a modular SOUNDWIRE_AMD driver.

Since CONFIG_SOUNDWIRE_AMD is a user-visible option, it really should
never be selected by another driver in the first place, so replace the
extra complexity with a normal Kconfig dependency in SND_SOC_SOF_AMD_SOUNDWIRE,
plus a top-level check that forbids any of the AMD SOF drivers from being
built-in with CONFIG_SOUNDWIRE_AMD=m.

In normal configs, they should all either be built-in or all loadable
modules anyway, so this simplification does not limit any real usecases.

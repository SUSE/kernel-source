Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed-g6: remove FWQSPID group in pinctrl dtsi
Git-commit: efddaa397cceefb61476e383c26fafd1f8ab6356
Patch-mainline: v5.18
References: git-fixes

FWSPIDQ2 and FWSPIDQ3 are not part of FWSPI18 interface so remove
FWQSPID group in pinctrl dtsi. These pins must be used with the
FWSPI pins that are dedicated for boot SPI interface which provides
same 3.3v logic level.

Subject: [PATCH] docs/conf.py: Cope with removal of language=None in Sphinx 5.0.0
Git-commit: 627f01eab93d8671d4e4afee9b148f9998d20e7c
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

One of the changes in Sphinx 5.0.0 [1] says [sic]:

    5.0.0 final

     - #10474: language does not accept None as it value.
       The default value of language becomes to 'en' now.

[1]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/changes.html#release-5-0-0-released-may-30-2022

It results in a new warning from Sphinx 5.0.0 [sic]:

    WARNING: Invalid configuration value found: 'language = None'.
    Update your configuration to a valid langauge code. Falling
    back to 'en' (English).

Silence the warning by using 'en'.
It works with all the Sphinx versions required for building
kernel documentation (1.7.9 or later).

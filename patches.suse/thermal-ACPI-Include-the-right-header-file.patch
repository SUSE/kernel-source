Subject: [PATCH] thermal: ACPI: Include the right header file
Git-commit: c27d08f786aca71a94b06437d983a5518ec90ee8
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

It is not necessary to include thermal_core.h into thermal_acpi.c,
because none of the code in there depends on anything in the former,
except for the linux/thermal.h, but it is better to include that one
directly instead of including the entire thermal_core.h, so make that
change.

No functional impact.

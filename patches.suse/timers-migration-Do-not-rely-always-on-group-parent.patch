Subject: [PATCH] timers/migration: Do not rely always on group->parent

References: bsc#1232534 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
Git-commit: facd40aa5c4699f94014012e4e58414c082f2c01

When reading group->parent without holding the group lock it is racy
against CPUs coming online the first time and thereby creating another
level of the hierarchy. This is not a problem when this value is read once
to decide whether to abort a propagation or not. The worst outcome is an
unnecessary/early CPU wake up. But it is racy when reading it several times
during a single 'action' (like activation, deactivation, checking for
remote timer expiry,...) and relying on the consitency of this value
without holding the lock. This happens at the moment e.g. in
tmigr_inactive_up() which is also calling tmigr_udpate_events(). Code relys
on group->parent not to change during this 'action'.

Update parent struct member description to explain the above only
once. Remove parent pointer checks when they are not mandatory (like update
of data->childmask). Remove a warning, which would be nice but the trigger
of this warning is not reliable and add expand the data structure member
description instead. Expand a comment, why it is safe to rely on parent
pointer here (inside hierarchy update).

Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dpu: Add missing safe_lut_tbl in sc8280xp catalog
Git-commit: a33b2431d11b4df137bbcfdd5a5adfa054c2479e
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc3
References: git-fixes

During USB transfers on the SC8280XP __arm_smmu_tlb_sync() is seen to
typically take 1-2ms to complete. As expected this results in poor
performance, something that has been mitigated by proposing running the
iommu in non-strict mode (boot with iommu.strict=0).

This turns out to be related to the SAFE logic, and programming the QOS
SAFE values in the DPU (per suggestion from Rob and Doug) reduces the
TLB sync time to below 10us, which means significant less time spent
with interrupts disabled and a significant boost in throughput.

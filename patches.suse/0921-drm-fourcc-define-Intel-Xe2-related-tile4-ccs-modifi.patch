Subject: drm/fourcc: define Intel Xe2 related tile4 ccs modifiers
Git-commit: 5151fa35ae5979821d091b80096b4c790b187bac
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

Add Tile4 type ccs modifiers to indicate presence of compression on Xe2.
Here is defined I915_FORMAT_MOD_4_TILED_LNL_CCS which is meant for
integrated graphics with igpu related limitations
Here is also defined I915_FORMAT_MOD_4_TILED_BMG_CCS which is meant
for discrete graphics with dgpu related limitations

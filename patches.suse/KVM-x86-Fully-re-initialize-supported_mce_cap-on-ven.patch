Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Fully re-initialize supported_mce_cap on vendor
 module load

Effectively reset supported_mce_cap on vendor module load to ensure that
capabilities aren't unintentionally preserved across module reload, e.g.
if kvm-intel.ko added a module param to control LMCE support, or if
someone somehow managed to load a vendor module that doesn't support LMCE
after loading and unloading kvm-intel.ko.

Practically speaking, this bug is a non-issue as kvm-intel.ko doesn't have
a module param for LMCE, and there is no system in the world that supports
both kvm-intel.ko and kvm-amd.ko.

Fixes: c45dcc71b794 ("KVM: VMX: enable guest access to LMCE related MSRs")

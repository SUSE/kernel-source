Subject: [PATCH] ext4: add reserved GDT blocks check
Git-commit: b55c3cd102a6f48b90e61c44f7f3dda8c290c694
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc3
References: bsc#1202712

We capture a NULL pointer issue when resizing a corrupt ext4 image which
is freshly clear resize_inode feature (not run e2fsck). It could be
simply reproduced by following steps. The problem is because of the
resize_inode feature was cleared, and it will convert the filesystem to
meta_bg mode in ext4_resize_fs(), but the es->s_reserved_gdt_blocks was
not reduced to zero, so could we mistakenly call reserve_backup_gdb()
and passing an uninitialized resize_inode to it when adding new group
descriptors.

 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda 3G
 tune2fs -O ^resize_inode /dev/sda #forget to run requested e2fsck
 mount /dev/sda /mnt
 resize2fs /dev/sda 8G

The fix is simple, add a check in ext4_resize_begin() to make sure that
the es->s_reserved_gdt_blocks is zero when the resize_inode feature is
disabled.

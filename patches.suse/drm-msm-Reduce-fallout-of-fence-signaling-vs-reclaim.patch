Subject: drm/msm: Reduce fallout of fence signaling vs reclaim hangs
Git-commit: 4bea53b9c7c72fd12a0ceebe88a71723c0a514b8
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder stable-fixes

Until various PM devfreq/QoS and interconnect patches land, we could
potentially trigger reclaim from gpu scheduler thread, and under enough
memory pressure that could trigger a sort of deadlock.  Eventually the
wait will timeout and we'll move on to consider other GEM objects.  But
given that there is still a potential for deadlock/stalling, we should
reduce the timeout to contain the damage.

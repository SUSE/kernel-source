Subject: [PATCH] nvdimm: make security_show static
Git-commit: 0e796e3eafc5ba450a1f479f22aef4c8a4c7d686
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: jsc#PED-5853

The security_show function is not used outside of drivers/nvdimm/dimm_devs.c
and the attribute it is for is also already static. Silence the sparse
warning for this not being declared by making it static. Fixes:

  drivers/nvdimm/dimm_devs.c:352:9: warning: symbol 'security_show' was not declared. Should it be static?

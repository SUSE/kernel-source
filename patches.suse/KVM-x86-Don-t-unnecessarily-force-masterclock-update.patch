Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Don't unnecessarily force masterclock update on
 vCPU hotplug

Don't force a masterclock update when a vCPU synchronizes to the current
TSC generation, e.g. when userspace hotplugs a pre-created vCPU into the
VM.  Unnecessarily updating the masterclock is undesirable as it can cause
kvmclock's time to jump, which is particularly painful on systems with a
stable TSC as kvmclock _should_ be fully reliable on such systems.

The unexpected time jumps are due to differences in the TSC=>nanoseconds
conversion algorithms between kvmclock and the host's CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
(the pvclock algorithm is inherently lossy).  When updating the
masterclock, KVM refreshes the "base", i.e. moves the elapsed time since
the last update from the kvmclock/pvclock algorithm to the
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW algorithm.  Synchronizing kvmclock with
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW is the lesser of evils when the TSC is unstable, but
adds no real value when the TSC is stable.

Prior to commit 7f187922ddf6 ("KVM: x86: update masterclock values on TSC
writes"), KVM did NOT force an update when synchronizing a vCPU to the
current generation.

    KVM: x86: update masterclock values on TSC writes

    When the guest writes to the TSC, the masterclock TSC copy must be
    updated as well along with the TSC_OFFSET update, otherwise a negative
    tsc_timestamp is calculated at kvm_guest_time_update.

    Once "if (!vcpus_matched && ka->use_master_clock)" is simplified to
    "if (ka->use_master_clock)", the corresponding "if (!ka->use_master_clock)"
    becomes redundant, so remove the do_request boolean and collapse
    everything into a single condition.

Before that, KVM only re-synced the masterclock if the masterclock was
enabled or disabled  Note, at the time of the above commit, VMX
synchronized TSC on *guest* writes to MSR_IA32_TSC:

        case MSR_IA32_TSC:
                kvm_write_tsc(vcpu, msr_info);
                break;

which is why the changelog specifically says "guest writes", but the bug
that was being fixed wasn't unique to guest write, i.e. a TSC write from
the host would suffer the same problem.

So even though KVM stopped synchronizing on guest writes as of commit
0c899c25d754 ("KVM: x86: do not attempt TSC synchronization on guest
writes"), simply reverting commit 7f187922ddf6 is not an option.  Figuring
out how a negative tsc_timestamp could be computed requires a bit more
sleuthing.

In kvm_write_tsc() (at the time), except for KVM's "less than 1 second"
hack, KVM snapshotted the vCPU's current TSC *and* the current time in
nanoseconds, where kvm->arch.cur_tsc_nsec is the current host kernel time
in nanoseconds:

        ns = get_kernel_ns();

        ...

        if (usdiff < USEC_PER_SEC &&
            vcpu->arch.virtual_tsc_khz == kvm->arch.last_tsc_khz) {
                ...
        } else {
                /*
                 * We split periods of matched TSC writes into generations.
                 * For each generation, we track the original measured
                 * nanosecond time, offset, and write, so if TSCs are in
                 * sync, we can match exact offset, and if not, we can match
                 * exact software computation in compute_guest_tsc()
                 *
                 * These values are tracked in kvm->arch.cur_xxx variables.
                 */
                kvm->arch.cur_tsc_generation++;
                kvm->arch.cur_tsc_nsec = ns;
                kvm->arch.cur_tsc_write = data;
                kvm->arch.cur_tsc_offset = offset;
                matched = false;
                pr_debug("kvm: new tsc generation %llu, clock %llu\n",
                         kvm->arch.cur_tsc_generation, data);
        }

        ...

        /* Keep track of which generation this VCPU has synchronized to */
        vcpu->arch.this_tsc_generation = kvm->arch.cur_tsc_generation;
        vcpu->arch.this_tsc_nsec = kvm->arch.cur_tsc_nsec;
        vcpu->arch.this_tsc_write = kvm->arch.cur_tsc_write;

Note that the above creates a new generation and sets "matched" to false!
But because kvm_track_tsc_matching() looks for matched+1, i.e. doesn't
require the vCPU that creates the new generation to match itself, KVM
would immediately compute vcpus_matched as true for VMs with a single vCPU.
As a result, KVM would skip the masterlock update, even though a new TSC
generation was created:

        vcpus_matched = (ka->nr_vcpus_matched_tsc + 1 ==
                         atomic_read(&vcpu->kvm->online_vcpus));

        if (vcpus_matched && gtod->clock.vclock_mode == VCLOCK_TSC)
                if (!ka->use_master_clock)
                        do_request = 1;

        if (!vcpus_matched && ka->use_master_clock)
                        do_request = 1;

        if (do_request)
                kvm_make_request(KVM_REQ_MASTERCLOCK_UPDATE, vcpu);

On hardware without TSC scaling support, vcpu->tsc_catchup is set to true
if the guest TSC frequency is faster than the host TSC frequency, even if
the TSC is otherwise stable.  And for that mode, kvm_guest_time_update(),
by way of compute_guest_tsc(), uses vcpu->arch.this_tsc_nsec, a.k.a. the
kernel time at the last TSC write, to compute the guest TSC relative to
kernel time:

  static u64 compute_guest_tsc(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, s64 kernel_ns)
  {
        u64 tsc = pvclock_scale_delta(kernel_ns-vcpu->arch.this_tsc_nsec,
                                      vcpu->arch.virtual_tsc_mult,
                                      vcpu->arch.virtual_tsc_shift);
        tsc += vcpu->arch.this_tsc_write;
        return tsc;
  }

Except the "kernel_ns" passed to compute_guest_tsc() isn't the current
kernel time, it's the masterclock snapshot!

        spin_lock(&ka->pvclock_gtod_sync_lock);
        use_master_clock = ka->use_master_clock;
        if (use_master_clock) {
                host_tsc = ka->master_cycle_now;
                kernel_ns = ka->master_kernel_ns;
        }
        spin_unlock(&ka->pvclock_gtod_sync_lock);

        if (vcpu->tsc_catchup) {
                u64 tsc = compute_guest_tsc(v, kernel_ns);
                if (tsc > tsc_timestamp) {
                        adjust_tsc_offset_guest(v, tsc - tsc_timestamp);
                        tsc_timestamp = tsc;
                }
        }

And so when KVM skips the masterclock update after a TSC write, i.e. after
a new TSC generation is started, the "kernel_ns-vcpu->arch.this_tsc_nsec"
is *guaranteed* to generate a negative value, because this_tsc_nsec was
captured after ka->master_kernel_ns.

Forcing a masterclock update essentially fudged around that problem, but
in a heavy handed way that introduced undesirable side effects, i.e.
unnecessarily forces a masterclock update when a new vCPU joins the party
via hotplug.

Note, KVM forces masterclock updates in other weird ways that are also
likely unnecessary, e.g. when establishing a new Xen shared info page and
when userspace creates a brand new vCPU.  But the Xen thing is firmly a
separate mess, and there are no known userspace VMMs that utilize kvmclock
*and* create new vCPUs after the VM is up and running.  I.e. the other
issues are future problems.

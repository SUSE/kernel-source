[ Upstream commit 112cedc8e600b668688eb809bf11817adec58ddc ]

If a kernel module gets unloaded then it printed report about a leak before
commit 275678e7a9be ("debugfs: Check module state before warning in
{full/open}_proxy_open()"). An additional check was added in this commit to
avoid this printing. But it was forgotten that the function must return an
error in this case because it was not actually opened.

As result, the systems started to crash or to hang when a module was
unloaded while something was trying to open a file.

Fixes: 275678e7a9be ("debugfs: Check module state before warning in {full/open}_proxy_open()")

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: ti: davinci-mcasp: Fix race condition during probe
Git-commit: d18ca8635db2f88c17acbdf6412f26d4f6aff414
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc7
References: git-fixes

When using davinci-mcasp as CPU DAI with simple-card, there are some
conditions that cause simple-card to finish registering a sound card before
davinci-mcasp finishes registering all sound components. This creates a
non-working sound card from userspace with no problem indication apart
from not being able to play/record audio on a PCM stream. The issue
arises during simultaneous probe execution of both drivers. Specifically,
the simple-card driver, awaiting a CPU DAI, proceeds as soon as
davinci-mcasp registers its DAI. However, this process can lead to the
client mutex lock (client_mutex in soc-core.c) being held or davinci-mcasp
being preempted before PCM DMA registration on davinci-mcasp finishes.
This situation occurs when the probes of both drivers run concurrently.
Below is the code path for this condition. To solve the issue, defer
davinci-mcasp CPU DAI registration to the last step in the audio part of
it. This way, simple-card CPU DAI parsing will be deferred until all
audio components are registered.

Fail Code Path:

Simple-card.c: probe starts
Simple-card.c: simple_dai_link_of: simple_parse_node(..,cpu,..) returns EPROBE_DEFER, no CPU DAI yet
Davinci-mcasp.c: probe starts
Davinci-mcasp.c: devm_snd_soc_register_component() register CPU DAI
Simple-card.c: probes again, finish CPU DAI parsing and call devm_snd_soc_register_card()
Simple-card.c: finish probe
Davinci-mcasp.c: *dma_pcm_platform_register() register PCM  DMA
Davinci-mcasp.c: probe finish

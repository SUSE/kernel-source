Subject: iavf: send VLAN offloading caps once after VFR
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc3
Git-commit: 7dcbdf29282fbcdb646dc785e8a57ed2c2fec8ba
References: git-fixes

When the user disables rxvlan offloading and then changes the number of
channels, all VLAN ports are unable to receive traffic.

Changing the number of channels triggers a VFR reset. During re-init, when
VIRTCHNL_OP_GET_OFFLOAD_VLAN_V2_CAPS is received, we do:
1 - set the IAVF_FLAG_SETUP_NETDEV_FEATURES flag
2 - call
    iavf_set_vlan_offload_features(adapter, 0, netdev->features);

The second step sends to the PF the __default__ features, in this case
aq_required |= IAVF_FLAG_AQ_ENABLE_CTAG_VLAN_STRIPPING

While the first step forces the watchdog task to call
netdev_update_features() ->  iavf_set_features() ->
iavf_set_vlan_offload_features(adapter, netdev->features, features).
Since the user disabled the "rxvlan", this sets:
aq_required |= IAVF_FLAG_AQ_DISABLE_CTAG_VLAN_STRIPPING

When we start processing the AQ commands, both flags are enabled. Since we
process DISABLE_XTAG first then ENABLE_XTAG, this results in the PF
enabling the rxvlan offload. This breaks all communications on the VLAN
net devices.

Fix by removing the call to iavf_set_vlan_offload_features() (second
step). Calling netdev_update_features() from watchdog task is enough for
both init and reset paths.

Subject: [PATCH] cifs: reduce warning log level for server not advertising
 interfaces
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 16a57d7681110b25708c7042688412238e6f73a9
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1

Several users have reported this log getting dumped too regularly to
kernel log. The likely root cause has been identified, and it suggests
that this situation is expected for some configurations
(for example SMB2.1).

Since the function returns appropriately even for such cases, it is
fairly harmless to make this a debug log. When needed, the verbosity
can be increased to capture this log.

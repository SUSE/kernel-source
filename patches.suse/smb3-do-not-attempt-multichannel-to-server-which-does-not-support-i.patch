Subject: [PATCH] smb3: do not attempt multichannel to server which does not
 support it
Git-commit: 9c2dc11df50d1c8537075ff6b98472198e24438e
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsc#1192606

We were ignoring CAP_MULTI_CHANNEL in the server response - if the
server doesn't support multichannel we should not be attempting it.

See MS-SMB2 section 3.2.5.2

Subject: arm64: dts: imx8mn-beacon: Fix RTC capacitive load
Git-commit: c3f03bec30efd5082b55876846d57b5d17dae7b9
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

Although not noticeable when used every day, the RTC appears to drift when
left to sit over time.  This is due to the capacitive load not being
properly set. Fix RTC drift by correcting the capacitive load setting
from 7000 to 12500, which matches the actual hardware configuration.

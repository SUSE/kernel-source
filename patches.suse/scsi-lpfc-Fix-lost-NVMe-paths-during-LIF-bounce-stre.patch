Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix lost NVMe paths during LIF bounce stress test
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
Git-commit: ea92e173dc55460f1b9e71df5ceac951c506d214
References: bsc#1201956

During a target link bounce test, the driver sees a mismatch between the
NPortId and the WWPN on the node structures (ndlps) involved.  When this
occurs, the driver "swaps" the ndlp and new_ndlp node parameters to restore
WWPN/DID uniqueness in the fc_nodes list per vport.  However, the driver
neglected to swap the nlp_fc4_type in the ndlp passed to
lpfc_plogi_confirm_nport causing a failure to recover the NVMe PLOGI/PRLI
and ultimately the NVMe paths.

Correct confirm_nport to preserve the fc4 types from the new-ndlp when the
data is moved over ot the ndlp structure.

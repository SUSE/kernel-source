Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm: fix use-after-free on probe deferral
Git-commit: 6808abdb33bf90330e70a687d29f038507e06ebb
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc3
References: git-fixes

The bridge counter was never reset when tearing down the DRM device so
that stale pointers to deallocated structures would be accessed on the
next tear down (e.g. after a second late bind deferral).

Given enough bridges and a few probe deferrals this could currently also
lead to data beyond the bridge array being corrupted.

Fixes: d28ea556267c ("drm/msm: properly add and remove internal bridges")
Fixes: a3376e3ec81c ("drm/msm: convert to drm_bridge")

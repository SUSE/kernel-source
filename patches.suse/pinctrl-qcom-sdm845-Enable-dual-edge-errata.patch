Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: qcom: sdm845: Enable dual edge errata
Git-commit: 3a3a100473d2f6ebf9bdfe6efedd7e18de724388
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc2
References: git-fixes

It has been observed that dual edge triggered wakeirq GPIOs on SDM845
doesn't trigger interrupts on the falling edge.

Enabling wakeirq_dual_edge_errata for SDM845 indicates that the PDC in
SDM845 suffers from the same problem described, and worked around, by
Doug in 'c3c0c2e18d94 ("pinctrl: qcom: Handle broken/missing PDC dual
edge IRQs on sc7180")', so enable the workaround for SDM845 as well.

The specific problem seen without this is that gpio-keys does not detect
the falling edge of the LID gpio on the Lenovo Yoga C630 and as such
consistently reports the LID as closed.

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "xen-netback: remove 'hotplug-status' once it has
 served its purpose"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This reverts commit 1f2565780e9b7218cf92c7630130e82dcc0fe9c2.

The 'hotplug-status' node should not be removed as long as the vif
device remains configured. Otherwise the xen-netback would wait for
re-running the network script even if it was already called (in case of
the frontent re-connecting). But also, it _should_ be removed when the
vif device is destroyed (for example when unbinding the driver) -
otherwise hotplug script would not configure the device whenever it
re-appear.

Moving removal of the 'hotplug-status' node was a workaround for nothing
calling network script after xen-netback module is reloaded. But when
vif interface is re-created (on xen-netback unbind/bind for example),
the script should be called, regardless of who does that - currently
this case is not handled by the toolstack, and requires manual
script call. Keeping hotplug-status=connected to skip the call is wrong
and leads to not configured interface.

Subject: [PATCH] floppy: fix add_disk() assumption on exit due to new
Git-commit: 2598a2bb357d64baaa94368133ddbc900b9eb246
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1

 developments

After the patch titled "floppy: use blk_mq_alloc_disk and
blk_cleanup_disk" the floppy driver was modified to allocate
the blk_mq_alloc_disk() which allocates the disk with the
queue. This is further clarified later with the patch titled
"block: remove alloc_disk and alloc_disk_node". This clarifies
that:

   Most drivers should use and have been converted to use
   blk_alloc_disk and blk_mq_alloc_disk.  Only the scsi
   ULPs and dasd still allocate a disk separately from the
   request_queue so don't bother with convenience macros for
   something that should not see significant new users and
   remove these wrappers.

And then we have the patch titled, "block: hold a request_queue
reference for the lifetime of struct gendisk" which ensures
that a queue is *always* present for sure during the entire
lifetime of a disk.

In the floppy driver's case then the disk always comes with the
queue. So even if even if the queue was cleaned up on exit, putting
the disk *is* still required, and likewise, blk_cleanup_queue() on
a null queue should not happen now as disk->queue is valid from
disk allocation time on.

Automatic backport code scrapers should hopefully not cherry pick
this patch as a stable fix candidate without full due dilligence to
ensure all the work done on the block layer to make this happen is
merged first.

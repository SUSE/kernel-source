Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries: Fix KVM guest detection for disabling
 hardlockup detector

References: bsc#1194869
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
Git-commit: 44e5d21e6d3fd2a1fed7f0327cf72e99397e2eaf

As per the kernel documentation[1], hardlockup detector should
be disabled in KVM guests as it may give false positives. On
PPC, hardlockup detector is enabled inside KVM guests because
disable_hardlockup_detector() is marked as early_initcall and it
relies on kvm_guest static key (is_kvm_guest()) which is initialized
later during boot by check_kvm_guest(), which is a core_initcall.
check_kvm_guest() is also called in pSeries_smp_probe(), which is called
before initcalls, but it is skipped if KVM guest does not have doorbell
support or if the guest is launched with SMT=1.

Call check_kvm_guest() in disable_hardlockup_detector() so that
is_kvm_guest() check goes through fine and hardlockup detector can be
disabled inside the KVM guest.

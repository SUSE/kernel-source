Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Workarounds for Behringer UMC 204/404 HD
Git-commit: ae8b1631561a3634cc09d0c62bbdd938eade05ec
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc6
References: git-fixes

Both Behringer UMC 202 HD and 404 HD need explicit quirks to enable
the implicit feedback mode and start the playback stream primarily.
The former seems fixing the stuttering and the latter is required for
a playback-only case.

Note that the "clock source 41 is not valid" error message still
appears even after this fix, but it should be only once at probe.
The reason of the error is still unknown, but this seems to be mostly
harmless as it's a one-off error and the driver retires the clock
setup and it succeeds afterwards.

Subject: ARM: dts: sun7i: pcduino3-nano: enable RGMII RX/TX delay on PHY
Git-commit: a7361b9c4615951f52ffd2b1afa09a1384c7b4e4
Patch-mainline: v5.10
References: git-fixes

The RX/TX delays for the Ethernet PHY on the Linksprite pcDuino 3 Nano
are configured in hardware, using resistors that are populated to pull
the RTL8211E's RXDLY/TXDLY pins low or high as needed.

phy-mode should be set to rgmii-id to reflect this. Previously it was
set to rgmii, which used to work but now results in the delays being
disabled again as a result of the bugfix in commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net:
phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx delay config").

Tested on two pcDuino 3 Nano boards purchased in 2015. Without this fix,
Ethernet works unreliably on one board and doesn't work at all on the
other.

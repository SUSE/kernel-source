Subject: [PATCH] staging:iio:adc:ad7280a: Fix handing of device address bit reversing.
Git-commit: f281e4ddbbc0b60f061bc18a2834e9363ba85f9f
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

The bit reversal was wrong for bits 1 and 3 of the 5 bits.
Result is driver failure to probe if you have more than 2 daisy-chained
devices.  Discovered via QEMU based device emulation.

Fixes tag is for when this moved from a macro to a function, but it
was broken before that.

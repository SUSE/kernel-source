Subject: ARM: dts: sunxi: bananapi-m2-plus-v1.2: Fix CPU supply voltages
Git-commit: e4dae01bf08b754de79072441c357737220b873f
Patch-mainline: v5.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

The Bananapi M2+ uses a GPIO line to change the effective resistance of
the CPU supply regulator's feedback resistor network. The voltages
described in the device tree were given directly by the vendor. This
turns out to be slightly off compared to the real values.

The updated voltages are based on calculations of the feedback resistor
network, and verified down to three decimal places with a multi-meter.

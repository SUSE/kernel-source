Subject: [PATCH] SUNRPC: Fix xdr_encode_bool()
Git-commit: c770f31d8f580ed4b965c64f924ec1cc50e41734
Patch-mainline: v6.0
References: git-fixes

I discovered that xdr_encode_bool() was returning the same address
that was passed in the @p parameter. The documenting comment states
that the intent is to return the address of the next buffer
location, just like the other "xdr_encode_*" helpers.

The result was the encoded results of NFSv3 PATHCONF operations were
not formed correctly.

Fixes: ded04a587f6c ("NFSD: Update the NFSv3 PATHCONF3res encoder to use struct xdr_stream")

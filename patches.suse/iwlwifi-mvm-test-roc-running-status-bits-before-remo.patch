Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: mvm: test roc running status bits before removing the sta
Git-commit: 998e1aba6e5eb35370eaf30ccc1823426ec11f90
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

In some cases the sta is being removed twice since we do not test the
roc aux running before removing it. Start looking at the bit before
removing the sta.

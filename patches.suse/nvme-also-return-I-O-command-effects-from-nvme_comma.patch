Subject: nvme: also return I/O command effects from nvme_command_effects
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc2
Git-commit: 831ed60c2aca2d7c517b2da22897a90224a97d27
References: git-fixes

To be able to use the Commands Supported and Effects Log for allowing
unprivileged passtrough, it needs to be corretly reported for I/O
commands as well.  Return the I/O command effects from
nvme_command_effects, and also add a default list of effects for the
NVM command set.  For other command sets, the Commands Supported and
Effects log is required to be present already.

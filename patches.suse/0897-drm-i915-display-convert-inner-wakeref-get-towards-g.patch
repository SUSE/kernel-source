This patch brings no functional change. Since at this point of
the code we are already asserting a wakeref was held, it means
that we are with runtime_pm 'in_use' and in practical terms we
are only bumping the pm_runtime usage counter and moving on.

However, xe driver has a lockdep annotation that warned us that
if a sync resume was actually called at this point, we could have
a deadlock because we are inside the power_domains->lock locked
area and the resume would call the irq_reset, which would also
try to get the power_domains->lock.

For this reason, let's convert this call to a safer option and
calm lockdep on.

v2: use _noresume variant instead of get_in_use (Ville, Imre)

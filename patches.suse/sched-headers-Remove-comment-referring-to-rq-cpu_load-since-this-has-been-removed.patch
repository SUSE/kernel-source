Subject: [PATCH] sched/headers: Remove comment referring to rq::cpu_load,
 since this has been removed

References: bsc#1212887 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: b19fdb16fb2167c6bc9ee8fbc0c1d2d4fd3e2eb8
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git

There is a comment that refers to cpu_load, however, this cpu_load was
removed with:

  55627e3cd22c ("sched/core: Remove rq->cpu_load[]")

... back in 2019. The comment does not make sense with respect to this
removed array, so remove the comment.

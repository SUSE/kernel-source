Subject: drm/vmwgfx: Disable coherent dumb buffers without 3d
Git-commit: e9fd436bb8fb9b9d31fdf07bbcdba6d30290c5e4
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc6
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022 CVE-2024-46712 bsc#1230543

Coherent surfaces make only sense if the host renders to them using
accelerated apis. Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers stays
in the guest making all of the extra work they're doing to synchronize
between guest and host useless.

Configurations without 3d also tend to run with very low graphics
memory limits. The pinned console fb, mob cursors and graphical login
manager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests use.

Fix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used on
configs with 3d enabled.

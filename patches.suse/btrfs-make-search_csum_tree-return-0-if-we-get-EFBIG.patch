Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: make search_csum_tree return 0 if we get -EFBIG
Git-commit: 03ddb19d2ea745228879b9334f3b550c88acb10a
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

We can either fail to find a csum entry at all and return -ENOENT, or we
can find a range that is close, but return -EFBIG.  In essence these
both mean the same thing when we are doing a lookup for a csum in an
existing range, we didn't find a csum.  We want to treat both of these
errors the same way, complain loudly that there wasn't a csum.  This
currently happens anyway because we do

	count = search_csum_tree();
	if (count <= 0) {
		// reloc and error handling
	}

However it forces us to incorrectly treat EIO or ENOMEM errors as on
disk corruption.  Fix this by returning 0 if we get either -ENOENT or
-EFBIG from btrfs_lookup_csum() so we can do proper error handling.

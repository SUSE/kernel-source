Subject: [PATCH] clk: sunxi-ng: v3s: Fix de clock definition
Git-commit: e8ab346f9907a1a3aa2f0e5decf849925c06ae2e
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

The de clock is marked with CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT, which is really not
necessary (as confirmed from experimentation) and significantly
restricts flexibility for other clocks using the same parent.

In addition the source selection (parent) field is marked as using
2 bits, when it the documentation reports that it uses 3.

Fix both issues in the de clock definition.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Limit max buffer and period sizes per time
Git-commit: 24d0c9f0e7de95fe3e3e0067cbea1cd5d413244b
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc3
References: git-fixes

In the previous fix, we increased the max buffer bytes from 1MB to 4MB
so that we can use bigger buffers for the modern HiFi devices with
higher rates, more channels and wider formats.  OTOH, extending this
has a concern that too big buffer is allowed for the lower rates, less
channels and narrower formats; when an application tries to allocate
as big buffer as possible, it'll lead to unexpectedly too huge size.

Also, we had a problem about the inconsistent max buffer and period
bytes for the implicit feedback mode when both streams have different
channels.  This was fixed by the (relatively complex) patch to reduce
the max buffer and period bytes accordingly.

This is an alternative fix for those, a patch to kill two birds with
one stone (*): instead of increasing the max buffer bytes blindly and
applying the reduction per channels, we simply use the hw constraints
for the buffer and period "time".  Meanwhile the max buffer and period
bytes are set unlimited instead.

Since the inconsistency of buffer (and period) bytes comes from the
difference of the channels in the tied streams, as long as we care
only about the buffer (and period) time, it doesn't matter; the buffer
time is same for different channels, although we still allow higher
buffer size.  Similarly, this will allow more buffer bytes for HiFi
devices while it also keeps the reasonable size for the legacy
devices, too.

As of this patch, the max period and buffer time are set to 1 and 2
seconds, which should be large enough for all possible use cases.

(*) No animals were harmed in the making of this patch.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: correct wifi interrupt flag in Box Demo
Git-commit: 2d6f7e3938a7aba154c8e8afaddc8b7f1e0a1b56
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc7
References: git-fixes

GPIO_ACTIVE_x flags are not correct in the context of interrupt flags.
These are simple defines so they could be used in DTS but they will not
have the same meaning: GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH = 0 = IRQ_TYPE_NONE.

Correct the interrupt flags, assuming the author of the code wanted same
logical behavior behind the name "ACTIVE_xxx", this is:
  ACTIVE_HIGH  => IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH

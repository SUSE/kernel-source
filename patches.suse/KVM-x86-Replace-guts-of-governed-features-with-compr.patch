Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Replace guts of "governed" features with
 comprehensive cpu_caps

Replace the internals of the governed features framework with a more
comprehensive "guest CPU capabilities" implementation, i.e. with a guest
version of kvm_cpu_caps.  Keep the skeleton of governed features around
for now as vmx_adjust_sec_exec_control() relies on detecting governed
features to do the right thing for XSAVES, and switching all guest feature
queries to guest_cpu_cap_has() requires subtle and non-trivial changes,
i.e. is best done as a standalone change.

Tracking *all* guest capabilities that KVM cares will allow excising the
poorly named "governed features" framework, and effectively optimizes all
KVM queries of guest capabilities, i.e. doesn't require making a
subjective decision as to whether or not a feature is worth "governing",
and doesn't require adding the code to do so.

The cost of tracking all features is currently 92 bytes per vCPU on 64-bit
kernels: 100 bytes for cpu_caps versus 8 bytes for governed_features.
That cost is well worth paying even if the only benefit was eliminating
the "governed features" terminology.  And practically speaking, the real
cost is zero unless those 92 bytes pushes the size of vcpu_vmx or vcpu_svm
into a new order-N allocation, and if that happens there are better ways
to reduce the footprint of kvm_vcpu_arch, e.g. making the PMU and/or MTRR
state separate allocations.

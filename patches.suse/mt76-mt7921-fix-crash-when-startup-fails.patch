Subject: [PATCH] mt76: mt7921: fix crash when startup fails.
Git-commit: 827e7799c61b978fbc2cc9dac66cb62401b2b3f0
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

If the nic fails to start, it is possible that the
reset_work has already been scheduled.  Ensure the
work item is canceled so we do not have use-after-free
crash in case cleanup is called before the work item
is executed.

This fixes crash on my x86_64 apu2 when mt7921k radio
fails to work.  Radio still fails, but OS does not
crash.

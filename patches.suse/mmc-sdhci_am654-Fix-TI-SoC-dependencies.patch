Git-commit: cb052da7f031b0d2309a4895ca236afb3b4bbf50
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

The sdhci_am654 is specific to recent TI SoCs, update the
dependencies for those SoCs and compile testing. While we're
at it update the text to reflect the wider range of
supported TI SoCS the driver now supports.

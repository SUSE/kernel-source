Subject: ice: fix devlink reload call trace
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc7
Git-commit: d3f867e7a04678640ebcbfb81893c59f4af48586
References: CVE-2026-23104 bsc#1257763

Commit 4da71a77fc3b ("ice: read internal temperature sensor") introduced
internal temperature sensor reading via HWMON. ice_hwmon_init() was added
to ice_init_feature() and ice_hwmon_exit() was added to ice_remove(). As a
result if devlink reload is used to reinit the device and then the driver
is removed, a call trace can occur.

BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc0fd4b5d
Call Trace:
 string+0x48/0xe0
 vsnprintf+0x1f9/0x650
 sprintf+0x62/0x80
 name_show+0x1f/0x30
 dev_attr_show+0x19/0x60

The call trace repeats approximately every 10 minutes when system
monitoring tools (e.g., sadc) attempt to read the orphaned hwmon sysfs
attributes that reference freed module memory.

The sequence is:
1. Driver load, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from ice_init_feature()
2. Devlink reload down, flow does not call ice_remove()
3. Devlink reload up, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from
   ice_init_feature() resulting in a second instance
4. Driver unload, ice_hwmon_exit() called from ice_remove() leaving the
   first hwmon instance orphaned with dangling pointer

Fix this by moving ice_hwmon_exit() from ice_remove() to
ice_deinit_features() to ensure proper cleanup symmetry with
ice_hwmon_init().

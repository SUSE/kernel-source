Subject: i2c: cadence: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails
Git-commit: 23ceb8462dc6f4b4decdb5536a7e5fc477cdf0b6
Patch-mainline: v5.13
References: bsc#1220570 CVE-2020-36784

The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on
return in functions cdns_i2c_master_xfer and cdns_reg_slave.

However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter
even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a
reference leak here.

Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
counter balanced.

[JD: backporting notes:
 Only fix cdns_i2c_master_xfer as cdns_reg_slave did not exist
 in this version of the kernel.]

Subject: x86/perf: Default set FREEZE_ON_SMI for all
Git-commit: a01994f5e5c79d3a35e5e8cf4252c7f2147323c3
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc3
References: git fixes

Kyle reported that rr[0] has started to malfunction on Comet Lake and
later CPUs due to EFI starting to make use of CPL3 [1] and the PMU
event filtering not distinguishing between regular CPL3 and SMM CPL3.

Since this is a privilege violation, default disable SMM visibility
where possible.

Administrators wanting to observe SMM cycles can easily change this
using the sysfs attribute while regular users don't have access to
this file.

end of page 5.

Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/traps: do not enable irqs in _exception
Git-commit: d0afd44c05f8f4e4c91487c02d43c87a31552462
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc5
References: stable-5.14.12

[ Upstream commit d0afd44c05f8f4e4c91487c02d43c87a31552462 ]

_exception can be called by machine check handlers when the MCE hits
user code (e.g., pseries and powernv). This will enable local irqs
because, which is a dicey thing to do in NMI or hard irq context.

This seemed to worked out okay because a userspace MCE can basically be
treated like a synchronous interrupt (after async / imprecise MCEs are
filtered out). Since NMI and hard irq handlers have started growing
nmi_enter / irq_enter, and more irq state sanity checks, this has
started to cause problems (or at least trigger warnings).

The Fixes tag to the commit which introduced this rather than try to
work out exactly which commit was the first that could possibly cause a
problem because that may be difficult to prove.

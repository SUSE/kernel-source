Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries: fix accuracy of stolen time

References: bsc#1215199 bsc#1220129 ltc#205683
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc5
Git-commit: cbecc9fcbbec60136b0180ba0609c829afed5c81

powerVM hypervisor updates the VPA fields with stolen time data.
It currently reports enqueue_dispatch_tb and ready_enqueue_tb for
this purpose. In linux these two fields are used to report the stolen time.

The VPA fields are updated at the TB frequency. On powerPC its mostly
set at 512Mhz. Hence this needs a conversion to ns when reporting it
back as rest of the kernel timings are in ns. This conversion is already
handled in tb_to_ns function. So use that function to report accurate
stolen time.

Observed this issue and used an Capped Shared Processor LPAR(SPLPAR) to
simplify the experiments. In all these cases, 100% VP Load is run using
stress-ng workload. Values of stolen time is in percentages as reported
by mpstat. With the patch values are close to expected.

		6.8.rc1		+Patch
12EC/12VP	   0.0		   0.0
12EC/24VP	  25.7		  50.2
12EC/36VP	  37.3		  69.2
12EC/48VP	  38.5		  78.3

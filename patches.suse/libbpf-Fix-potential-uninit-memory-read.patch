Subject: libbpf: Fix potential uninit memory read
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: 4581e676d3be9d8c921a48bf18e92c5a8f31bf13
References: jsc#PED-1368

In case of BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL we fill out target result explicitly.
But targ_res itself isn't initialized in such a case, and subsequent
call to bpf_core_patch_insn() might read uninitialized field (like
fail_memsz_adjust in this case). So ensure that targ_res is
zero-initialized for BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL case.

This was reported by Coverity static analyzer.

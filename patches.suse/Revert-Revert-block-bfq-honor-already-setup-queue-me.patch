Subject: [PATCH] Revert "Revert "block, bfq: honor already-setup queue
 merges""
Git-commit: 15729ff8143f8135b03988a100a19e66d7cb7ecd
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1183

A crash [1] happened to be triggered in conjunction with commit
2d52c58b9c9b ("block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges"). The
latter was then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17 ("Revert "block, bfq:
honor already-setup queue merges""). Yet, the reverted commit was not
the one introducing the bug. In fact, it actually triggered a UAF
introduced by a different commit, and now fixed by commit d29bd41428cf
("block, bfq: reset last_bfqq_created on group change").

So, there is no point in keeping commit 2d52c58b9c9b ("block, bfq:
honor already-setup queue merges") out. This commit restores it.

Subject: ARM: dts: suniv: F1C100: fix watchdog compatible
Git-commit: 01a850ee61cbf0ab77dcbf26bb133fec2dd640d6
Patch-mainline: v5.18 or v5.18-rc8 (next release)
References: git-fixes

The F1C100 series of SoCs actually have their watchdog IP being
compatible with the newer Allwinner generation, not the older one.

The currently described sun4i-a10-wdt actually does not work, neither
the watchdog functionality (just never fires), nor the reset part
(reboot hangs).

Replace the compatible string with the one used by the newer generation.
Verified to work with both the watchdog and reboot functionality on a
LicheePi Nano.

Also add the missing interrupt line and clock source, to make it binding
compliant.

Subject: x86/cpu: Detect TDX partial write machine check erratum
Git-commit: 1e536e10689700e006989dea33918cce348e04b6
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: jsc#PED-5824

TDX memory has integrity and confidentiality protections.  Violations of
this integrity protection are supposed to only affect TDX operations and
are never supposed to affect the host kernel itself.  In other words,
the host kernel should never, itself, see machine checks induced by the
TDX integrity hardware.

Alas, the first few generations of TDX hardware have an erratum.  A
partial write to a TDX private memory cacheline will silently "poison"
the line.  Subsequent reads will consume the poison and generate a
machine check.  According to the TDX hardware spec, neither of these
things should have happened.

Virtually all kernel memory accesses operations happen in full
cachelines.  In practice, writing a "byte" of memory usually reads a 64
byte cacheline of memory, modifies it, then writes the whole line back.
Those operations do not trigger this problem.

This problem is triggered by "partial" writes where a write transaction
of less than cacheline lands at the memory controller.  The CPU does
these via non-temporal write instructions (like MOVNTI), or through
UC/WC memory mappings.  The issue can also be triggered away from the
CPU by devices doing partial writes via DMA.

With this erratum, there are additional things need to be done.  To
prepare for those changes, add a CPU bug bit to indicate this erratum.
Note this bug reflects the hardware thus it is detected regardless of
whether the kernel is built with TDX support or not.

Subject: ARM: dts: s5pv210: Set keep-power-in-suspend for SDHCI1 on Aries
Git-commit: 869d42e6eba821905e1a0950623aadafe1a6e6d3
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

SDHCI1 is connected to a BCM4329 WiFi/BT chip which requires
power to be kept over suspend.  As the surrounding hardware supports
this, mark it as such.  This fixes WiFi after a suspend/resume cycle.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix headset mic for Acer SF313-51
Git-commit: 5f3fe25e70559fa3b096ab17e13316c93ddb7020
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7
References: git-fixes

The issue on Acer SWIFT SF313-51 is that headset microphone
doesn't work. The following quirk fixed headset microphone issue.
Note that the fixup of SF314-54/55 (ALC256_FIXUP_ACER_HEADSET_MIC)
was not successful on my SF313-51.

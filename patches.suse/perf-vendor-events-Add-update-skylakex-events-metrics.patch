Subject: perf vendor events: Add/update skylakex events/metrics
Git-commit: 4c10b96f490efc6926b915a9611c5e1b28ac99ea
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: perf-sp7-v6.11-userspace-update

Update events from v1.33 to v1.35.
Update TMA metrics from v4.7 to v4.8.

Bring in the event updates v1.35:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/c99b60c147b96f40f96dd961abfae54909f47e5f

The TMA 4.8 information was added in:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/59194d4d90ca50a3fcb2de0d82b9f6fc0c9a5736

Add counter information. The most recent RFC patch set using this
information:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240412210756.309828-1-weilin.wang@intel.com/

Adds the event SW_PREFETCH_ACCESS.ANY.

Assists are long sequences of uops that are required in certain corner-cases for operations that cannot be handled natively by the execution pipeline. For example; when working with very small floating point values (so-called Denormals); the FP units are not set up to perform these operations natively. Instead; a sequence of instructions to perform the computation on the Denormals is injected into the pipeline. Since these microcode sequences might be dozens of uops long; Assists can be extremely deleterious to performance and they can be avoided in many cases. Sample with: OTHER_ASSISTS.ANY",

         "PublicDescription": "Number of times a VN0 credit was used on the DRS message channel.  In order for a request to be transferred across UPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was used.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN0 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.; Data Response (WB) messages on BL.  WB is generally used to transmit data with coherency.

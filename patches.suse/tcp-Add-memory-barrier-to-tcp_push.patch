Subject: tcp: Add memory barrier to tcp_push()
Git-commit: 7267e8dcad6b2f9fce05a6a06335d7040acbc2b6
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc2

On CPUs with weak memory models, reads and updates performed by tcp_push
to the sk variables can get reordered leaving the socket throttled when
it should not. The tasklet running tcp_wfree() may also not observe the
memory updates in time and will skip flushing any packets throttled by
tcp_push(), delaying the sending. This can pathologically cause 40ms
extra latency due to bad interactions with delayed acks.

Adding a memory barrier in tcp_push removes the bug, similarly to the
previous commit bf06200e732d ("tcp: tsq: fix nonagle handling").
smp_mb__after_atomic() is used to not incur in unnecessary overhead
on x86 since not affected.

Patch has been tested using an AWS c7g.2xlarge instance with Ubuntu
22.04 and Apache Tomcat 9.0.83 running the basic servlet below:

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/html;charset=utf-8");
        OutputStreamWriter osw = new OutputStreamWriter(response.getOutputStream(),"UTF-8");
        String s = "a".repeat(3096);
        osw.write(s,0,s.length());
        osw.flush();
    }
}

Load was applied using wrk2 (https://github.com/kinvolk/wrk2) from an AWS
c6i.8xlarge instance. Before the patch an additional 40ms latency from P99.99+
values is observed while, with the patch, the extra latency disappears.

 99.999%    2.53ms
100.000%    2.62ms

Patch has been also tested on x86 (m7i.2xlarge instance) which it is not
affected by this issue and the patch doesn't introduce any additional
delay.

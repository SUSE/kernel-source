Subject: ACPI: PM: Add acpi_device_fix_up_power_children() function
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc3
Git-commit: 37ba91a82e3b9de35f64348c62b5ec7d74e3a41c
References: jsc#PED-6747

In some cases it is necessary to fix-up the power-state of an ACPI
device's children without touching the ACPI device itself add
a new acpi_device_fix_up_power_children() function for this.

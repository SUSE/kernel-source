Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dpu: Disallow unallocated resources to be returned
Git-commit: abc40122d9a69f56c04efb5a7485795f5ac799d1
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

In the event that the topology requests resources that have not been
created by the system (because they are typically not represented in
dpu_mdss_cfg ^1), the resource(s) in global_state (in this case DSC
blocks, until their allocation/assignment is being sanity-checked in
"drm/msm/dpu: Reject topologies for which no DSC blocks are available")
remain NULL but will still be returned out of
dpu_rm_get_assigned_resources, where the caller expects to get an array
containing num_blks valid pointers (but instead gets these NULLs).

To prevent this from happening, where null-pointer dereferences
typically result in a hard-to-debug platform lockup, num_blks shouldn't
increase past NULL blocks and will print an error and break instead.
After all, max_blks represents the static size of the maximum number of
blocks whereas the actual amount varies per platform.

^1: which can happen after a git rebase ended up moving additions to
_dpu_cfg to a different struct which has the same patch context.

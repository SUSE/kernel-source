Subject: arm64: cputype: Remove duplicate Cortex-X1C definitions
Git-commit: 52b49bd6de29a89a040fa33e980270904c734d69
Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13757

We currently have duplicate definitions for ARM_CPU_PART_CORTEX_X1C and
MIDR_CORTEX_X1C as a result of commits:

  58d245e03c324d08 ("arm64: cputype: Add Cortex-X1C definitions")
  efe676a1a7554219 ("arm64: proton-pack: Add new CPUs 'k' values for branch mitigation")

Due to inconsistent sorting when adding entries, there was no textual
conflict between the two patches.

Delete the duplicate definitions added by the latter commit.

The definitions in general are largely (but not entirely) in order of
the MIDR_EL1.PartNum value rather than by CPU name, and the remaining
Cortex-X1C definitions appear later in the list.

For now I haven't sorted the remaining MIDR definitions to minimize
churn. I intend to perform some larger cleanup of these in the near
future which should supersede that anyhow.

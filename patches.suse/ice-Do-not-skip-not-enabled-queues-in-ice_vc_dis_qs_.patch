Subject: [PATCH 08/12] ice: Do not skip not enabled queues in
 ice_vc_dis_qs_msg
Git-commit: 05ef6813b234db3196f083b91db3963f040b65bb
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc2
References: git-fixes

Disable check for queue being enabled in ice_vc_dis_qs_msg, because
there could be a case when queues were created, but were not enabled.
We still need to delete those queues.

Normal workflow for VF looks like:
Enable path:
VIRTCHNL_OP_ADD_ETH_ADDR (opcode 10)
VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES (opcode 6)
VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES (opcode 8)

Disable path:
VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES (opcode 9)
VIRTCHNL_OP_DEL_ETH_ADDR (opcode 11)

The issue appears only in stress conditions when VF is enabled and
disabled very fast.
Eventually there will be a case, when queues are created by
VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES, but are not enabled by
VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES.
In turn, these queues are not deleted by VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES,
because there is a check whether queues are enabled in
ice_vc_dis_qs_msg.

When we bring up the VF again, we will see the "Failed to set LAN Tx queue
context" error during VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES step. This
happens because old 16 queues were not deleted and VF requests to create
16 more, but ice_sched_get_free_qparent in ice_ena_vsi_txq would fail to
find a parent node for first newly requested queue (because all nodes
are allocated to 16 old queues).

Testing Hints:

Just enable and disable VF fast enough, so it would be disabled before
reaching VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES.

while true; do
        ip link set dev ens785f0v0 up
        sleep 0.065 # adjust delay value for you machine
        ip link set dev ens785f0v0 down
done

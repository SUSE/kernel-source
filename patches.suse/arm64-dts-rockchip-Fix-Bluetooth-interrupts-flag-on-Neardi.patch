Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix Bluetooth interrupts flag on Neardi LBA3368
Git-commit: c9f986a54d4031a9b9dff1eb616b0796aa28c730
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc5
References: git-fixes

GPIO_ACTIVE_x flags are not correct in the context of interrupt flags.
These are simple defines so they could be used in DTS but they will not
have the same meaning: GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH = 0 = IRQ_TYPE_NONE.

Correct the interrupt flags, assuming the author of the code wanted same
logical behavior behind the name "ACTIVE_xxx", this is:
  ACTIVE_HIGH  => IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH

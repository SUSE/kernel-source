Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/vmx: Do not skip segment attributes if unusable bit
 is set

When serializing and deserializing kvm_sregs, attributes of the segment
descriptors are stored by user space. For unusable segments,
vmx_segment_access_rights skips all attributes and sets them to 0.

This means we zero out the DPL (Descriptor Privilege Level) for unusable
entries.

Unusable segments are - contrary to their name - usable in 64bit mode and
are used by guests to for example create a linear map through the
NULL selector.

VMENTER checks if SS.DPL is correct depending on the CS segment type.
For types 9 (Execute Only) and 11 (Execute Read), CS.DPL must be equal to
SS.DPL [1].

We have seen real world guests setting CS to a usable segment with DPL=3
and SS to an unusable segment with DPL=3. Once we go through an sregs
get/set cycle, SS.DPL turns to 0. This causes the virtual machine to crash
reproducibly.

This commit changes the attribute logic to always preserve attributes for
unusable segments. According to [2] SS.DPL is always saved on VM exits,
regardless of the unusable bit so user space applications should have saved
the information on serialization correctly.

[3] specifies that besides SS.DPL the rest of the attributes of the
descriptors are undefined after VM entry if unusable bit is set. So, there
should be no harm in setting them all to the previous state.

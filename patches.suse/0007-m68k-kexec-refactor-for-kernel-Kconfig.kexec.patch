Subject: [PATCH 07/15] m68k/kexec: refactor for kernel/Kconfig.kexec
Git-commit: a7cc67de6a9a01f5be97c229f0bd4768db1a5abd
References: jsc#PED-5077
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1

The kexec and crash kernel options are provided in the common
kernel/Kconfig.kexec. Utilize the common options and provide
the ARCH_SUPPORTS_ and ARCH_SELECTS_ entries to recreate the
equivalent set of KEXEC and CRASH options.

-	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
-	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
-	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
-	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.
-
-	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.
-
-	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
-	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
-	  initially work for you.  As of this writing the exact hardware
-	  interface is strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be
-	  made.

Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: intel: improve suspend flows
Git-commit: 8ddeafb957a9a6dd33b2c80309d726d3141df08f
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: jsc#PED-850

This patch provides both a simplification of the suspend flows and a
better balanced operation during suspend/resume transition, as part of
the transition of Sound Open Firmware (SOF) to dynamic pipelines: the
DSP resources are only enabled when required instead of enabled on
startup.

The exiting code relies on a convoluted way of dealing with suspend
signals. Since there is no .suspend DAI callback, we used the
component .suspend and marked all the component DAI dmas as
'suspended'. The information was used in the .prepare stage to
differentiate resume operations from xrun handling, and only
reinitialize SHIM registers and DMA in the former case.

While this solution has been working reliably for about 2 years, there
is a much better solution consisting in trapping the TRIGGER_SUSPEND
in the .trigger DAI ops. The DMA is still marked in the same way for
the .prepare op to run, but in addition the callbacks sent to DSP
firmware are now balanced.

Normal operation:
hw_params -> intel_params_stream
hw_free   -> intel_free_stream

suspend    -> intel_free_stream
prepare    -> intel_params_stream

This balanced operation was not required with existing SOF firmware
relying on static pipelines instantiated at every boot. With the
on-going transition to dynamic pipelines, it's however a requirement
to keep the use count for the DAI widget balanced across all
transitions.

The component suspend is not removed but instead modified to deal with
a corner case: when a substream is PAUSED, the ALSA core does not
throw the TRIGGER_SUSPEND. This is problematic since the refcount for
all pipelines and widgets is not balanced, leading to issues on
resume. The trigger callback keeps track of the 'paused' state with a
new flag, which is tested during the component suspend called later to
release the remaining DSP resources. These resources will be
re-enabled in the .prepare step.

The IPC used in the TRIGGER_SUSPEND to release DSP resources is not a
problem since the BE dailink is already marked as non-atomic.

Subject: [PATCH] serial: core: Fix the definition name in the comment of UPF_* flags
Git-commit: 916acbf6b4b9262df7de1d2b6208a4efa209a88f
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

From day 1 the UPF_LAST_USER wasn't defined, a specific number of
the last bit for userspace. Instead the code always relies on
ASYNCB_LAST_USER. Fix comment accordingly.

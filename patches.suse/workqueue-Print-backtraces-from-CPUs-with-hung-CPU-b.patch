Subject: [PATCH] workqueue: Print backtraces from CPUs with hung CPU bound
 workqueues
Git-commit: cd2440d66fec7d1bdb4f605b64c27c63c9141989
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: bsc#1211044

The workqueue watchdog reports a lockup when there was not any progress
in the worker pool for a long time. The progress means that a pending
work item starts being proceed.

Worker pools for unbound workqueues always wake up an idle worker and
try to process the work immediately. The last idle worker has to create
new worker first. The stall might happen only when a new worker could
not be created in which case an error should get printed. Another problem
might be too high load. In this case, workers are victims of a global
system problem.

Worker pools for CPU bound workqueues are designed for lightweight
work items that do not need much CPU time. They are proceed one by
one on a single worker. New worker is used only when a work is sleeping.
It creates one additional scenario. The stall might happen when
the CPU-bound workqueue is used for CPU-intensive work.

More precisely, the stall is detected when a CPU-bound worker is in
the TASK_RUNNING state for too long. In this case, it might be useful
to see the backtrace from the problematic worker.

The information how long a worker is in the running state is not available.
But the CPU-bound worker pools do not have many workers in the running
state by definition. And only few pools are typically blocked.

It should be acceptable to print backtraces from all workers in
TASK_RUNNING state in the stalled worker pools. The number of false
positives should be very low.

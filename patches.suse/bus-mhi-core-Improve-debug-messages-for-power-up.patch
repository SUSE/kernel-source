Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: core: Improve debug messages for power up
Git-commit: 61106bd2a8e4f02dacfbdf147c641b378a4c3de5
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1206451

Improve error message to be more descriptive if a failure occurs
with an invalid power up execution environment. Additionally, add
a debug log to print the execution environment and MHI state
before a power up is attempted to confirm if the device is in an
expected state. This helps clarify reasons for power up failures
such as the device being found in a PBL or Emergency Download
Mode execution environment and the host expected a full power up
with Pass-Through and no image loading involved.

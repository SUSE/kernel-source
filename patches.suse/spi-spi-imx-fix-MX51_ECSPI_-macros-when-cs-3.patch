Subject: [PATCH] spi: spi-imx: fix MX51_ECSPI_* macros when cs > 3
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 87c614175bbf28d3fd076dc2d166bac759e41427
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

When using gpio based chip select the cs value can go outside the range
0 â€“ 3. The various MX51_ECSPI_* macros did not take this into consideration
resulting in possible corruption of the configuration.

For example for any cs value over 3 the SCLKPHA bits would not be set and
other values in the register possibly corrupted.

One way to fix this is to just mask the cs bits to 2 bits. This still
allows all 4 native chip selects to work as well as gpio chip selects
(which can use any of the 4 chip select configurations).

Subject: selftests/bpf: Remove flaky test_btf_id test
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
Git-commit: 56925f389e152dcb8d093435d43b78a310539c23
References: bsc#1220247
X-Info: not a fix, pulled to better align with upstream

With previous patch, one of subtests in test_btf_id becomes
flaky and may fail. The following is a failing example:

  Error: #26 btf
  Error: #26/174 btf/BTF ID
    Error: #26/174 btf/BTF ID
    btf_raw_create:PASS:check 0 nsec
    btf_raw_create:PASS:check 0 nsec
    test_btf_id:PASS:check 0 nsec
    ...
    test_btf_id:PASS:check 0 nsec
    test_btf_id:FAIL:check BTF lingersdo_test_get_info:FAIL:check failed: -1

The test tries to prove a btf_id not available after the map is closed.
But btf_id is freed only after workqueue and a rcu grace period, compared
to previous case just after a rcu grade period.
Depending on system workload, workqueue could take quite some time
to execute function bpf_map_free_deferred() which may cause the test failure.
Instead of adding arbitrary delays, let us remove the logic to
check btf_id availability after map is closed.

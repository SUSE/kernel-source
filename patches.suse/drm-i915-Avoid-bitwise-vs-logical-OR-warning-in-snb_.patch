Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning in snb_wm_latency_quirk()

A new warning in clang points out a place in this file where a bitwise
OR is being used with boolean types:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:3066:12: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
        changed = ilk_increase_wm_latency(dev_priv, dev_priv->wm.pri_latency, 12) |
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This construct is intentional, as it allows every one of the calls to
ilk_increase_wm_latency() to occur (instead of short circuiting with
logical OR) while still caring about the result of each call.

To make this clearer to the compiler, use the '|=' operator to assign
the result of each ilk_increase_wm_latency() call to changed, which
keeps the meaning of the code the same but makes it obvious that every
one of these calls is expected to happen.

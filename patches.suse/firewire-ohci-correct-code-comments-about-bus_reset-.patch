Subject: [PATCH] firewire: ohci: correct code comments about bus_reset tasklet
Git-commit: 088eb0f161c58969bc7544e5d6c1451ed18d2ddb
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

The tasklet for bus reset event has been replaced with work item, while
some code comments still address to the tasklet.

This commit corrects them.

Fixes: 2d7a36e23300 ("firewire: ohci: Move code from the bus reset tasklet into a workqueue")

Subject: [PATCH] ABI: sysfs-devices-removable: make a table valid as ReST markup
Git-commit: 1f223cdb38a73616eea9eeebd835d3381014ad86
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

Changeset 70f400d4d957 ("driver core: Move the "removable" attribute from USB to core")
added a table to the file, but not using a valid ReST format.

Change it to avoid build issues when producing documentation with
"make htmldocs".

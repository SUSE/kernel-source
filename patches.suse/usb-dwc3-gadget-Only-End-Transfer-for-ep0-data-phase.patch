Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Only End Transfer for ep0 data phase
Git-commit: ace17b6ee4f92ab0375d12a1b42494f8590a96b6
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1

The driver shouldn't be able to issue End Transfer to the control
endpoint at anytime. Typically we should only do so in error cases such
as invalid/unexpected direction of Data Phase as described in the
control transfer flow of the programming guide. It _may_ end started
data phase during controller deinitialization from soft disconnect or
driver removal. However, that should not happen because the driver
should be maintained in EP0_SETUP_PHASE during driver tear-down. On
soft-connect, the controller should be reset from a soft-reset and there
should be no issue starting the control endpoint.

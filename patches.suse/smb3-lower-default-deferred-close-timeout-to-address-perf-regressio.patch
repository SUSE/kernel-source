Subject: [PATCH] smb3: lower default deferred close timeout to address perf
 regression
Git-commit: 7e0e76d99079be13c9961dde7c93b2d1ee665af4
References: bsc#1193629
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc4

Performance tests with large number of threads noted that the change
of the default closetimeo (deferred close timeout between when
close is done by application and when client has to send the close
to the server), to 5 seconds from 1 second, significantly degraded
perf in some cases like this (in the filebench example reported,
the stats show close requests on the wire taking twice as long,
and 50% regression in filebench perf). This is stil configurable
via mount parm closetimeo, but to be safe, decrease default back
to its previous value of 1 second.

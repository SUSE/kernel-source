Subject: [PATCH] kABI placeholders for coco host support
Patch-mainline: Never, kABI padding
References: jsc#PED-6143

Add kABI placeholders for confidential computing host support (SEV-SNP,
TDX).

Use the names and positions as in the not yet upstream patches in
order to make backporting of patches easier once they are upstream.

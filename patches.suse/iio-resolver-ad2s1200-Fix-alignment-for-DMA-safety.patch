Subject: [PATCH] iio: resolver: ad2s1200: Fix alignment for DMA safety

Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

____cacheline_aligned is an insufficient guarantee for non-coherent DMA
on platforms with 128 byte cachelines above L1.  Switch to the updated
IIO_DMA_MINALIGN definition.

Fixes tag is probably not where the issue was first introduced, but
is likely to be as far as anyone considers backporting this fix.

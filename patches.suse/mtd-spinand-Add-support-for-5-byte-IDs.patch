Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spinand: Add support for 5-byte IDs
Git-commit: 34a956739d295de6010cdaafeed698ccbba87ea4
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: stable-fixes

E.g. ESMT chips will return an identification code with a length of 5
bytes. In order to prevent ambiguity, flash chips would actually need to
return IDs that are up to 17 or more bytes long due to JEDEC's
continuation scheme. I understand that if a manufacturer ID is located
in bank N of JEDEC's database (there are currently 16 banks), N - 1
continuation codes (7Fh) need to be added to the identification code
(comprising of manufacturer ID and device ID). However, most flash chip
manufacturers don't seem to implement this (correctly).

Subject: ring-buffer: Fix race between reset page and reading page
Git-commit: a0fcaaed0c46cf9399d3a2d6e0c87ddb3df0e044
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

The ring buffer is broken up into sub buffers (currently of page size).
Each sub buffer has a pointer to its "tail" (the last event written to the
sub buffer). When a new event is requested, the tail is locally
incremented to cover the size of the new event. This is done in a way that
there is no need for locking.

If the tail goes past the end of the sub buffer, the process of moving to
the next sub buffer takes place. After setting the current sub buffer to
the next one, the previous one that had the tail go passed the end of the
sub buffer needs to be reset back to the original tail location (before
the new event was requested) and the rest of the sub buffer needs to be
"padded".

The race happens when a reader takes control of the sub buffer. As readers
do a "swap" of sub buffers from the ring buffer to get exclusive access to
the sub buffer, it replaces the "head" sub buffer with an empty sub buffer
that goes back into the writable portion of the ring buffer. This swap can
happen as soon as the writer moves to the next sub buffer and before it
updates the last sub buffer with padding.

Because the sub buffer can be released to the reader while the writer is
still updating the padding, it is possible for the reader to see the event
that goes past the end of the sub buffer. This can cause obvious issues.

To fix this, add a few memory barriers so that the reader definitely sees
the updates to the sub buffer, and also waits until the writer has put
back the "tail" of the sub buffer back to the last event that was written
on it.

To be paranoid, it will only spin for 1 second, otherwise it will
warn and shutdown the ring buffer code. 1 second should be enough as
the writer does have preemption disabled. If the writer doesn't move
within 1 second (with preemption disabled) something is horribly
wrong. No interrupt should last 1 second!

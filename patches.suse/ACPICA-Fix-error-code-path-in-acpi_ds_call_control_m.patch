Subject: [PATCH] ACPICA: Fix error code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()
Git-commit: 404ec60438add1afadaffaed34bb5fe4ddcadd40
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

A use-after-free in acpi_ps_parse_aml() after a failing invocaion of
acpi_ds_call_control_method() is reported by KASAN [1] and code
inspection reveals that next_walk_state pushed to the thread by
acpi_ds_create_walk_state() is freed on errors, but it is not popped
from the thread beforehand.  Thus acpi_ds_get_current_walk_state()
called by acpi_ps_parse_aml() subsequently returns it as the new
walk state which is incorrect.

To address this, make acpi_ds_call_control_method() call
acpi_ds_pop_walk_state() to pop next_walk_state from the thread before
returning an error.

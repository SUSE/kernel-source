Subject: drm/ttm: Provide a generic LRU walker helper
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: da966b82bf3d16f89a05732c933a589ec798d3f7
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

Provide a generic LRU walker in TTM, in the spirit of drm_gem_lru_scan()
but building on the restartable TTM LRU functionality.

The LRU walker optionally supports locking objects as part of
a ww mutex locking transaction, to mimic to some extent the
current functionality in ttm. However any -EDEADLK return
is converted to -ENOSPC and then to -ENOMEM before reaching
the driver, so that the driver will need to backoff and possibly retry
without being able to keep the ticket.

v3:
- Move the helper to core ttm.
- Remove the drm_exec usage from it for now, it will be
  reintroduced later in the series.
v4:
- Handle the -EALREADY case if ticketlocking.
v6:
- Some cleanup and added code comments (Matthew Brost)
- Clarified the ticketlock in the commit message (Matthew Brost)
v7:
- Use s64 rather than long for the target and progress
  (Christian König)
- Update documentation to not encourage using pages as a
  progress measure. (Christian König)
- Remove cond_resched(). (Christian König)

+ * The LRU lists of @man are walk, and for each struct ttm_resource encountered,

+ *
+ * With a locked object, the actions indicated by @walk->process_bo are
+ * performed, and after that, the bo is unlocked, the refcount dropped and the
+ * next struct ttm_resource is processed. Here, the walker relies on

+ * on error. Note that the definition of @target is done by the caller, it

+ * Note that the way dma_resv individualization is done, locking needs to be done

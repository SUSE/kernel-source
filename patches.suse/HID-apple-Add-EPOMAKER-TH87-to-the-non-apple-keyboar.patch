Subject: [PATCH] HID: apple: Add EPOMAKER TH87 to the non-apple keyboards list
Date: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 10:00:02 +0100
Message-ID: <20260224090004.73980-1-tiwai@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, linux-input ML
References: bsc#1258455

EPOMAKER TH87 has the very same ID as Apple Aluminum keyboard
(05ac:024f) although it doesn't work as expected in compatible way.

Put three entries to the non-apple keyboards list to exclude this
Device: one for BT ("TH87"), one for USB ("HFD Epomaker TH87") and one
for dongle ("2.4G Wireless Receiver").

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: cs42l51: Correct minimum value for SX volume control
Git-commit: fcb3b5a58926d16d9a338841b74af06d4c29be15
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc2
References: git-fixes

The minimum value for the PGA Volume is given as 0x1A, however the
values from there to 0x19 are all the same volume and this is not
represented in the TLV structure. The number of volumes given is correct
so this leads to all the volumes being shifted. Move the minimum value
up to 0x19 to fix this.

Subject: coresight: trbe: Work around write to out of range

Git-commit: f9efc79d0ab9b780bf74c624616bd50c6cefdeeb
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-19046

TRBE implementations affected by Arm erratum (2253138 or 2224489), could
write to the next address after the TRBLIMITR.LIMIT, instead of wrapping
to the TRBBASER. This implies that the TRBE could potentially corrupt :

  - A page used by the rest of the kernel/user (if the LIMIT = end of
    perf ring buffer)
  - A page within the ring buffer, but outside the driver's range.
    [head, head + size]. This may contain some trace data, may be
    consumed by the userspace.

We workaround this erratum by :
  - Making sure that there is at least an extra PAGE space left in the
    TRBE's range than we normally assign. This will be additional to other
    restrictions (e.g, the TRBE alignment for working around
    TRBE_WORKAROUND_OVERWRITE_IN_FILL_MODE, where there is a minimum of
    PAGE_SIZE. Thus we would have 2 * PAGE_SIZE)

  - Adjust the LIMIT to leave the last PAGE_SIZE out of the TRBE's allowed
    range (i.e, TRBEBASER...TRBLIMITR.LIMIT), by :

        TRBLIMITR.LIMIT -= PAGE_SIZE

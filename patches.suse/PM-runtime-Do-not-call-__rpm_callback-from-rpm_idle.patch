Subject: [PATCH] PM: runtime: Do not call __rpm_callback() from rpm_idle()
Git-commit: bc80c2e438dcbfcf748452ec0f7ad5b79ff3ad88
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

Calling __rpm_callback() from rpm_idle() after adding device links
support to the former is a clear mistake.

Not only it causes rpm_idle() to carry out unnecessary actions, but it
is also against the assumption regarding the stability of PM-runtime
status across __rpm_callback() invocations, because rpm_suspend() and
rpm_resume() may run in parallel with __rpm_callback() when it is called
by rpm_idle() and the device's PM-runtime status can be updated by any
of them.

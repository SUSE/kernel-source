Subject: driver core: faux: Quiet probe failures
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc2
Git-commit: ff53a6e247285687df1a71d8ee5c457939792c13
References: jsc#PED-14260

The acpi-einj conversion to faux_device_create() leads to a noisy error
message when the error injection facility is disabled. Quiet the error as
CXL error injection via ACPI expects the module to stay loaded even if the
error injection facility is disabled.

This situation arose because CXL knows proper kernel named objects to
trigger errors against, but acpi-einj knows how to perform the error
injection. The injection mechanism is shared with non-CXL use cases. The
result is CXL now has a module dependency on einj-core.ko, and init/probe
failures are handled at runtime.

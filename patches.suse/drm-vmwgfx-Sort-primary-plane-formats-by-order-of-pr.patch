Subject: [PATCH] drm/vmwgfx: Sort primary plane formats by order of preference
Git-commit: d4c972bff3129a9dd4c22a3999fd8eba1a81531a
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc5
References: git-fixes

The table of primary plane formats wasn't sorted at all, leading to
applications picking our least desirable formats by defaults.

Sort the primary plane formats according to our order of preference.

Nice side-effect of this change is that it makes IGT's kms_atomic
plane-invalid-params pass because the test picks the first format
which for vmwgfx was DRM_FORMAT_XRGB1555 and uses fb's with odd sizes
which make Pixman, which IGT depends on assert due to the fact that our
16bpp formats aren't 32 bit aligned like Pixman requires all formats
to be.

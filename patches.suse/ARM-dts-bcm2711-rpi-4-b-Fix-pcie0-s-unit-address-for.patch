Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2711-rpi-4-b: Fix pcie0's unit address formatting
Git-commit: 13dbc954b3c9a9de0ad5b7279e8d3b708d31068b
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc6
References: stable-5.14.14

commit 13dbc954b3c9a9de0ad5b7279e8d3b708d31068b upstream.

dtbs_check currently complains that:

arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts:220.10-231.4: Warning
(pci_device_reg): /scb/pcie@7d500000/pci@1,0: PCI unit address format
error, expected "0,0"

Unsurprisingly pci@0,0 is the right address, as illustrated by its reg
Property: 

    &pcie0 {
	    pci@0,0 {
		    /*
		     * As defined in the IEEE Std 1275-1994 document,
		     * reg is a five-cell address encoded as (phys.hi
		     * phys.mid phys.lo size.hi size.lo). phys.hi
		     * should contain the device's BDF as 0b00000000
		     * bbbbbbbb dddddfff 00000000. The other cells
		     * should be zero.
		     */
		    reg = <0 0 0 0 0>;
	    };
    };

The device is clearly 0. So fix it.

Also add a missing 'device_type = "pci"'.

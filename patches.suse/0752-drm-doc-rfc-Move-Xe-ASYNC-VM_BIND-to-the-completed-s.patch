Subject: drm/doc/rfc: Move Xe 'ASYNC VM_BIND' to the 'completed' section
Git-commit: 16805e994bff2db40362b9007f3fcd476571a15e
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: drm-backport-placeholder

As already indicated in this block, the consensus was already
reached out and documented as:
The ASYNC VM_BIND document </gpu/drm-vm-bind-async>

However this was item was not moved to the completed section.
Let's move and clean up the WIP block.

-ASYNC VM_BIND
--------------
-Although having a common DRM level IOCTL for VM_BIND is not a requirement to get
-Xe merged, it is mandatory to have a consensus with other drivers and Mesa.
-It needs to be clear how to handle async VM_BIND and interactions with userspace
-memory fences. Ideally with helper support so people don't get it wrong in all
-possible ways.
-
-As a key measurable result, the benefits of ASYNC VM_BIND and a discussion of
-various flavors, error handling and sample API suggestions are documented in

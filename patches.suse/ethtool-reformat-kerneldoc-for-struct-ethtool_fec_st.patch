Subject: ethtool: reformat kerneldoc for struct ethtool_fec_stats
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
Git-commit: 1271ca00aa7f9bb3fd94cb7ac8f654de71099580
References: bsc#1232798

The kerneldoc comment for struct ethtool_fec_stats attempts to describe the
"total" and "lanes" fields of the ethtool_fec_stat substructure in a way
leading to these warnings:

  ./include/linux/ethtool.h:424: warning: Excess struct member 'lane' description in 'ethtool_fec_stats'
  ./include/linux/ethtool.h:424: warning: Excess struct member 'total' description in 'ethtool_fec_stats'

Reformat the comment to retain the information while eliminating the
warnings.

Subject: [PATCH] pwm: imx-tpm: Use correct MODULO value for EPWM mode

Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc7
References: git-fixes

The modulo register defines the period of the edge-aligned PWM mode
(which is the only mode implemented). The reference manual states:
"The EPWM period is determined by (MOD + 0001h) ..." So the value that
is written to the MOD register must therefore be one less than the
calculated period length. Return -EINVAL if the calculated length is
already zero.
A correct MODULO value is particularly relevant if the PWM has to output
a high frequency due to a low period value.

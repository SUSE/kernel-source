Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: x86: Force StorageD3Enable on more products
Git-commit: e79a10652bbd320649da705ca1ea0c04351af403
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc4
References: stable-fixes

A Rembrandt-based HP thin client is reported to have problems where
the NVME disk isn't present after resume from s2idle.

This is because the NVME disk wasn't put into D3 at suspend, and
that happened because the StorageD3Enable _DSD was missing in the BIOS.

As AMD's architecture requires that the NVME is in D3 for s2idle, adjust
the criteria for force_storage_d3 to match *all* Zen SoCs when the FADT
advertises low power idle support.

This will ensure that any future products with this BIOS deficiency don't
need to be added to the allow list of overrides.

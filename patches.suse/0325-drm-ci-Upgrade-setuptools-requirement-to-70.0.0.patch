Subject: drm/ci: Upgrade setuptools requirement to 70.0.0
Git-commit: 52e371914ed37f531a8d8c3b4cf1a1af2753eb6d
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

GitHub Dependabot has issued the following alert:

"Upgrade setuptools to version 70.0.0 or later.

 A vulnerability in the package_index module of pypa/setuptools
 versions up to 69.1.1 allows for remote code execution via its
 download functions. These functions, which are used to download
 packages from URLs provided by users or retrieved from package
 index servers, are susceptible to code injection. If these
 functions are exposed to user-controlled inputs, such as package
 URLs, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. The
 issue is fixed in version 70.0.

 Severity: 8.8 / 10 (High)
 Attack vector:        Network
 Attack complexity:        Low
 Privileges required:     None
 User interaction:    Required
 Scope:              Unchanged
 Confidentiality:         High
 Integrity:               High
 Availability:            High
 CVE ID:         CVE-2024-6345"

To avoid disturbing everyone with the kernel repo hosted on GitHub,
I suggest we upgrade our python dependencies once again to appease
GitHub Dependabot.

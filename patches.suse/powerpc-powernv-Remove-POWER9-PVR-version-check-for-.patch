Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/powernv: Remove POWER9 PVR version check for entry
 and uaccess flushes

References: bsc#1188885 ltc#193722 git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: d02fa40d759ff9a53c93b10d8a4b591688982b26

These aren't necessarily POWER9 only, and it's not to say some new
vulnerability may not get discovered on other processors for which
we would like the flexibility of having the workaround enabled by
firmware.

Remove the restriction that the workarounds only apply to POWER9.

However POWER7 and POWER8 are not affected, and they may not have
older firmware that does not advertise this, so clear these workarounds
manually.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: chmap: Mark Channel Map controls as volatile
Git-commit: 210e6a844112bd7e28a04faedac677918e1f3040
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9993 jsc#PED-10202

The values returned from Playback Channel Map and Capture Channel Map
controls may vary dynamically depending on the corresponding PCM
stream.  Mark those as volatile to indicate the values are unstable
and not suitable for testing.

Note that we may change the driver to return -EINVAL, but this would
bring other side effects, such as "alsactl restore" would start
receiving unexpected errors.  So we still keep returning 0 for those
invalid inputs.

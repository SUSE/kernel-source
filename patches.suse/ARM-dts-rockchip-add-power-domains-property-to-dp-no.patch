Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rockchip: add power-domains property to dp node on rk3288
Git-commit: 80422339a75088322b4d3884bd12fa0fe5d11050
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc8
References: git-fixes

The clocks in the Rockchip rk3288 DisplayPort node are
included in the power-domain@RK3288_PD_VIO logic, but the
power-domains property in the dp node is missing, so fix it.

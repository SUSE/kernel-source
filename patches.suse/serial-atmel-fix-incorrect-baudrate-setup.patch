Subject: [PATCH] serial: atmel: fix incorrect baudrate setup
Git-commit: 5bfdd3c654bd879bff50c2e85e42f85ae698b42f
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc5
References: git-fixes

Commit ba47f97a18f2 ("serial: core: remove baud_rates when serial console
setup") changed uart_set_options to select the correct baudrate
configuration based on the absolute error between requested baudrate and
available standard baudrate settings.
Prior to that commit the baudrate was selected based on which predefined
standard baudrate did not exceed the requested baudrate.
This change of selection logic was never reflected in the atmel serial
driver. Thus the comment left in the atmel serial driver is no longer
accurate.
Additionally the manual rounding up described in that comment and applied
via (quot - 1) requests an incorrect baudrate. Since uart_set_options uses
tty_termios_encode_baud_rate to determine the appropriate baudrate flags
this can cause baudrate selection to fail entirely because
tty_termios_encode_baud_rate will only select a baudrate if relative error
between requested and selected baudrate does not exceed +/-2%.
Fix that by requesting actual, exact baudrate used by the serial.

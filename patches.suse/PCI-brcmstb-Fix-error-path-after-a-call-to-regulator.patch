Subject: [PATCH] PCI: brcmstb: Fix error path after a call to regulator_bulk_get()

Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

If the regulator_bulk_get() returns an error and no regulators
are created, we need to set their number to zero.

If we don't do this and the PCIe link up fails, a call to the
regulator_bulk_free() will result in a kernel panic.

While at it, print the error value, as we cannot return an error
upwards as the kernel will WARN() on an error from add_bus().

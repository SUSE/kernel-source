Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: qcom-hw: add CONFIG_COMMON_CLK dependency
Git-commit: 3093fa33539b54db77171d2919352ad4f044a1c5
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

It is still possible to compile-test a kernel without CONFIG_COMMON_CLK
for some ancient ARM boards or other architectures, but this causes a
link failure in the qcom-cpufreq-hw driver:

Error: modpost: "devm_clk_hw_register" [drivers/cpufreq/qcom-cpufreq-hw.ko] undefined!
Error: modpost: "devm_of_clk_add_hw_provider" [drivers/cpufreq/qcom-cpufreq-hw.ko] undefined!
Error: modpost: "of_clk_hw_onecell_get" [drivers/cpufreq/qcom-cpufreq-hw.ko] undefined!

Add a Kconfig dependency here to make sure this always work. Apparently
this bug has been in the kernel for a while without me running into it
on randconfig builds as COMMON_CLK is almost always enabled.

I have cross-checked by building an allmodconfig kernel with COMMON_CLK
disabled, which showed no other driver having this problem.

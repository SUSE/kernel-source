Subject: docs/bpf: Fix "file doesn't exist" warnings in {llvm_reloc,btf}.rst
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
Git-commit: 3888fa134eddac467b5a094949a8f0731ef6ffd5
References: jsc#PED-6811

scripts/documentation-file-ref-check reports warnings for (valid) cross-links
of form:

  :ref:`Documentation/bpf/btf <BTF_Ext_Section>`

Adding extension to the file name helps to avoid the warning, e.g:

  :ref:`Documentation/bpf/btf.rst <BTF_Ext_Section>`

Fixes: be4033d36070 ("docs/bpf: Add description for CO-RE relocations")

Subject: x86/numa: Fix the address overlap check in numa_fill_memblks()
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc6
Git-commit: 9b99c17f7510bed2adbe17751fb8abddba5620bc
References: git-fixes

numa_fill_memblks() fills in the gaps in numa_meminfo memblks over a
physical address range. To do so, it first creates a list of existing
memblks that overlap that address range. The issue is that it is off
by one when comparing to the end of the address range, so memblks
that do not overlap are selected.

The impact of selecting a memblk that does not actually overlap is
that an existing memblk may be filled when the expected action is to
do nothing and return NUMA_NO_MEMBLK to the caller. The caller can
then add a new NUMA node and memblk.

Replace the broken open-coded search for address overlap with the
memblock helper memblock_addrs_overlap(). Update the kernel doc
and in code comments.

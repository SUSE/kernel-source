Subject: treewide: fix typo "previlege"
Git-commit: 2e27fa943b74c9fc5fdf93090508c3c722531c66
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499 jsc#PED-15868

There are some spelling mistakes of 'previlege' in comments which
should be 'privilege'.

Fix them and add it to scripts/spelling.txt.

The typo in arch/loongarch/kvm/main.c was corrected by a different
patch [1] and is therefore not included in this submission.

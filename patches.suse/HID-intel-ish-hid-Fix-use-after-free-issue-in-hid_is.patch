Subject: [PATCH] HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in hid_ishtp_cl_remove()
Git-commit: 823987841424289339fdb4ba90e6d2c3792836db
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: git-fixes

During the `rmmod` operation for the `intel_ishtp_hid` driver, a
use-after-free issue can occur in the hid_ishtp_cl_remove() function.
The function hid_ishtp_cl_deinit() is called before ishtp_hid_remove(),
which can lead to accessing freed memory or resources during the
removal process.

Call Trace:

 ...

Additionally, ishtp_hid_remove() is a HID level power off, which should
occur before the ISHTP level disconnect.

This patch resolves the issue by reordering the calls in
hid_ishtp_cl_remove(). The function ishtp_hid_remove() is now
called before hid_ishtp_cl_deinit().

Commit 62d89a7d49af ("video: fbdev: matroxfb: set maxvram of vbG200eW to
the same as vbG200 to avoid black screen") accidently decreases the
maximum memory size for the Matrox G200eW (102b:0532) from 8 MB to 1 MB
by missing one zero. This caused the driver initialization to fail with
the messages below, as the minimum required VRAM size is 2 MB:

     [    9.436420] matroxfb: Matrox MGA-G200eW (PCI) detected
     [    9.444502] matroxfb: cannot determine memory size
     [    9.449316] matroxfb: probe of 0000:0a:03.0 failed with error -1

So, add the missing 0 to make it the intended 16 MB. Successfully tested on
the Dell PowerEdge R910/0KYD3D, BIOS 2.10.0 08/29/2013, that the warning is
gone.

While at it, add a leading 0 to the maxdisplayable entry, so itâ€™s aligned
properly. The value could probably also be increased from 8 MB to 16 MB, as
the G200 uses the same values, but I have not checked any datasheet.

Note, matroxfb is obsolete and superseded by the maintained DRM driver
mga200, which is used by default on most systems where both drivers are
available. Therefore, on most systems it was only a cosmetic issue.

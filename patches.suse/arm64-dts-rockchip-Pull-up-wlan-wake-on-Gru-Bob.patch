Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Pull up wlan wake# on Gru-Bob
Git-commit: e5467359a725de90b6b8d0dd865500f6373828ca
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc7
References: git-fixes

The Gru-Bob board does not have a pull-up resistor on its
WLAN_HOST_WAKE# pin, but Kevin does. The production/vendor kernel
specified the pin configuration correctly as a pull-up, but this didn't
get ported correctly to upstream.

This means Bob's WLAN_HOST_WAKE# pin is floating, causing inconsistent
wakeup behavior.

Note that bt_host_wake_l has a similar dynamic, but apparently the
upstream choice was to redundantly configure both internal and external
pull-up on Kevin (see the "Kevin has an external pull up" comment in
rk3399-gru.dtsi). This doesn't cause any functional problem, although
it's perhaps wasteful.

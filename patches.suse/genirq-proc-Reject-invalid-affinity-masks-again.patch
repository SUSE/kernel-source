Subject: [PATCH] genirq/proc: Reject invalid affinity masks (again)
Git-commit: cba6437a1854fde5934098ec3bd0ee83af3129f5
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc3
References: git-fixes

Qian Cai reported that the WARN_ON() in the x86/msi affinity setting code,
which catches cases where the affinity setting is not done on the CPU which
is the current target of the interrupt, triggers during CPU hotplug stress
testing.

It turns out that the warning which was added with the commit addressing
the MSI affinity race unearthed yet another long standing bug.

If user space writes a bogus affinity mask, i.e. it contains no online CPUs,
then it calls irq_select_affinity_usr(). This was introduced for ALPHA in

  eee45269b0f5 ("[PATCH] Alpha: convert to generic irq framework (generic part)")

and subsequently made available for all architectures in

  18404756765c ("genirq: Expose default irq affinity mask (take 3)")

which introduced the circumvention of the affinity setting restrictions for
interrupt which cannot be moved in process context.

The whole exercise is bogus in various aspects:

  1) If the interrupt is already started up then there is absolutely
     no point to honour a bogus interrupt affinity setting from user
     space. The interrupt is already assigned to an online CPU and it
     does not make any sense to reassign it to some other randomly
     chosen online CPU.

  2) If the interupt is not yet started up then there is no point
     either. A subsequent startup of the interrupt will invoke
     irq_setup_affinity() anyway which will chose a valid target CPU.

So the only correct solution is to just return -EINVAL in case user space
wrote an affinity mask which does not contain any online CPUs, except for
ALPHA which has it's own magic sauce for this.

Fixes: 18404756765c ("genirq: Expose default irq affinity mask (take 3)")

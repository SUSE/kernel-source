Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries: Fix use after free in remove_phb_dynamic()

References: bsc#1065729 bsc#1198660 ltc#197803
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
Git-commit: fe2640bd7a62f1f7c3f55fbda31084085075bc30

In remove_phb_dynamic() we use &phb->io_resource, after we've called
device_unregister(&host_bridge->dev). But the unregister may have freed
phb, because pcibios_free_controller_deferred() is the release function
for the host_bridge.

If there are no outstanding references when we call device_unregister()
then phb will be freed out from under us.

This has gone mainly unnoticed, but with slub_debug and page_poison
enabled it can lead to a crash:

To avoid it, we can take a reference to the host_bridge->dev until we're
done using phb. Then when we drop the reference the phb will be freed.

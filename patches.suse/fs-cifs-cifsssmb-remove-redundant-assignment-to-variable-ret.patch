Subject: [PATCH] fs: cifs: cifsssmb: remove redundant assignment to variable
 ret
Git-commit: 1afdea4f19a97ed98f65c41fd11c77e5264838ae
References: bsc#1164565
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1

The variable ret is being initialized however this is never read
and later it is being reassigned to a new value. The initialization
is redundant and hence can be removed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused Value")

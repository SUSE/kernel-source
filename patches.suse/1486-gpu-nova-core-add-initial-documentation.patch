Add the initial documentation of the Nova project.

The initial project documentation consists out of a brief introduction
of the project, as well as project guidelines both general and nova-core
specific and a task list for nova-core specifically.

The task list is divided into tasks for general Rust infrastructure
required by the project, tasks regarding GSP enablement and firmware
abstraction, general GPU driver tasks as well as tasks related to
external API design and test infrastructure.

+Guidelines
+==========
+
+This documents contains the guidelines for nova-core. Additionally, all common
+guidelines of the Nova project do apply.
+
+Driver API
+==========
+
+One main purpose of nova-core is to implement the abstraction around the
+firmware interface of GSP and provide a firmware (version) independent API for
+2nd level drivers, such as nova-drm or the vGPU manager VFIO driver.
+
+Therefore, it is not permitted to leak firmware (version) specifics, through the
+driver API, to 2nd level drivers.
+
+Acceptance Criteria
+===================
+
+- To the extend possible, patches submitted to nova-core must be tested for
+  regressions with all 2nd level drivers.

+Task List
+=========
+
+Tasks may have the following fields:
+
+- ``Complexity``: Describes the required familiarity with Rust and / or the
+  corresponding kernel APIs or subsystems. There are four different complexities,
+  ``Beginner``, ``Intermediate``, ``Advanced`` and ``Expert``.
+- ``Reference``: References to other tasks.
+- ``Link``: Links to external resources.
+- ``Contact``: The person that can be contacted for further information about
+  the task.
+
+Enablement (Rust)
+=================
+
+Tasks that are not directly related to nova-core, but are preconditions in terms
+of required APIs.
+
+FromPrimitive API
+-----------------
+
+Sometimes the need arises to convert a number to a value of an enum or a
+structure.
+
+A good example from nova-core would be the ``Chipset`` enum type, which defines
+the value ``AD102``. When probing the GPU the value ``0x192`` can be read from a
+certain register indication the chipset AD102. Hence, the enum value ``AD102``
+should be derived from the number ``0x192``. Currently, nova-core uses a custom
+implementation (``Chipset::from_u32`` for this.
+
+Instead, it would be desirable to have something like the ``FromPrimitive``
+trait [1] from the num crate.
+
+Having this generalization also helps with implementing a generic macro that
+automatically generates the corresponding mappings between a value and a number.
+
+| Complexity: Beginner
+| Link: https://docs.rs/num/latest/num/trait.FromPrimitive.html
+
+Generic register abstraction
+----------------------------
+
+Work out how register constants and structures can be automatically generated
+through generalized macros.
+
+Example:
+
+.. code-block:: rust
+
+	register!(BOOT0, 0x0, u32, pci::Bar<SIZE>, Fields [
+	   MINOR_REVISION(3:0, RO),
+	   MAJOR_REVISION(7:4, RO),
+	   REVISION(7:0, RO), // Virtual register combining major and minor rev.
+	])
+
+This could expand to something like:
+
+.. code-block:: rust
+
+	const BOOT0_OFFSET: usize = 0x00000000;
+	const BOOT0_MINOR_REVISION_SHIFT: u8 = 0;
+	const BOOT0_MINOR_REVISION_MASK: u32 = 0x0000000f;
+	const BOOT0_MAJOR_REVISION_SHIFT: u8 = 4;
+	const BOOT0_MAJOR_REVISION_MASK: u32 = 0x000000f0;
+	const BOOT0_REVISION_SHIFT: u8 = BOOT0_MINOR_REVISION_SHIFT;
+	const BOOT0_REVISION_MASK: u32 = BOOT0_MINOR_REVISION_MASK | BOOT0_MAJOR_REVISION_MASK;
+
+	struct Boot0(u32);
+
+	impl Boot0 {
+	   #[inline]
+	   fn read(bar: &RevocableGuard<'_, pci::Bar<SIZE>>) -> Self {
+	      Self(bar.readl(BOOT0_OFFSET))
+	   }
+
+	   #[inline]
+	   fn minor_revision(&self) -> u32 {
+	      (self.0 & BOOT0_MINOR_REVISION_MASK) >> BOOT0_MINOR_REVISION_SHIFT
+	   }
+
+	   #[inline]
+	   fn major_revision(&self) -> u32 {
+	      (self.0 & BOOT0_MAJOR_REVISION_MASK) >> BOOT0_MAJOR_REVISION_SHIFT
+	   }
+
+	   #[inline]
+	   fn revision(&self) -> u32 {
+	      (self.0 & BOOT0_REVISION_MASK) >> BOOT0_REVISION_SHIFT
+	   }
+	}
+
+Usage:
+
+.. code-block:: rust
+
+	let bar = bar.try_access().ok_or(ENXIO)?;
+
+	let boot0 = Boot0::read(&bar);
+	pr_info!("Revision: {}\n", boot0.revision());

+GPU System Processor (GSP)
+==========================
+
+Export GSP log buffers
+----------------------
+
+Recent patches from Timur Tabi [1] added support to expose GSP-RM log buffers
+(even after failure to probe the driver) through debugfs.
+
+This is also an interesting feature for nova-core, especially in the early days.

+| Reference: Debugfs abstractions
+| Complexity: Intermediate
+
+GSP firmware abstraction
+------------------------
+
+The GSP-RM firmware API is unstable and may incompatibly change from version to
+version, in terms of data structures and semantics.
+
+This problem is one of the big motivations for using Rust for nova-core, since
+it turns out that Rust's procedural macro feature provides a rather elegant way
+to address this issue:
+
+1. generate Rust structures from the C headers in a separate namespace per version
+2. build abstraction structures (within a generic namespace) that implement the
+   firmware interfaces; annotate the differences in implementation with version
+   identifiers
+3. use a procedural macro to generate the actual per version implementation out
+   of this abstraction
+4. instantiate the correct version type one on runtime (can be sure that all
+   have the same interface because it's defined by a common trait)
+
+There is a PoC implementation of this pattern, in the context of the nova-core
+PoC driver.
+
+This task aims at refining the feature and ideally generalize it, to be usable
+by other drivers as well.

+
+nova-core C API
+---------------

+
+| Complexity: Intermediate
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+CI pipeline
+-----------
+
+Investigate option for continuous integration testing.
+
+This can go from as simple as running KUnit tests over running (graphics) CTS to
+booting up (multiple) guest VMs to test VFIO use-cases.
+
+It might also be worth to consider the introduction of a new test suite directly
+sitting on top of the uAPI for more targeted testing and debugging. There may be
+options for collaboration / shared code with the Mesa project.

+Guidelines
+==========
+
+This document describes the general project guidelines that apply to nova-core
+and nova-drm.
+
+Language
+========
+
+The Nova project uses the Rust programming language. In this context, all rules
+of the Rust for Linux project as documented in
+:doc:`../../rust/general-information` apply. Additionally, the following rules
+apply.
+
+- Unless technically necessary otherwise (e.g. uAPI), any driver code is written
+  in Rust.
+
+- Unless technically necessary, unsafe Rust code must be avoided. In case of
+  technical necessity, unsafe code should be isolated in a separate component
+  providing a safe API for other driver code to use.
+
+Style
+-----
+
+All rules of the Rust for Linux project as documented in
+:doc:`../../rust/coding-guidelines` apply.
+
+For a submit checklist, please also see the `Rust for Linux Submit checklist
+addendum <https://rust-for-linux.com/contributing#submit-checklist-addendum>`_.
+
+Documentation
+=============
+
+The availability of proper documentation is essential in terms of scalability,
+accessibility for new contributors and maintainability of a project in general,
+but especially for a driver running as complex hardware as Nova is targeting.
+
+Hence, adding documentation of any kind is very much encouraged by the project.
+
+Besides that, there are some minimum requirements.
+
+- Every non-private structure needs at least a brief doc comment explaining the
+  semantical sense of the structure, as well as potential locking and lifetime
+  requirements. It is encouraged to have the same minimum documentation for
+  non-trivial private structures.
+
+- uAPIs must be fully documented with kernel-doc comments; additionally, the
+  semantical behavior must be explained including potential special or corner
+  cases.
+
+- The APIs connecting the 1st level driver (nova-core) with 2nd level drivers
+  must be fully documented. This includes doc comments, potential locking and
+  lifetime requirements, as well as example code if applicable.
+
+- Abbreviations must be explained when introduced; terminology must be uniquely
+  defined.
+
+- Register addresses, layouts, shift values and masks must be defined properly;
+  unless obvious, the semantical sense must be documented. This only applies if
+  the author is able to obtain the corresponding information.
+
+Acceptance Criteria
+===================
+
+- Patches must only be applied if reviewed by at least one other person on the
+  mailing list; this also applies for maintainers.

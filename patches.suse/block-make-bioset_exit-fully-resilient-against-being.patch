Subject: [PATCH] block: make bioset_exit() fully resilient against being
 called twice
Git-commit: 605f7415ecfb426610195dd6c7577b30592b3369
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1183

Most of bioset_exit() is fine being called twice, as it clears the
various allocations etc when they are freed. The exception is
bio_alloc_cache_destroy(), which does not clear ->cache when it has
freed it.

This isn't necessarily a bug, but can be if buggy users does call the
exit path more then once, or with just a memset() bioset which has
never been initialized. dm appears to be one such user.

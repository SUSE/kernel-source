Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: pcm: Set missing stop_operating flag at undoing trigger start
Git-commit: 5c8cc93b06d1ff860327a273abf3ac006290d242
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

When a PCM trigger-start fails at snd_pcm_do_start(), PCM core tries
to undo the action at snd_pcm_undo_start() by issuing the trigger STOP
manually.  At that point, we forgot to set the stop_operating flag,
hence the sync-stop won't be issued at the next prepare or other
calls.

This patch adds the missing stop_operating flag at
snd_pcm_undo_start().

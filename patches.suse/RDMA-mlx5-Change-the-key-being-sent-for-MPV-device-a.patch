Subject: RDMA/mlx5: Change the key being sent for MPV device affiliation
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
Git-commit: 02e7d139e5e24abb5fde91934fc9dc0344ac1926
References: jsc#PED-3311

Change the key that we send from IB driver to EN driver regarding the
MPV device affiliation, since at that stage the IB device is not yet
initialized, so its index would be zero for different IB devices and
cause wrong associations between unrelated master and slave devices.

Instead use a unique value from inside the core device which is already
initialized at this stage.

Subject: [PATCH] spi: tegra114: Don't fail set_cs_timing when delays are zero
Git-commit: 4426e6b4ecf632bb75d973051e1179b8bfac2320
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc5
References: git-fixes

The original code would skip null delay pointers, but when the pointers
were converted to point within the spi_device struct, the check was not
updated to skip delays of zero. Hence all spi devices that didn't set
delays would fail to probe.

Fixes: 04e6bb0d6bb1 ("spi: modify set_cs_timing parameter")

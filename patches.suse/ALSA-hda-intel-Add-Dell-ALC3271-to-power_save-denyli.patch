Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: intel: Add Dell ALC3271 to power_save denylist
Git-commit: 1ee5aa765c22a0577ec552d460bf2035300b4b51
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc6
References: stable-fixes

Dell XPS 13 7390 with the Realtek ALC3271 codec experiences
persistent humming noise when the power_save mode is enabled.
This issue occurs when the codec enters power saving mode,
leading to unwanted noise from the speakers.

This patch adds the affected model (PCI ID 0x1028:0x0962) to the
power_save denylist to ensure power_save is disabled by default,
preventing power-off related noise issues.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Boot the system with `snd_hda_intel` loaded.
2. Verify that `power_save` mode is enabled:
```sh
cat /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save
````
Output: 10 (default power save timeout)
3. Wait for the power save timeout
4. Observe a persistent humming noise from the speakers
5. Disable `power_save` manually:
```sh
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save
````
6. Confirm that the noise disappears immediately.

This issue has been observed on my system, and this patch
successfully eliminates the unwanted noise. If other users
experience similar issues, additional reports would be helpful.

Subject: [PATCH for 6.1 regression] Revert "mm/compaction: fix set skip in
 fast_find_migrateblock"
Patch-mainline: Submitted, https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230113173345.9692-1-vbabka@suse.cz/
References: bsc#1206848

This reverts commit 7efc3b7261030da79001c00d92bc3392fd6c664c.

We have got openSUSE reports (Link 1) for 6.1 kernel with khugepaged
stalling CPU for long periods of time. Investigation of tracepoint data
shows that compaction is stuck in repeating fast_find_migrateblock()
based migrate page isolation, and then fails to migrate all isolated
pages. Commit 7efc3b726103 ("mm/compaction: fix set skip in
fast_find_migrateblock") was suspected as it was merged in 6.1 and in
theory can indeed remove a termination condition for
fast_find_migrateblock() under certain conditions, as it removes a place
that always marks a scanned pageblock from being re-scanned. There are
other such places, but those can be skipped under certain conditions,
which seems to match the tracepoint data.

Testing of revert also appears to have resolved the issue, thus revert
the commit until a more robust solution for the original problem is
developed.

It's also likely this will fix qemu stalls with 6.1 kernel reported in
Link 2, but that is not yet confirmed.

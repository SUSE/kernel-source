Subject: Revert "mm/compaction: fix set skip in fast_find_migrateblock"
Git-commit: 95e7a450b8190673675836bfef236262ceff084a
Patch-mainline: 6.2-rc6
References: bsc#1206848

This reverts commit 7efc3b7261030da79001c00d92bc3392fd6c664c.

We have got openSUSE reports (Link 1) for 6.1 kernel with khugepaged
stalling CPU for long periods of time.  Investigation of tracepoint data
shows that compaction is stuck in repeating fast_find_migrateblock()
based migrate page isolation, and then fails to migrate all isolated
pages.

Commit 7efc3b726103 ("mm/compaction: fix set skip in fast_find_migrateblock")
was suspected as it was merged in 6.1 and in theory can indeed remove a
termination condition for fast_find_migrateblock() under certain
conditions, as it removes a place that always marks a scanned pageblock
from being re-scanned.  There are other such places, but those can be
skipped under certain conditions, which seems to match the tracepoint
data.

Testing of revert also appears to have resolved the issue, thus revert
the commit until a more robust solution for the original problem is
developed.

It's also likely this will fix qemu stalls with 6.1 kernel reported in
Link 2, but that is not yet confirmed.

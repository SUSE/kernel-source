Subject: [PATCH 1/1] RDMA/siw: Balance the reference of cep->kref in the error
 path
Git-commit: b056327bee09e6b86683d3f709a438ccd6031d72
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

The siw_connect can go to err in below after cep is allocated successfully:

1. If siw_cm_alloc_work returns failure. In this case socket is not
assoicated with cep so siw_cep_put can't be called by siw_socket_disassoc.
We need to call siw_cep_put twice since cep->kref is increased once after
it was initialized.

2. If siw_cm_queue_work can't find a work, which means siw_cep_get is not
called in siw_cm_queue_work, so cep->kref is increased twice by siw_cep_get
and when associate socket with cep after it was initialized. So we need to
call siw_cep_put three times (one in siw_socket_disassoc).

3. siw_send_mpareqrep returns error, this scenario is similar as 2.

So we need to remove one siw_cep_put in the error path.

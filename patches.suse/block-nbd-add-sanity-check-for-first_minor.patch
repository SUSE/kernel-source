Subject: [PATCH] block: nbd: add sanity check for first_minor
Git-commit: b1a811633f7321cf1ae2bb76a66805b7720e44c9
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: stable-5.14.4

[ Upstream commit b1a811633f7321cf1ae2bb76a66805b7720e44c9 ]

Syzbot hit WARNING in internal_create_group(). The problem was in
too big disk->first_minor.

disk->first_minor is initialized by value, which comes from userspace
and there wasn't any sanity checks about value correctness. It can cause
duplicate creation of sysfs files/links, because disk->first_minor will
be passed to MKDEV() which causes truncation to byte. Since maximum
minor value is 0xff, let's check if first_minor is correct minor number.

Note: the root case of the reported warning was in wrong error handling
in register_disk(), but we can avoid passing knowingly wrong values to
sysfs API, because sysfs error messages can confuse users. For example:
user passed 1048576 as index, but sysfs complains about duplicate
creation of /dev/block/43:0. It's not obvious how 1048576 becomes 0.
Log and reproducer for above example can be found on syzkaller bug
report page.

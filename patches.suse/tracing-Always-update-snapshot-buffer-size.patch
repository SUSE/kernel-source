Subject: tracing: Always update snapshot buffer size
Git-commit: 7be76461f302ec05cbd62b90b2a05c64299ca01f
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc5
References: git-fixes

It use to be that only the top level instance had a snapshot buffer (for
latency tracers like wakeup and irqsoff). The update of the ring buffer
size would check if the instance was the top level and if so, it would
also update the snapshot buffer as it needs to be the same as the main
buffer.

Now that lower level instances also has a snapshot buffer, they too need
to update their snapshot buffer sizes when the main buffer is changed,
otherwise the following can be triggered:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 # echo 1500 > buffer_size_kb
 # mkdir instances/foo
 # echo irqsoff > instances/foo/current_tracer
 # echo 1000 > instances/foo/buffer_size_kb

Produces:

 WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 856 at kernel/trace/trace.c:1938 update_max_tr_single.part.0+0x27d/0x320

Which is:

	ret = ring_buffer_swap_cpu(tr->max_buffer.buffer, tr->array_buffer.buffer, cpu);

	if (ret == -EBUSY) {
		[..]
	}

	WARN_ON_ONCE(ret && ret != -EAGAIN && ret != -EBUSY);  <== here

That's because ring_buffer_swap_cpu() has:

	int ret = -EINVAL;

	[..]

	/* At least make sure the two buffers are somewhat the same */
	if (cpu_buffer_a->nr_pages != cpu_buffer_b->nr_pages)
		goto out;

	[..]
 out:
	return ret;
 }

Instead, update all instances' snapshot buffer sizes when their main
buffer size is updated.

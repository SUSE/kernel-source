Subject: Revert "net: af_key: add check for pfkey_broadcast in function pfkey_process"
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/klassert/ipsec.git
Git-commit: 9c90c9b3e50e16d03c7f87d63e9db373974781e0

This reverts commit 4dc2a5a8f6754492180741facf2a8787f2c415d7.

A non-zero return value from pfkey_broadcast() does not necessarily mean
an error occurred as this function returns -ESRCH when no registered
listener received the message. In particular, a call with
BROADCAST_PROMISC_ONLY flag and null one_sk argument can never return
zero so that this commit in fact prevents processing any PF_KEY message.
One visible effect is that racoon daemon fails to find encryption
algorithms like aes and refuses to start.

Excluding -ESRCH return value would fix this but it's not obvious that
we really want to bail out here and most other callers of
pfkey_broadcast() also ignore the return value. Also, as pointed out by
Steffen Klassert, PF_KEY is kind of deprecated and newer userspace code
should use netlink instead so that we should only disturb the code for
really important fixes.

v2: add a comment explaining why is the return value ignored

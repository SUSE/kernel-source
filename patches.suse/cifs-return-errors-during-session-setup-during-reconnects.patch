Subject: [PATCH] cifs: return errors during session setup during reconnects
Git-commit: 8ea21823aa584b55ba4b861307093b78054b0c1b
References: bsc#1193629
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc2

During reconnects, we check the return value from
cifs_negotiate_protocol, and have handlers for both success
and failures. But if that passes, and cifs_setup_session
returns any errors other than -EACCES, we do not handle
that. This fix adds a handler for that, so that we don't
go ahead and try a tree_connect on a failed session.

Subject: vfio-ccw: Check initialized flag in cp_init()
Git-commit: c6c82e0cd8125d30f2f1b29205c7e1a2f1a6785b
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc4
References: git-fixes

We have a really nice flag in the channel_program struct that
indicates if it had been initialized by cp_init(), and use it
as a guard in the other cp accessor routines, but not for a
duplicate call into cp_init(). The possibility of this occurring
is low, because that flow is protected by the private->io_mutex
and FSM CP_PROCESSING state. But then why bother checking it
in (for example) cp_prefetch() then?

Let's just be consistent and check for that in cp_init() too.

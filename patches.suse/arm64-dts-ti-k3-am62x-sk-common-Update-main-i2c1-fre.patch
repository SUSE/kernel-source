Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62x-sk-common: Update main-i2c1 frequency
Git-commit: 73387da70f9c26b6fba4f62371d013cce14663d9
Patch-mainline: v6.6
References: git-fixes

The Display Data Channel (DDC) transactions between an HDMI transmitter
(SIL9022A in this case) and an HDMI monitor, occur at a maximum of
100KHz. That's the maximum supported frequency within DDC standards.

While the SIL9022A can transact with the core at 400KHz, it needs to
drop the frequency to 100KHz when communicating with the monitor,
otherwise, the i2c controller times out and shows warning like this.

[  985.773431] omap_i2c 20010000.i2c: controller timed out

That feature, however, has not been enabled in the SIL9022 driver.

Since, dropping the frequency doesn't affect any other devices on the
bus, drop the main-i2c1 frequency from 400KHz to 100KHz.

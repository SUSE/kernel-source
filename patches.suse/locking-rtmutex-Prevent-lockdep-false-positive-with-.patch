Subject: [PATCH] locking/rtmutex: Prevent lockdep false positive with PI
Git-commit: 51711e825a6d1b2fe7ca46bb06d08c25d97656ee
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1190137 bsc#1189998
 futexes

On PREEMPT_RT the futex hashbucket spinlock becomes 'sleeping' and rtmutex
based. That causes a lockdep false positive because some of the futex
functions invoke spin_unlock(&hb->lock) with the wait_lock of the rtmutex
associated to the pi_futex held.  spin_unlock() in turn takes wait_lock of
the rtmutex on which the spinlock is based which makes lockdep notice a
lock recursion.

Give the futex/rtmutex wait_lock a separate key.

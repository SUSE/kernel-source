Subject: [PATCH] i3c: master: support to adjust first broadcast address speed
Git-commit: aef79e189ba2b32f78bd35daf2c0b41f3868a321
References: jsc#PED-10702
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1

According to I3C spec 6.2 Timing Specification, the Open Drain High Period
of SCL Clock timing for first broadcast address should be adjusted to 200ns
at least. I3C device working as i2c device will see the broadcast to close
its Spike Filter then change to work at I3C mode. After that I3C open drain
SCL high level should be adjusted back.

Subject: [PATCH] Input: bcm5974 - check endpoint type before starting traffic
Git-commit: 2b9c3eb32a699acdd4784d6b93743271b4970899
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc3
References: git-fixes

syzbot has found a type mismatch between a USB pipe and the transfer
endpoint, which is triggered by the bcm5974 driver[1].

This driver expects the device to provide input interrupt endpoints and
if that is not the case, the driver registration should terminate.

Repros are available to reproduce this issue with a certain setup for
the dummy_hcd, leading to an interrupt/bulk mismatch which is caught in
the USB core after calling usb_submit_urb() with the following message:
"BOGUS urb xfer, pipe 1 != type 3"

Some other device drivers (like the appletouch driver bcm5974 is mainly
based on) provide some checking mechanism to make sure that an IN
interrupt endpoint is available. In this particular case the endpoint
addresses are provided by a config table, so the checking can be
targeted to the provided endpoints.

Add some basic checking to guarantee that the endpoints available match
the expected type for both the trackpad and button endpoints.

This issue was only found for the trackpad endpoint, but the checking
has been added to the button endpoint as well for the same reasons.

Given that there was never a check for the endpoint type, this bug has
been there since the first implementation of the driver (f89bd95c5c94).

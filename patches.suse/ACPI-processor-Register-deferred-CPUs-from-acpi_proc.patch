Subject: ACPI: processor: Register deferred CPUs from
 acpi_processor_get_info()
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
Git-commit: b398a91decd9d4b399389a12675ea7716039b964
References: jsc#PED-11164

The arm64 specific arch_register_cpu() call may defer CPU registration
until the ACPI interpreter is available and the _STA method can
be evaluated.

If this occurs, then a second attempt is made in
acpi_processor_get_info(). Note that the arm64 specific call has
not yet been added so for now this will be called for the original
hotplug case.

For architectures that do not defer until the ACPI Processor
driver loads (e.g. x86), for initially present CPUs there will
already be a CPU device. If present do not try to register again.

Systems can still be booted with 'acpi=off', or not include an
ACPI description at all as in these cases arch_register_cpu()
will not have deferred registration when first called.

This moves the CPU register logic back to a subsys_initcall(),
while the memory nodes will have been registered earlier.
Note this is where the call was prior to the cleanup series so
there should be no side effects of moving it back again for this
specific case.

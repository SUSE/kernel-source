Subject: [PATCH] dm: remove flush_scheduled_work() during local_exit()
Git-commit: 0b22ff5360f5c4e11050b89206370fdf7dc0a226
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

Commit acfe0ad74d2e1 ("dm: allocate a special workqueue for deferred
device removal") switched from using system workqueue to a single
workqueue local to DM.  But it didn't eliminate the call to
flush_scheduled_work() that was introduced purely for the benefit of
deferred device removal with commit 2c140a246dc ("dm: allow remove to
be deferred").

Since DM core uses its own workqueue (and queue_work) there is no need
to call flush_scheduled_work() from local_exit().  local_exit()'s
destroy_workqueue(deferred_remove_workqueue) handles flushing work
started with queue_work().

Fixes: acfe0ad74d2e1 ("dm: allocate a special workqueue for deferred device removal")

Subject: perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix pt_topa_entry_for_page() address calculation
Git-commit: 3520b251dcae2b4a27b95cd6f745c54fd658bda5
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

Currently, perf allocates an array of page pointers which is limited in
size by MAX_PAGE_ORDER. That in turn limits the maximum Intel PT buffer
size to 2GiB. Should that limitation be lifted, the Intel PT driver can
support larger sizes, except for one calculation in
pt_topa_entry_for_page(), which is limited to 32-bits.

Fix pt_topa_entry_for_page() address calculation by adding a cast.

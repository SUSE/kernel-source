Subject: [PATCH] alarmtimer: Prevent starvation by small intervals and SIG_IGN
Git-commit: d125d1349abeb46945dc5e98f7824bf688266f13
Patch-mainline: v6.2
References: git-fixes

syzbot reported a RCU stall which is caused by setting up an alarmtimer
with a very small interval and ignoring the signal. The reproducer arms the
alarm timer with a relative expiry of 8ns and an interval of 9ns. Not a
problem per se, but that's an issue when the signal is ignored because then
the timer is immediately rearmed because there is no way to delay that
rearming to the signal delivery path.  See posix_timer_fn() and commit
58229a189942 ("posix-timers: Prevent softirq starvation by small intervals
and SIG_IGN") for details.

The reproducer does not set SIG_IGN explicitely, but it sets up the timers
signal with SIGCONT. That has the same effect as explicitely setting
SIG_IGN for a signal as SIGCONT is ignored if there is no handler set and
the task is not ptraced.

The log clearly shows that:

   [pid  5102] --- SIGCONT {si_signo=SIGCONT, si_code=SI_TIMER, si_timerid=0, si_overrun=316014, si_int=0, si_ptr=NULL} ---

It works because the tasks are traced and therefore the signal is queued so
the tracer can see it, which delays the restart of the timer to the signal
delivery path. But then the tracer is killed:

   [pid  5087] kill(-5102, SIGKILL <unfinished ...>
   ...
   ./strace-static-x86_64: Process 5107 detached

and after it's gone the stall can be observed:

posix_timer_fn() prevents that by checking whether the interval for
timers which have the signal ignored is smaller than a jiffie and
artifically delay it by shifting the next expiry out by a jiffie. That's
accurate vs. the overrun accounting, but slightly inaccurate
vs. timer_gettimer(2).

The comment in that function says what needs to be done and there was a fix
available for the regular userspace induced SIG_IGN mechanism, but that did
not work due to the implicit ignore for SIGCONT and similar signals. This
needs to be worked on, but for now the only available workaround is to do
exactly what posix_timer_fn() does:

Increase the interval of self-rearming timers, which have their signal
ignored, to at least a jiffie.

Interestingly this has been fixed before via commit ff86bf0c65f1
("alarmtimer: Rate limit periodic intervals") already, but that fix got
lost in a later rework.

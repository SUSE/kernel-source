Subject: nvme: always punt polled uring_cmd end_io work to task_work
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc2
Git-commit: 9ce6c9875f3e995be5fd720b65835291f8a609b1
References: git-fixes

Currently NVMe uring_cmd completions will complete locally, if they are
polled. This is done because those completions are always invoked from
task context. And while that is true, there's no guarantee that it's
invoked under the right ring context, or even task. If someone does
NVMe passthrough via multiple threads and with a limited number of
poll queues, then ringA may find completions from ringB. For that case,
completing the request may not be sound.

Always just punt the passthrough completions via task_work, which will
redirect the completion, if needed.

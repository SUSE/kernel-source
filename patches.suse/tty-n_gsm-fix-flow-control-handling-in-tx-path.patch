Subject: [PATCH] tty: n_gsm: fix flow control handling in tx path
Git-commit: 59ff0680ecbfec742b1e0381e7cc46b41eb06647
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

The current implementation constipates all transmission paths during flow
control except for flow control frames. However, these may not be located
at the beginning of the transmission queue of the control channel.
Ensure that flow control frames in the transmission queue for the control
channel are always handled even if constipated by skipping through other
messages.

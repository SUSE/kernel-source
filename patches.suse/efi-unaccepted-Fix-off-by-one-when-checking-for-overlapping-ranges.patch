Subject: efi/unaccepted: Fix off-by-one when checking for overlapping ranges
Git-commit: 01b1e3ca0e5ce47bbae8217d47376ad01b331b07
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc4
References: jsc#PED-7167

When a task needs to accept memory it will scan the accepting_list
to see if any ranges already being processed by other tasks overlap
with its range. Due to an off-by-one in the range comparisons, a task
might falsely determine that an overlapping range is being accepted,
leading to an unnecessary delay before it begins processing the range.

Fix the off-by-one in the range comparison to prevent this and slightly
improve performance.

Subject: ACPI: resource: Add TongFang GM5HG0A to
 irq1_edge_low_force_override[]
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc7
Git-commit: 7ed4e4a659d99499dc6968c61970d41b64feeac0
References: jsc#PED-12273

The TongFang GM5HG0A is a TongFang barebone design which is sold under
various brand names.

The ACPI IRQ override for the keyboard IRQ must be used on these AMD Zen
laptops in order for the IRQ to work.

At least on the SKIKK Vanaheim variant the DMI product- and board-name
strings have been replaced by the OEM with "Vanaheim" so checking that
board-name contains "GM5HG0A" as is usually done for TongFang barebones
quirks does not work.

The DMI OEM strings do contain "GM5HG0A". I have looked at the dmidecode
for a few other TongFang devices and the TongFang code-name string being
in the OEM strings seems to be something which is consistently true.

Add a quirk checking one of the DMI_OEM_STRING(s) is "GM5HG0A" in the hope
that this will work for other OEM versions of the "GM5HG0A" too.

Subject: [PATCH] kselftests: dmabuf-heaps: Ensure the driver name is null-terminated
Git-commit: 291e4baf70019f17a81b7b47aeb186b27d222159
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc2
References: stable-fixes

Even if a vgem device is configured in, we will skip the import_vgem_fd()
test almost every time.

  TAP version 13
  1..11
  # Testing heap: system
  # =======================================
  # Testing allocation and importing:
  ok 1 # SKIP Could not open vgem -1

The problem is that we use the DRM_IOCTL_VERSION ioctl to query the driver
version information but leave the name field a non-null-terminated string.
Terminate it properly to actually test against the vgem device.

While at it, let's check the length of the driver name is exactly 4 bytes
and return early otherwise (in case there is a name like "vgemfoo" that
gets converted to "vgem\0" unexpectedly).

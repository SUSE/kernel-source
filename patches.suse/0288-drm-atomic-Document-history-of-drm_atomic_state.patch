Subject: drm/atomic: Document history of drm_atomic_state
Git-commit: 56339ffaeaf87cce070c2437df71dc3340598be0
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

After some discussions on the mailing-list for an earlier revision of
the series, it was suggested to document the evolution of
drm_atomic_state and its use by drivers to explain some of the confusion
one might still encounter when reading the framework code.

  * States are added to an atomic update by calling drm_atomic_get_crtc_state(),
  * drm_atomic_get_plane_state(), drm_atomic_get_connector_state(), or for
  * private state structures, drm_atomic_get_private_obj_state().
+ *
+ * NOTE: struct drm_atomic_state first started as a single collection of
+ * entities state pointers (drm_plane_state, drm_crtc_state, etc.).
+ *
+ * At atomic_check time, you could get the state about to be committed
+ * from drm_atomic_state, and the one currently running from the
+ * entities state pointer (drm_crtc.state, for example). After the call
+ * to drm_atomic_helper_swap_state(), the entities state pointer would
+ * contain the state previously checked, and the drm_atomic_state
+ * structure the old state.
+ *
+ * Over time, and in order to avoid confusion, drm_atomic_state has
+ * grown to have both the old state (ie, the state we replace) and the
+ * new state (ie, the state we want to apply). Those names are stable
+ * during the commit process, which makes it easier to reason about.
+ *
+ * You can still find some traces of that evolution through some hooks
+ * or callbacks taking a drm_atomic_state parameter called names like
+ * "old_state". This doesn't necessarily mean that the previous
+ * drm_atomic_state is passed, but rather that this used to be the state
+ * collection we were replacing after drm_atomic_helper_swap_state(),
+ * but the variable name was never updated.
+ *
+ * Some atomic operations implementations followed a similar process. We
+ * first started to pass the entity state only. However, it was pretty
+ * cumbersome for drivers, and especially CRTCs, to retrieve the states
+ * of other components. Thus, we switched to passing the whole
+ * drm_atomic_state as a parameter to those operations. Similarly, the
+ * transition isn't complete yet, and one might still find atomic
+ * operations taking a drm_atomic_state pointer, or a component state
+ * pointer. The former is the preferred form.

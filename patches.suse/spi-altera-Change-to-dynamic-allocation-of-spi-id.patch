Subject: [PATCH] spi: altera: Change to dynamic allocation of spi id
Git-commit: f09f6dfef8ce7b70a240cf83811e2b1909c3e47b
Patch-mainline: v5.15
References: stable-5.14.19

[ Upstream commit f09f6dfef8ce7b70a240cf83811e2b1909c3e47b ]

The spi-altera driver has two flavors: platform and dfl. I'm seeing
a case where I have both device types in the same machine, and they
are conflicting on the SPI ID:

... kernel: couldn't get idr
... kernel: WARNING: CPU: 28 PID: 912 at drivers/spi/spi.c:2920 spi_register_controller.cold+0x84/0xc0a

Both the platform and dfl drivers use the parent's driver ID as the SPI
ID. In the error case, the parent devices are dfl_dev.4 and
subdev_spi_altera.4.auto. When the second spi-master is created, the
failure occurs because the SPI ID of 4 has already been allocated.

Change the ID allocation to dynamic (by initializing bus_num to -1) to
avoid duplicate SPI IDs.

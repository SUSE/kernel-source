Subject: drm/i915: Allow the initial async flip to change modifier
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 7c800d957173298a5c80576db7384ebfe6efc10c
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

With Xorg+modesetting on skl+ we see the following behaviour:
1. root pixmap is X-tiled
2. client submitted buffers can be Y-tiled (w/ 'Option "dmabuf_capable"')
3. we try to switch from the X-tiled buffer to the Y-tiled buffer
   using an async flip (when vsync is disabled).
4. the async flip will be rejected by i915 due to the modifier change

Relax the rules a bit by turning the first async flip into a sync
flip so that we can change the modifier if necessary. Note that
we already convert the first async flip into a sync flip on adl+
in order to reprogram the watermarks.

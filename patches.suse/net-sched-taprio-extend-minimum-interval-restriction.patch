Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to
 entire cycle too
Git-commit: fb66df20a7201e60f2b13d7f95d031b31a8831d3
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc2
References: CVE-2024-36244 bsc#1226797

[ Droped tools/testing/selftests/tc-testing/tc-tests/qdiscs/taprio.json hunk ]

It is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by the
blamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits a
cycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of
entry intervals.

We need one more restriction, which is that the cycle time itself must
be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number of schedule
entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether the cycle
time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so
we move the existing "cycle == 0" check outside the "if "(!new->cycle_time)"
branch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.

Add a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot.

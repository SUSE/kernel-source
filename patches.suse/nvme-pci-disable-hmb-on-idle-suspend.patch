Subject: nvme-pci: disable hmb on idle suspend
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
Git-commit: e5ad96f388b765fe6b52f64f37e910c0ba4f3de7
References: bsc#1190569

An idle suspend may or may not disable host memory access from devices
placed in low power mode. Either way, it should always be safe to
disable the host memory buffer prior to entering the low power mode, and
this should also always be faster than a full device shutdown.

Subject: thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev
 removal
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc7
Git-commit: d351eb0ab04c3e8109895fc33250cebbce9c11da
References: jsc#PED-11164

Since thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it can
run in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may free
the struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been
checked against NULL.

If that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory
that has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.

Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around
the cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the
same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

Subject: [PATCH 07/28] bnxt_en: Fix bnxt_reinit_after_abort() code path
Git-commit: 4279414bff8af9898e8c53ae6c5bc17f68ad67b7
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7
References: git-fixes

bnxt_reinit_after_abort() is called during ifup when a previous
FW reset sequence has aborted or a previous ifup has failed after
detecting FW reset.  In all cases, it is safe to assume that a
previous FW reset has completed and the driver may not have fully
reinitialized.

Prior to this patch, it is assumed that the
FUNC_DRV_IF_CHANGE_RESP_FLAGS_HOT_FW_RESET_DONE flag will always be
set by the firmware in bnxt_hwrm_if_change().  This may not be true if
the driver has already attempted to register with the firmware.  The
firmware may not set the RESET_DONE flag again after the driver has
registered, assuming that the driver has seen the flag already.

Fix it to always go through the FW reset initialization path if
the BNXT_STATE_FW_RESET_DET flag is set.  This flag is always set
by the driver after successfully going through bnxt_reinit_after_abort().

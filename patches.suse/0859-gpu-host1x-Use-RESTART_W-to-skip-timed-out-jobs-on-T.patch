Subject: gpu: host1x: Use RESTART_W to skip timed out jobs on Tegra186+
Git-commit: 0ae4ae9158f32fd77e8736da0585d8aff5a3b9d9
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

When MLOCK enforcement is enabled, the 0-word write currently done
is rejected by the hardware outside of an MLOCK region. As such,
on these chips, which also have the newer, more convenient RESTART_W
opcode, use that instead to skip over the timed out job.

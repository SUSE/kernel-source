Subject: [PATCH] net: usb: pegasus: Do not drop long Ethernet frames
Git-commit: ca506fca461b260ab32952b610c3d4aadc6c11fd
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc8

The D-Link DSB-650TX (2001:4002) is unable to receive Ethernet frames
that are longer than 1518 octets, for example, Ethernet frames that
contain 802.1Q VLAN tags.

The frames are sent to the pegasus driver via USB but the driver
discards them because they have the Long_pkt field set to 1 in the
received status report. The function read_bulk_callback of the pegasus
driver treats such received "packets" (in the terminology of the
hardware) as errors but the field simply does just indicate that the
Ethernet frame (MAC destination to FCS) is longer than 1518 octets.

It seems that in the 1990s there was a distinction between
"giant" (> 1518) and "runt" (< 64) frames and the hardware includes
flags to indicate this distinction. It seems that the purpose of the
distinction "giant" frames was to not allow infinitely long frames due
to transmission errors and to allow hardware to have an upper limit of
the frame size. However, the hardware already has such limit with its
2048 octet receive buffer and, therefore, Long_pkt is merely a
convention and should not be treated as a receive error.

Actually, the hardware is even able to receive Ethernet frames with 2048
octets which exceeds the claimed limit frame size limit of the driver of
1536 octets (PEGASUS_MTU).

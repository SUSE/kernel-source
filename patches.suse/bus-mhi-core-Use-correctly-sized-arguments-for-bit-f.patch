Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: core: Use correctly sized arguments for bit field
Git-commit: 5a717e93239fc373a314e03e45c43b62ebea1b26
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsc#1206451

The find.h APIs are designed to be used only on unsigned long arguments.
This can technically result in a over-read, but it is harmless in this
case. Regardless, fix it to avoid the warning seen under -Warray-bounds,
which we'd like to enable globally:

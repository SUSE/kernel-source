Subject: [PATCH] nvmet: pci-epf: Always configure BAR0 as 64-bit
Git-commit: 1cf0184c0ac4f1e936bb3b089894bbeb0a9eb2bc
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9651

NVMe PCIe Transport Specification 1.1, section 2.1.10, claims that the
BAR0 type is Implementation Specific.

However, in NVMe 1.1, the type is required to be 64-bit.

Thus, to make our PCI EPF work on as many host systems as possible,
always configure the BAR0 type to be 64-bit.

In the rare case that the underlying PCI EPC does not support configuring
BAR0 as 64-bit, the call to pci_epc_set_bar() will fail, and we will
return a failure back to the user.

This should not be a problem, as most PCI EPCs support configuring a BAR
as 64-bit (and those EPCs with .only_64bit set to true in epc_features
only support configuring the BAR as 64-bit).

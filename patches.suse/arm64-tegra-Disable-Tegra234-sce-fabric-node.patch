Subject: arm64: tegra: Disable Tegra234 sce-fabric node
Git-commit: a5e6fc0a10fe280989f1367a3b4f8047c7d00ea6
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

Access to safety cluster engine (SCE) fabric registers was blocked
by firewall after the introduction of Functional Safety Island in
Tegra234. After that, any access by software to SCE registers is
correctly resulting in the internal bus error. However, when CPUs
try accessing the SCE-fabric registers to print error info,
another firewall error occurs as the fabric registers are also
firewall protected. This results in a second error to be printed.
Disable the SCE fabric node to avoid printing the misleading error.
The first error info will be printed by the interrupt from the
fabric causing the actual access.

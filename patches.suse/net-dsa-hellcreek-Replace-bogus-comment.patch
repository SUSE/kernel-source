Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: hellcreek: Replace bogus comment

References: bsc#1232534 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
Git-commit: ae3683a34265381cd4bc006295a091009c7215d1

Replace bogus comment about matching the latched timestamp to one of the
received frames. That comment is probably copied from mv88e6xxx and true for
these switches. However, the hellcreek switch is configured to insert the
timestamp directly into the PTP packets.

While here, remove the other comments regarding the list splicing and locking as
well, because it doesn't add any value.

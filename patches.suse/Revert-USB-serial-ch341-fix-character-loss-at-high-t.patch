This reverts commit 3c18e9baee0ef97510dcda78c82285f52626764b.

These devices do not appear to send a zero-length packet when the
transfer size is a multiple of the bulk-endpoint max-packet size. This
means that incoming data may not be processed by the driver until a
short packet is received or the receive buffer is full.

Revert back to using endpoint-sized receive buffers to avoid stalled
reads.

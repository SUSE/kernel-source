Subject: [PATCH] soc: qcom: socinfo: add two missing PMIC IDs
Git-commit: 2fae3ecc70405b72ea6c923b216d34547559d6a9
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes stable-5.14.19

Add IDs for PMK8001 and PMI8996. They also fall in the list of
'duplicated' IDs, where the same index was used for multiple chips.

Fixes: 7fda2b0bfbd9 ("soc: qcom: socinfo: import PMIC IDs from pmic-spmi")

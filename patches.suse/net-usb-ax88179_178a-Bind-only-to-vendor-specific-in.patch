Subject: [PATCH] net: usb: ax88179_178a: Bind only to vendor-specific interface
Git-commit: c67cc4315a8e605ec875bd3a1210a549e3562ddc
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: bsc#1218948

The Anker PowerExpand USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet adapter uses this
chipset, but exposes CDC Ethernet configurations as well as the
vendor specific one. This driver tries to bind by PID:VID
unconditionally and ends up picking up the CDC configuration, which
is supposed to be handled by the class driver. To make things even
more confusing, it sees both of the CDC class interfaces and tries
to bind twice, resulting in two broken Ethernet devices.

Change all the ID matches to specifically match the vendor-specific
interface. By default the device comes up in CDC mode and is bound by
that driver (which works fine); users may switch it to the vendor
interface using sysfs to set bConfigurationValue, at which point the
device actually goes through a reconnect cycle and comes back as a
vendor specific only device, and then this driver binds and works too.

The affected device uses VID/PID 0b95:1790, but we might as well change
all of them for good measure, since there is no good reason for this
driver to bind to standard CDC Ethernet interfaces.

V3: Added VID/PID info to commit message

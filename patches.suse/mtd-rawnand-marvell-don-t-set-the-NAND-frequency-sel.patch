Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: marvell: don't set the NAND frequency select
Git-commit: c4d28e30a8d0b979e4029465ab8f312ab6ce2644
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc5
References: git-fixes

marvell_nfc_setup_interface() uses the frequency retrieved from the
clock associated with the nand interface to determine the timings that
will be used. By changing the NAND frequency select without reflecting
this in the clock configuration this means that the timings calculated
don't correctly meet the requirements of the NAND chip. This hasn't been
an issue up to now because of a different bug that was stopping the
timings being updated after they were initially set.

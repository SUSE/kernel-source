Subject: iommu/amd: Increase timeout waiting for GA log enablement

Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: bsc#1199052

On some systems it can take a long time for the hardware to enable the
GA log of the AMD IOMMU. The current wait time is only 0.1ms, but
testing showed that it can take up to 14ms for the GA log to enter
running state after it has been enabled.

Sometimes the long delay happens when booting the system, sometimes
only on resume. Adjust the timeout accordingly to not print a warning
when hardware takes a longer than usual.

There has already been an attempt to fix this with commit

	9b45a7738eec ("iommu/amd: Fix loop timeout issue in iommu_ga_log_enable()")

But that commit was based on some wrong math and did not fix the issue
in all cases.

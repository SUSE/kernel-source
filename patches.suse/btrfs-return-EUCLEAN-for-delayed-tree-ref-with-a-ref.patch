Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: return -EUCLEAN for delayed tree ref with a ref count
 not equals to 1
Git-commit: 1bf76df3fee56d6637718e267f7c34ed70d0c7dc
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc4
References: git-fixes

When running a delayed tree reference, if we find a ref count different
from 1, we return -EIO. This isn't an IO error, as it indicates either a
bug in the delayed refs code or a memory corruption, so change the error
code from -EIO to -EUCLEAN. Also tag the branch as 'unlikely' as this is
not expected to ever happen, and change the error message to print the
tree block's bytenr without the parenthesis (and there was a missing space
between the 'block' word and the opening parenthesis), for consistency as
that's the style we used everywhere else.

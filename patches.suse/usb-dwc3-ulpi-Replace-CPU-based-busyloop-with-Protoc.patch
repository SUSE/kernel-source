Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: ulpi: Replace CPU-based busyloop with Protocol-based one
Git-commit: fca3f138105727c3a22edda32d02f91ce1bf11c9
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc3
References: git-fixes

Originally the procedure of the ULPI transaction finish detection has been
developed as a simple busy-loop with just decrementing counter and no
delays. It's wrong since on different systems the loop will take a
different time to complete. So if the system bus and CPU are fast enough
to overtake the ULPI bus and the companion PHY reaction, then we'll get to
take a false timeout error. Fix this by converting the busy-loop procedure
to take the standard bus speed, address value and the registers access
mode into account for the busy-loop delay calculation.

Here is the way the fix works. It's known that the ULPI bus is clocked
with 60MHz signal. In accordance with [1] the ULPI bus protocol is created
so to spend 5 and 6 clock periods for immediate register write and read
operations respectively, and 6 and 7 clock periods - for the extended
register writes and reads. Based on that we can easily pre-calculate the
time which will be needed for the controller to perform a requested IO
operation. Note we'll still preserve the attempts counter in case if the
DWC USB3 controller has got some internals delays.

Subject: net/mlx5e: Fix trust state reset in reload
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc6
Git-commit: b781bff882d16175277ca129c382886cb4c74a2c
References: git-fixes

Setting dscp2prio during the driver reload can cause dcb ieee app list to
be not empty after the reload finish and as a result to a conflict between
the priority trust state reported by the app and the state in the device
register.

Reset the dcb ieee app list on initialization in case this is
conflicting with the register status.

Fixes: 2a5e7a1344f4 ("net/mlx5e: Add dcbnl dscp to priority support")

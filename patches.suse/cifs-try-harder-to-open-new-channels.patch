Subject: [PATCH] cifs: try harder to open new channels
Git-commit: 65a37a34145ca64fd2e0df2f477aadeb389990bc
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1192606

Previously we would only loop over the iface list once.
This patch tries to loop over multiple times until all channels are
opened. It will also try to reuse RSS ifaces.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: marvell: cn9130: enable CP0 GPIO controllers
Git-commit: 0734f8311ce72c9041e5142769eff2083889c172
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

CN9130 has a built-in CP115 which has 2 GPIO controllers, but unlike in
Armada 7k and 8k both are left disabled by the SoC DTSI.

This first of all makes no sense as they are always present due to being
SoC built-in and its an issue as boards like CN9130-CRB use the CPO GPIO2
pins for regulators and SD card support without enabling them first.

So, enable both of them like Armada 7k and 8k do.

Fixes: 6b8970bd8d7a ("arm64: dts: marvell: Add support for Marvell CN9130 SoC support")

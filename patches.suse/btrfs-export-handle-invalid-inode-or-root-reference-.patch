Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: export: handle invalid inode or root reference in
 btrfs_get_parent()
Git-commit: 26b66d1d366a375745755ca7365f67110bbf6bd5
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: git-fixes

The get_parent handler looks up a parent of a given dentry, this can be
either a subvolume or a directory. The search is set up with offset -1
but it's never expected to find such item, as it would break allowed
range of inode number or a root id. This means it's a corruption (ext4
also returns this error code).

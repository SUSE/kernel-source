Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Fix last interface check for registration
Git-commit: 39efc9c8a973ddff5918191525d1679d0fb368ea
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

The recent fix in commit 6392dcd1d0c7 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Register card
at the last interface") tried to delay the card registration until the
last found interface is probed.  It assumed that the probe callback
gets called for those later interfaces, but it's not always true; as
the driver loops over the descriptor and probes the matching ones,
it's not separately called via multiple probe calls.  This results in
the missing card registration, i.e. no sound device.

For addressing this problem, replace the check whether the last
interface is processed with usb_interface_claimed() instead of the
comparison with the probe interface number.

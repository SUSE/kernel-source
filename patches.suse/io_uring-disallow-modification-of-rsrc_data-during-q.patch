Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: disallow modification of rsrc_data during quiesce
Git-commit: 80912cef18f16f8fe59d1fb9548d4364342be360
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc6
References: bsc#1205205

io_rsrc_ref_quiesce will unlock the uring while it waits for references to
the io_rsrc_data to be killed.
There are other places to the data that might add references to data via
calls to io_rsrc_node_switch.
There is a race condition where this reference can be added after the
completion has been signalled. At this point the io_rsrc_ref_quiesce call
will wake up and relock the uring, assuming the data is unused and can be
freed - although it is actually being used.

To fix this check in io_rsrc_ref_quiesce if a resource has been revived.

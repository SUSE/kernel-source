Subject: [PATCH] VFS: filename_create(): fix incorrect intent.
Git-commit: b3d4650d82c71b9c9a8184de9e8bb656012b289e
Patch-mainline: v5.18
References: bsc#1197534

When asked to create a path ending '/', but which is not to be a
directory (LOOKUP_DIRECTORY not set), filename_create() will never try
to create the file.  If it doesn't exist, -ENOENT is reported.

However, it still passes LOOKUP_CREATE|LOOKUP_EXCL to the filesystems
->lookup() function, even though there is no intent to create.  This is
misleading and can cause incorrect behaviour.

If you try

   ln -s foo /path/dir/

where 'dir' is a directory on an NFS filesystem which is not currently
known in the dcache, this will fail with ENOENT.

But as the name is not in the dcache, nfs_lookup gets called with
LOOKUP_CREATE|LOOKUP_EXCL and so it returns NULL without performing any
lookup, with the expectation that a subsequent call to create the target
will be made, and the lookup can be combined with the creation.  In the
case with a trailing '/' and no LOOKUP_DIRECTORY, that call is never
made.  Instead filename_create() sees that the dentry is not (yet)
positive and returns -ENOENT - even though the directory actually
exists.

So only set LOOKUP_CREATE|LOOKUP_EXCL if there really is an intent to
create, and use the absence of these flags to decide if -ENOENT should
be returned.

Note that filename_parentat() is only interested in LOOKUP_REVAL, so we
split that out and store it in 'reval_flag'.  __lookup_hash() then gets
reval_flag combined with whatever create flags were determined to be
needed.

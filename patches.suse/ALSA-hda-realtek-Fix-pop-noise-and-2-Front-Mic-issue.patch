This is a Lenovo ThinkStation machine which uses the codec alc623.
There are 2 issues on this machine, the 1st one is the pop noise in
the lineout, the 2nd one is there are 2 Front Mics and pulseaudio
can't handle them, After applying the fixup of
ALC623_FIXUP_LENOVO_THINKSTATION_P340 to this machine, the 2 issues
are fixed.

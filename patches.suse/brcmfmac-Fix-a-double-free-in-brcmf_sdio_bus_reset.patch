Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: Fix a double-free in brcmf_sdio_bus_reset
Git-commit: 7ea7a1e05c7ff5ffc9f9ec1f0849f6ceb7fcd57c
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: git-fixes

brcmf_sdiod_remove has been called inside brcmf_sdiod_probe when fails,
so there's no need to call another one. Otherwise, sdiodev->freezer
would be double freed.

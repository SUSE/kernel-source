Subject: [PATCH] usb: typec: tcpm: Do not disconnect while receiving VBUS off
Git-commit: 90b8aa9f5b09edae6928c0561f933fec9f7a9987
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc2
References: git-fixes

With some chargers, vbus might momentarily raise above VSAFE5V and fall
back to 0V before tcpm gets to read port->tcpc->get_vbus. This will
will report a VBUS off event causing TCPM to transition to
SNK_UNATTACHED where it should be waiting in either SNK_ATTACH_WAIT
or SNK_DEBOUNCED state. This patch makes TCPM avoid vbus off events
while in SNK_ATTACH_WAIT or SNK_DEBOUNCED state.

Stub from the spec:
    "4.5.2.2.4.2 Exiting from AttachWait.SNK State
    A Sink shall transition to Unattached.SNK when the state of both
    the CC1 and CC2 pins is SNK.Open for at least tPDDebounce.
    A DRP shall transition to Unattached.SRC when the state of both
    the CC1 and CC2 pins is SNK.Open for at least tPDDebounce."

[23.194131] CC1: 0 -> 0, CC2: 0 -> 5 [state SNK_UNATTACHED, polarity 0, connected]
[23.201777] state change SNK_UNATTACHED -> SNK_ATTACH_WAIT [rev3 NONE_AMS]
[23.209949] pending state change SNK_ATTACH_WAIT -> SNK_DEBOUNCED @ 170 ms [rev3 NONE_AMS]
[23.300579] VBUS off
[23.300668] state change SNK_ATTACH_WAIT -> SNK_UNATTACHED [rev3 NONE_AMS]
[23.301014] VBUS VSAFE0V
[23.301111] Start toggling

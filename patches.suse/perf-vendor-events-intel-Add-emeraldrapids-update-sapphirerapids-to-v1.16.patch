Subject: perf vendor events intel: Add emeraldrapids, update sapphirerapids to
 v1.16
Git-commit: 8c994eff8fcfe8ecb1f1dbebed25b4d7bb75be12
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: perf-v6.7 (jsc#PED-6012 jsc#PED-6121)

Add emeraldrapids events that were added at intel's perfmon site in:

  https://github.com/intel/perfmon/pull/98

  "EMR, SPR, CLX, SKX, BDX, HSX, BDW-DE, WSM-EP*, NHM-*, JKT, IVT : Release event
   updates"

  "Emerald Rapids (0xCF) was previously pointing to SPR core. In this
   pull request dedicated EMR files are introduced."

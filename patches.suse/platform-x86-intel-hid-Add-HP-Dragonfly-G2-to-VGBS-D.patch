Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86/intel/hid: Add HP Dragonfly G2 to VGBS DMI quirks
Git-commit: 7783e97f8558ad7a4d1748922461bc88483fbcdf
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc4
References: git-fixes

HP Elite Dragonfly G2 (a convertible laptop/tablet) has a reliable VGBS
method. If VGBS is not called on boot, the firmware sends an initial
0xcd event shortly after calling the BTNL method, but only if the device
is booted in the laptop mode. However, if the device is booted in the
tablet mode and VGBS is not called, there is no initial 0xcc event, and
the input device for SW_TABLET_MODE is not registered up until the user
turns the device into the laptop mode.

Call VGBS on boot on this device to get the initial state of
SW_TABLET_MODE in a reliable way.

Tested with BIOS 1.13.1.

Subject: [PATCH] cifs: fix missed refcounting of ipc tcon
Git-commit: 65de262a209da0951eb9bc60b3b7faf3bbffa38a
References: bsc#1200217
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc4

Fix missed refcounting of IPC tcon used for getting domain-based DFS
root referrals.  We want to keep it alive as long as mount is active
and can be refreshed.  For standalone DFS root referrals it wouldn't
be a problem as the client ends up having an IPC tcon for both mount
and cache.

Fixes: c88f7dcd6d64 ("cifs: support nested dfs links over reconnect")

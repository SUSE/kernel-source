Subject: PCI/ACPI: Fix runtime PM ref imbalance on Hot-Plug Capable ports
Git-commit: 6cff20ce3b92ffbf2fc5eb9e5a030b3672aa414a
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

pci_bridge_d3_possible() is called from both pcie_portdrv_probe() and
pcie_portdrv_remove() to determine whether runtime power management shall
be enabled (on probe) or disabled (on remove) on a PCIe port.

The underlying assumption is that pci_bridge_d3_possible() always returns
the same value, else a runtime PM reference imbalance would occur.  That
assumption is not given if the PCIe port is inaccessible on remove due to
hot-unplug:  pci_bridge_d3_possible() calls pciehp_is_native(), which
accesses Config Space to determine whether the port is Hot-Plug Capable.
An inaccessible port returns "all ones", which is converted to "all
zeroes" by pcie_capability_read_dword().  Hence the port no longer seems
Hot-Plug Capable on remove even though it was on probe.

The resulting runtime PM ref imbalance causes warning messages such as:

  pcieport 0000:02:04.0: Runtime PM usage count underflow!

Avoid the Config Space access (and thus the runtime PM ref imbalance) by
caching the Hot-Plug Capable bit in struct pci_dev.

The struct already contains an "is_hotplug_bridge" flag, which however is
not only set on Hot-Plug Capable PCIe ports, but also Conventional PCI
Hot-Plug bridges and ACPI slots.  The flag identifies bridges which are
allocated additional MMIO and bus number resources to allow for hierarchy
expansion.

The kernel is somewhat sloppily using "is_hotplug_bridge" in a number of
places to identify Hot-Plug Capable PCIe ports, even though the flag
encompasses other devices.  Subsequent commits replace these occurrences
with the new flag to clearly delineate Hot-Plug Capable PCIe ports from
other kinds of hotplug bridges.

Document the existing "is_hotplug_bridge" and the new "is_pciehp" flag
and document the (non-obvious) requirement that pci_bridge_d3_possible()
always returns the same value across the entire lifetime of a bridge,
including its hot-removal.

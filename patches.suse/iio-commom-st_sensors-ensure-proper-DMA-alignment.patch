Subject: [PATCH] iio: commom: st_sensors: ensure proper DMA alignment
Git-commit: 862cf85fef85becc55a173387527adb4f076fab0
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc5
References: git-fixes

Aligning the buffer to the L1 cache is not sufficient in some platforms
as they might have larger cacheline sizes for caches after L1 and thus,
we can't guarantee DMA safety.

That was the whole reason to introduce IIO_DMA_MINALIGN in [1]. Do the same
for st_sensors common buffer.

While at it, moved the odr_lock before buffer_data as we definitely
don't want any other data to share a cacheline with the buffer.

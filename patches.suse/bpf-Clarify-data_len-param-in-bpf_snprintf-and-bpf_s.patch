Subject: bpf: Clarify data_len param in bpf_snprintf and bpf_seq_printf
 comments
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
Git-commit: a42effb0b24fcaf49513c2d7d77ef6daa9e32a6f
References: jsc#PED-1377

Since the data_len in these two functions is a byte len of the preceding
u64 *data array, it must always be a multiple of 8. If this isn't the
case both helpers error out, so let's make the requirement explicit so
users don't need to infer it.

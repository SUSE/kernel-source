Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Leave most VM-Exit info fields unmodified on
 failed VM-Entry

Don't modify vmcs12 exit fields except EXIT_REASON and EXIT_QUALIFICATION
when performing a nested VM-Exit due to failed VM-Entry.  Per the SDM,
only the two aformentioned fields are filled and "All other VM-exit
information fields are unmodified".

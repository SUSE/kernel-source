Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: felix: fix broken VLAN-tagged PTP under VLAN-aware bridge

[ Upstream commit 92f62485b3715882cd397b0cbd80a96d179b86d6 ]

Normally it is expected that the dsa_device_ops :: rcv() method finishes
parsing the DSA tag and consumes it, then never looks at it again.

But commit c0bcf537667c ("net: dsa: ocelot: add hardware timestamping
support for Felix") added support for RX timestamping in a very
unconventional way. On this switch, a partial timestamp is available in
the DSA header, but the driver got away with not parsing that timestamp
right away, but instead delayed that parsing for a little longer:

Dsa_switch_rcv(): nskb = cpu_dp->rcv(skb, dev); <------------- not here	-> ocelot_rcv()	...

	skb = nskb;
	skb_push(skb, ETH_HLEN);
	skb->pkt_type = PACKET_HOST;
	skb->protocol = eth_type_trans(skb, skb->dev);

	...

	if (dsa_skb_defer_rx_timestamp(p, skb)) <--- but here
	-> felix_rxtstamp()
		return 0;

When in felix_rxtstamp(), this driver accounted for the fact that
eth_type_trans() happened in the meanwhile, so it got a hold of the
extraction header again by subtracting (ETH_HLEN + OCELOT_TAG_LEN) bytes
from the current skb->data.

This worked for quite some time but was quite fragile from the very
beginning. Not to mention that having DSA tag parsing split in two
different files, under different folders (net/dsa/tag_ocelot.c vs
drivers/net/dsa/ocelot/felix.c) made it quite non-obvious for patches to
come that they might break this.

Finally, the blamed commit does the following: at the end of
ocelot_rcv(), it checks whether the skb payload contains a VLAN header.
If it does, and this port is under a VLAN-aware bridge, that VLAN ID
might not be correct in the sense that the packet might have suffered
VLAN rewriting due to TCAM rules (VCAP IS1). So we consume the VLAN ID
from the skb payload using __skb_vlan_pop(), and take the classified
VLAN ID from the DSA tag, and construct a hwaccel VLAN tag with the
classified VLAN, and the skb payload is VLAN-untagged.

The big problem is that __skb_vlan_pop() does:

	memmove(skb->data + VLAN_HLEN, skb->data, 2 * ETH_ALEN);
	__skb_pull(skb, VLAN_HLEN);

aka it moves the Ethernet header 4 bytes to the right, and pulls 4 bytes
from the skb headroom (effectively also moving skb->data, by definition).
So for felix_rxtstamp()'s fragile logic, all bets are off now.
Instead of having the "extraction" pointer point to the DSA header,
it actually points to 4 bytes _inside_ the extraction header.
Corollary, the last 4 bytes of the "extraction" header are in fact 4
stale bytes of the destination MAC address from the Ethernet header,
from prior to the __skb_vlan_pop() movement.

So of course, RX timestamps are completely bogus when the system is
configured in this way.

The fix is actually very simple: just don't structure the code like that.
For better or worse, the DSA PTP timestamping API does not offer a
straightforward way for drivers to present their RX timestamps, but
other drivers (sja1105) have established a simple mechanism to carry
their RX timestamp from dsa_device_ops :: rcv() all the way to
dsa_switch_ops :: port_rxtstamp() and even later. That mechanism is to
simply save the partial timestamp to the skb->cb, and complete it later.

Question: why don't we simply populate the skb's struct
skb_shared_hwtstamps from ocelot_rcv(), and bother with this
complication of propagating the timestamp to felix_rxtstamp()?

Answer: dsa_switch_ops :: port_rxtstamp() answers the question whether
PTP packets need sleepable context to retrieve the full RX timestamp.
Currently felix_rxtstamp() answers "no, thanks" to that question, and
calls ocelot_ptp_gettime64() from softirq atomic context. This is
understandable, since Felix VSC9959 is a PCIe memory-mapped switch, so
hardware access does not require sleeping. But the felix driver is
preparing for the introduction of other switches where hardware access
is over a slow bus like SPI or MDIO:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210814025003.2449143-1-colin.foster@in-advantage.com/

So I would like to keep this code structure, so the rework needed when
that driver will need PTP support will be minimal (answer "yes, I need
deferred context for this skb's RX timestamp", then the partial
timestamp will still be found in the skb->cb.

Subject: i40e: use mul_u64_u64_div_u64 for PTP frequency calculation
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
Git-commit: 3626a690b717c18a969274e1fe000f8885d5afad
References: jsc#PED-372

The i40e device has a different clock rate depending on the current link
speed. This requires using a different increment rate for the PTP clock
registers. For slower link speeds, the base increment value is larger.
Directly multiplying the larger increment value by the parts per billion
adjustment might overflow.

To avoid this, the i40e implementation defaults to using the lower
increment value and then multiplying the adjustment afterwards. This causes
a loss of precision for lower link speeds.

We can fix this by using mul_u64_u64_div_u64 instead of performing the
multiplications using standard C operations. On X86, this will use special
instructions that perform the multiplication and division with 128bit
intermediate values. For other architectures, the fallback implementation
will limit the loss of precision for large values. Small adjustments don't
overflow anyways and won't lose precision at all.

This allows first multiplying the base increment value and then performing
the adjustment calculation, since we no longer fear overflowing. It also
makes it easier to convert to the even more precise .adjfine implementation
in a following change.

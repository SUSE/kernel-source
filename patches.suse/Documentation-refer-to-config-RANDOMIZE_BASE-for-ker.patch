Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: refer to config RANDOMIZE_BASE for kernel address-space randomization
Git-commit: 82ca67321f55a8d1da6ac3ed611da3c32818bb37
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

The config RANDOMIZE_SLAB does not exist, the authors probably intended to
refer to the config RANDOMIZE_BASE, which provides kernel address-space
randomization. They probably just confused SLAB with BASE (these two
four-letter words coincidentally share three common letters), as they also
point out the config SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM as further randomization within
the same sentence.

Fix the reference of the config for kernel address-space randomization to
the config that provides that.

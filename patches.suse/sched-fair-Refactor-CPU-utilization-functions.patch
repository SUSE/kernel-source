Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Refactor CPU utilization functions

References: bsc#1212887 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: 3eb6d6ececca2fd566d717b37ab467c246f66be7
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1

There is a lot of code duplication in cpu_util_next() & cpu_util_cfs().

Remove this by allowing cpu_util_next() to be called with p = NULL.
Rename cpu_util_next() to cpu_util() since the '_next' suffix is no
longer necessary to distinct cpu utilization related functions.
Implement cpu_util_cfs(cpu) as cpu_util(cpu, p = NULL, -1).

This will allow to code future related cpu util changes only in one
place, namely in cpu_util().

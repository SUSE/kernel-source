Subject: mptcp: blackhole only if 1st SYN retrans w/o MPC is accepted
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
Git-commit: e598d8981fd34470b78a1ae777dbf131b15d5bf2
References: git-fixes

The Fixes commit mentioned this:

> An MPTCP firewall blackhole can be detected if the following SYN
> retransmission after a fallback to "plain" TCP is accepted.

But in fact, this blackhole was detected if any following SYN
retransmissions after a fallback to TCP was accepted.

That's because 'mptcp_subflow_early_fallback()' will set 'request_mptcp'
to 0, and 'mpc_drop' will never be reset to 0 after.

This is an issue, because some not so unusual situations might cause the
kernel to detect a false-positive blackhole, e.g. a client trying to
connect to a server while the network is not ready yet, causing a few
SYN retransmissions, before reaching the end server.

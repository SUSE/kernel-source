Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: intel/sdw_utils: Add volume limit to cs42l43 speakers
Git-commit: 02b44a2b2bdcee03cbb92484d31e9ca1b91b2a38
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc5
References: stable-fixes

The volume control for cs42l43 speakers has a maximum gain of +31.5 dB.
However, for many use cases, this can cause distorted audio, depending
various factors, such as other signal-processing elements in the chain,
for example if the audio passes through a gain control before reaching
the codec or the signal path has been tuned for a particular maximum
gain in the codec.

In the case of systems which use the soc_sdw_cs42l43 driver, audio will
likely be distorted in all cases above 0 dB, therefore add a volume
limit of 128, which is 0 dB maximum volume inside this driver.

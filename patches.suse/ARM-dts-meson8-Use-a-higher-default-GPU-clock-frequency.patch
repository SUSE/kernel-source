Subject: ARM: dts: meson8: Use a higher default GPU clock frequency
Git-commit: 44cf630bcb8c5ec78125805c9447dd5766792224
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: git-fixes

We are seeing "imprecise external abort (0x1406)" errors during boot
(which then cause the whole board to hang) on Meson8 (but not Meson8m2).
These are observed while trying to access the GPU's registers when the
MALI clock is running at it's default setting of 24MHz. The 3.10 vendor
kernel uses 318.75MHz as "default" GPU frequency. Using that makes the
"imprecise external aborts" go away.
Add the assigned-clocks and assigned-clock-rates properties to also bump
the MALI clock to 318.75MHz before accessing any of it's registers.

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: keystone: Set mode as Root Complex for "ti,keystone-pcie" compatible

commit 23284ad677a9 ("PCI: keystone: Add support for PCIe EP in AM654x
Platforms") introduced configuring "enum dw_pcie_device_mode" as part of
device data ("struct ks_pcie_of_data"). However it failed to set the
mode for "ti,keystone-pcie" compatible.

Since the mode defaults to "DW_PCIE_UNKNOWN_TYPE", the following error
message is displayed for the v3.65a controller:

  "INVALID device type 0"

Despite the driver probing successfully, the controller may not be
functional in the Root Complex mode of operation.

So, set the mode as Root Complex for "ti,keystone-pcie" compatible to
fix this.

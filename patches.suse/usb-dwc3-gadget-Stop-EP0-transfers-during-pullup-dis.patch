Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Stop EP0 transfers during pullup disable
Git-commit: 4a1e25c0a029b97ea4a3d423a6392bfacc3b2e39
Patch-mainline: v5.14
References: git-fixes

During a USB cable disconnect, or soft disconnect scenario, a pending
SETUP transaction may not be completed, leading to the following
Error: 

    dwc3 a600000.dwc3: timed out waiting for SETUP phase

If this occurs, then the entire pullup disable routine is skipped and
proper cleanup and halting of the controller does not complete.

Instead of returning an error (which is ignored from the UDC
perspective), allow the pullup disable routine to continue, which
will also handle disabling of EP0/1.  This will end any active
transfers as well.  Ensure to clear any delayed_status also, as the
timeout could happen within the STATUS stage.

Fixes: bb0147364850 ("usb: dwc3: gadget: don't clear RUN/STOP when it's invalid to do so")

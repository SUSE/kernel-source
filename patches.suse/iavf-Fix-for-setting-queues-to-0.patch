Subject: iavf: Fix for setting queues to 0
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc2
Git-commit: 9a6e9e483a9684a34573fd9f9e30ecfb047cb8cb
References: jsc#SLE-18385

Now setting combine to 0 will be rejected with the
appropriate error code.
This has been implemented by adding a condition that checks
the value of combine equal to zero.
Without this patch, when the user requested it, no error was
returned and combine was set to the default value for VF.

Fixes: 5520deb15326 ("iavf: Enable support for up to 16 queues")

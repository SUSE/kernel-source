Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: exynos: correct s5k6a3 reset polarity on Midas family
Git-commit: 3ba2d4bb9592bf7a6a3fe3dbe711ecfc3d004bab
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

According to s5k6a3 driver code, the reset line for the chip appears to
be active low. This also matches the typical polarity of reset lines in
general. Let's fix it up as having correct polarity in DTS is important
when the driver will be switched over to gpiod API.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: intel_hdmi: Fix reference to PCM buffer address
Git-commit: 0aa6b294b312d9710804679abd2c0c8ca52cc2bc
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc7
References: git-fixes

PCM buffers might be allocated dynamically when the buffer
preallocation failed or a larger buffer is requested, and it's not
guaranteed that substream->dma_buffer points to the actually used
buffer.  The driver needs to refer to substream->runtime->dma_addr
instead for the buffer address.

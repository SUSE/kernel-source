Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci-spear: fix deferred probing
Git-commit: 8d0caeedcd05a721f3cc2537b0ea212ec4027307
Patch-mainline: v6.4
References: git-fixes

The driver overrides the error codes and IRQ0 returned by platform_get_irq()
to -EINVAL, so if it returns -EPROBE_DEFER, the driver will fail the probe
permanently instead of the deferred probing. Switch to propagating the error
codes upstream.  Since commit ce753ad1549c ("platform: finally disallow IRQ0
in platform_get_irq() and its ilk") IRQ0 is no longer returned by those APIs,
so we now can safely ignore it...

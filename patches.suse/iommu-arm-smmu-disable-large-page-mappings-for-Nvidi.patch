Subject: iommu: arm-smmu: disable large page mappings for Nvidia arm-smmu
Git-commit: 4a25f2ea0e030b2fc852c4059a50181bfc5b2f57
Patch-mainline: v5.18 or v5.18-rc6 (next release)
References: bsc#1198826

Tegra194 and Tegra234 SoCs have the erratum that causes walk cache
entries to not be invalidated correctly. The problem is that the walk
cache index generated for IOVA is not same across translation and
invalidation requests. This is leading to page faults when PMD entry is
released during unmap and populated with new PTE table during subsequent
map request. Disabling large page mappings avoids the release of PMD
entry and avoid translations seeing stale PMD entry in walk cache.
Fix this by limiting the page mappings to PAGE_SIZE for Tegra194 and
Tegra234 devices. This is recommended fix from Tegra hardware design
team.

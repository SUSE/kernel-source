Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/rw: don't allow multishot reads without NOWAIT
 support
Git-commit: 2a975d426c82ff05ec1f0b773798d909fe4a3105
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc3
References: git-fixes

Supporting multishot reads requires support for NOWAIT, as the
alternative would be always having io-wq execute the work item whenever
the poll readiness triggered. Any fast file type will have NOWAIT
support (eg it understands both O_NONBLOCK and IOCB_NOWAIT). If the
given file type does not, then simply resort to single shot execution.

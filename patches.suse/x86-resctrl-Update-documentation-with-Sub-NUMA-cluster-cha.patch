Subject: x86/resctrl: Update documentation with Sub-NUMA cluster changes
Git-commit: ea34999f41873c96ac89e861e5fdfc7d0403f9e3
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: jsc#PED-10246

With Sub-NUMA Cluster (SNC) mode enabled, the scope of monitoring resources
is per-NODE instead of per-L3 cache. Backwards compatibility is maintained
by providing files in the mon_L3_XX directories that sum event counts
for all SNC nodes sharing an L3 cache.

New files provide per-SNC node event counts.

Users should be aware that SNC mode also affects the amount of L3 cache
available for allocation within each SNC node.

+Notes on Sub-NUMA Cluster mode
+==============================
+When SNC mode is enabled, Linux may load balance tasks between Sub-NUMA
+nodes much more readily than between regular NUMA nodes since the CPUs
+on Sub-NUMA nodes share the same L3 cache and the system may report
+the NUMA distance between Sub-NUMA nodes with a lower value than used
+for regular NUMA nodes.
+
+The top-level monitoring files in each "mon_L3_XX" directory provide
+the sum of data across all SNC nodes sharing an L3 cache instance.
+Users who bind tasks to the CPUs of a specific Sub-NUMA node can read
+the "llc_occupancy", "mbm_total_bytes", and "mbm_local_bytes" in the
+"mon_sub_L3_YY" directories to get node local data.
+
+Memory bandwidth allocation is still performed at the L3 cache
+level. I.e. throttling controls are applied to all SNC nodes.
+
+L3 cache allocation bitmaps also apply to all SNC nodes. But note that
+the amount of L3 cache represented by each bit is divided by the number
+of SNC nodes per L3 cache. E.g. with a 100MB cache on a system with 10-bit
+allocation masks each bit normally represents 10MB. With SNC mode enabled
+with two SNC nodes per L3 cache, each bit only represents 5MB.

Subject: scsi: Do not attempt to rescan suspended devices
Git-commit: ff48b37802e5c134e2dfc4d091f10b2eb5065a72
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc4
References: git-fixes

scsi_rescan_device() takes a scsi device lock before executing a device
handler and device driver rescan methods. Waiting for the completion of
any command issued to the device by these methods will thus be done with
the device lock held. As a result, there is a risk of deadlocking within
the power management code if scsi_rescan_device() is called to handle a
device resume with the associated scsi device not yet resumed.

Avoid such situation by checking that the target scsi device is in the
running state, that is, fully capable of executing commands, before
proceeding with the rescan and bailout returning -EWOULDBLOCK otherwise.
With this error return, the caller can retry rescaning the device after
a delay.

The state check is done with the device lock held and is thus safe
against incoming suspend power management operations.

[lduncan: refreshed after applying with fuzz]

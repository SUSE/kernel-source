Subject: unroll: add generic loop unroll helpers
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
Git-commit: c6594d64271704b335378e7b74c39fe4d4fcc777
References: jsc#PED-14404 jsc#PED-15079

There are cases when we need to explicitly unroll loops. For example,
cache operations, filling DMA descriptors on very high speeds etc.
Add compiler-specific attribute macros to give the compiler a hint
that we'd like to unroll a loop.
Example usage:

 #define UNROLL_BATCH 8

	unrolled_count(UNROLL_BATCH)
	for (u32 i = 0; i < UNROLL_BATCH; i++)
		op(priv, i);

Note that sometimes the compilers won't unroll loops if they think this
would have worse optimization and perf than without unrolling, and that
unroll attributes are available only starting GCC 8. For older compiler
versions, no hints/attributes will be applied.
For better unrolling/parallelization, don't have any variables that
interfere between iterations except for the iterator itself.

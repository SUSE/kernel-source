Subject: bpf: Pack struct bpf_fib_lookup
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
Git-commit: f91717007217d975aa975ddabd91ae1a107b9bff
References: jsc#PED-11651

The struct bpf_fib_lookup is supposed to be of size 64. A recent commit
59b418c7063d ("bpf: Add a check for struct bpf_fib_lookup size") added
a static assertion to check this property so that future changes to the
structure will not accidentally break this assumption.

As it immediately turned out, on some 32-bit arm systems, when AEABI=n,
the total size of the structure was equal to 68, see [1]. This happened
because the bpf_fib_lookup structure contains a union of two 16-bit
fields:

    union {
            __u16 tot_len;
            __u16 mtu_result;
    };

which was supposed to compile to a 16-bit-aligned 16-bit field. On the
aforementioned setups it was instead both aligned and padded to 32-bits.

Declare this inner union as __attribute__((packed, aligned(2))) such
that it always is of size 2 and is aligned to 16 bits.

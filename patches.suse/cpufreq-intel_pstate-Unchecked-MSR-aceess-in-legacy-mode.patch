Subject: cpufreq: intel_pstate: Unchecked MSR aceess in legacy mode
References: git-fixes
Patch-Mainline: v6.15-rc5
Git-commit: ac4e04d9e378f5aa826c2406ad7871ae1b6a6fb9


When turbo mode is unavailable on a Skylake-X system, executing the
command:

 # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo

results in an unchecked MSR access error:

 WRMSR to 0x199 (attempted to write 0x0000000100001300).

This issue was reproduced on an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)
system and is not a common problem across all Skylake-X systems.

This error occurs because the MSR 0x199 Turbo Engage Bit (bit 32) is set
when turbo mode is disabled. The issue arises when intel_pstate fails to
detect that turbo mode is disabled. Here intel_pstate relies on
MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE bit 38 to determine the status of turbo mode.
However, on this system, bit 38 is not set even when turbo mode is
disabled.

According to the Intel Software Developer's Manual (SDM), the BIOS sets
this bit during platform initialization to enable or disable
opportunistic processor performance operations. Logically, this bit
should be set in such cases. However, the SDM also specifies that "OS
and applications must use CPUID leaf 06H to detect processors with
opportunistic processor performance operations enabled."

Therefore, in addition to checking MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE bit 38, verify
that CPUID.06H:EAX[1] is 0 to accurately determine if turbo mode is
disabled.

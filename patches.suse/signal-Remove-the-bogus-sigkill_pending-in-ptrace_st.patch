Subject: [PATCH] signal: Remove the bogus sigkill_pending in ptrace_stop
Git-commit: 7d613f9f72ec8f90ddefcae038fdae5adb8404b3
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: stable-5.14.19

commit 7d613f9f72ec8f90ddefcae038fdae5adb8404b3 upstream.

The existence of sigkill_pending is a little silly as it is
functionally a duplicate of fatal_signal_pending that is used in
exactly one place.

Checking for pending fatal signals and returning early in ptrace_stop
is actively harmful.  It casues the ptrace_stop called by
ptrace_signal to return early before setting current->exit_code.
Later when ptrace_signal reads the signal number from
current->exit_code is undefined, making it unpredictable what will
happen.

Instead rely on the fact that schedule will not sleep if there is a
pending signal that can awaken a task.

Removing the explict sigkill_pending test fixes fixes ptrace_signal
when ptrace_stop does not stop because current->exit_code is always
set to to signr.

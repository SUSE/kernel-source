Subject: [PATCH] watchdog: sp5100_tco: Immediately trigger upon starting.
Git-commit: 4eda19cc8a29cde3580ed73bf11dc73b4e757697
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

The watchdog countdown is supposed to begin when the device file is
opened. Instead, it would begin countdown upon the first write to or
close of the device file. Now, the ping operation is called within the
start operation which ensures the countdown begins. From experimenation,
it does not appear possible to do this with a single write including
both the start bit and the trigger bit. So, it is done as two distinct
writes.

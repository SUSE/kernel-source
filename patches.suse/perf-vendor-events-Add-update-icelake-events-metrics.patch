Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: perf-sp7-v6.11-userspace-update

Update events from v1.21 to v1.22.
Add TMA metrics v4.8.

Bring in the event updates v1.22:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/e5640646e96d59e3c1c1e0d0100a475220ff1dfe

The TMA 4.8 information was added in:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/59194d4d90ca50a3fcb2de0d82b9f6fc0c9a5736

Adds the event SW_PREFETCH_ACCESS.ANY.

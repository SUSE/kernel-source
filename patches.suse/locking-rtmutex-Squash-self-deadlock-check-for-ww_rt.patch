Subject: [PATCH] locking/rtmutex: Squash self-deadlock check for ww_rt_mutex.
Git-commit: 02ea9fc96fe976e7f7e067f38b12202f126e3f2f
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsc#1190137 bsc#1189998

Similar to the issues in commits:

  6467822b8cc9 ("locking/rtmutex: Prevent spurious EDEADLK return caused by ww_mutexes")
  a055fcc132d4 ("locking/rtmutex: Return success on deadlock for ww_mutex waiters")

ww_rt_mutex_lock() should not return EDEADLK without first going through
the __ww_mutex logic to set the required state. In fact, the chain-walk
can deal with the spurious cycles (per the above commits) this check
warns about and is trying to avoid.

Therefore ignore this test for ww_rt_mutex and simply let things fall
in place.

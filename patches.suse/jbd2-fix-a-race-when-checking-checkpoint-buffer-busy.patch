Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: fix a race when checking checkpoint buffer busy
Git-commit: 46f881b5b1758dc4a35fba4a643c10717d0cf427
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc3
References: bsc#1214949

Before removing checkpoint buffer from the t_checkpoint_list, we have to
check both BH_Dirty and BH_Lock bits together to distinguish buffers
have not been or were being written back. But __cp_buffer_busy() checks
them separately, it first check lock state and then check dirty, the
window between these two checks could be raced by writing back
procedure, which locks buffer and clears buffer dirty before I/O
completes. So it cannot guarantee checkpointing buffers been written
back to disk if some error happens later. Finally, it may clean
checkpoint transactions and lead to inconsistent filesystem.

jbd2_journal_forget() and __journal_try_to_free_buffer() also have the
same problem (journal_unmap_buffer() escape from this issue since it's
running under the buffer lock), so fix them through introducing a new
helper to try holding the buffer lock and remove really clean buffer.

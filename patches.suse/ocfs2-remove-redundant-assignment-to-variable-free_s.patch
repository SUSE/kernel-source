Subject: [PATCH] ocfs2: remove redundant assignment to variable free_space
Git-commit: 9a25d051502ca1f19af3fd8e196c408a4a9c9fbb
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsc#1228409

The variable 'free_space' is being initialized with a value that is not
read, it is being re-assigned later in the two paths of an if statement.
The early initialization is redundant and can be removed.

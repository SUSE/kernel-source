Subject: fbdev: Disable sysfb device registration when removing conflicting
 FBs
Git-commit: 873eb3b11860aada97ddc02d48b54522b92848db
Git-repo: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm.git
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: boo#1193472

The platform devices registered by sysfb match with firmware-based DRM or
fbdev drivers, that are used to have early graphics using a framebuffer
provided by the system firmware.

DRM or fbdev drivers later are probed and remove conflicting framebuffers,
leading to these platform devices for generic drivers to be unregistered.

But the current solution has a race, since the sysfb_init() function could
be called after a DRM or fbdev driver is probed and request to unregister
the devices for drivers with conflicting framebuffes.

To prevent this, disable any future sysfb platform device registration by
calling sysfb_disable(), if a driver requests to remove the conflicting
framebuffers.

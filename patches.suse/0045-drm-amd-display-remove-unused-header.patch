Subject: drm/amd/display: remove unused header
Git-commit: f9bc6142cd8deb953f0d9fa6bc6e1833402739e4
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225 jsc#PED-2849

dml_wrapper* files were removed in commit 01b537eeb049
("drm/amd/display: Remove unused code"), as they are not used anywhere.
However, the header file wasn't removed, so remove the header as well.

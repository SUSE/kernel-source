Subject: loop: don't set QUEUE_FLAG_NOMERGES
Git-commit: 667ea36378cf7f669044b27871c496e1559c872a
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

QUEUE_FLAG_NOMERGES isn't really a driver interface, but a user tunable.
There also isn't any good reason to set it in the loop driver.

The original commit adding it (5b5e20f421c0b6d "block: loop: set
QUEUE_FLAG_NOMERGES for request queue of loop") claims that "It doesn't
make sense to enable merge because the I/O submitted to backing file is
handled page by page."  which of course isn't true for multi-page bvec
now, and it never has been for direct I/O, for which commit 40326d8a33d
("block/loop: allow request merge for directio mode") alredy disabled
the nomerges flag.

Subject: [PATCH] sbitmap: fix possible io hung due to lost wakeup
Git-commit: 040b83fcecfb86f3225d3a5de7fd9b3fbccf83b4
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc1
References: git-fixes

There are two problems can lead to lost wakeup:

1) invalid wakeup on the wrong waitqueue:

For example, 2 * wake_batch tags are put, while only wake_batch threads
are woken:

__sbq_wake_up
 atomic_cmpxchg -> reset wait_cnt
			__sbq_wake_up -> decrease wait_cnt
			...
			__sbq_wake_up -> wait_cnt is decreased to 0 again
			 atomic_cmpxchg
			 sbq_index_atomic_inc -> increase wake_index
			 wake_up_nr -> wake up and waitqueue might be empty
 sbq_index_atomic_inc -> increase again, one waitqueue is skipped
 wake_up_nr -> invalid wake up because old wakequeue might be empty

To fix the problem, increasing 'wake_index' before resetting 'wait_cnt'.

2) 'wait_cnt' can be decreased while waitqueue is empty

As pointed out by Jan Kara, following race is possible:

CPU1				CPU2
__sbq_wake_up			 __sbq_wake_up
 sbq_wake_ptr()			 sbq_wake_ptr() -> the same
 wait_cnt = atomic_dec_return()
 /* decreased to 0 */
 sbq_index_atomic_inc()
 /* move to next waitqueue */
 atomic_set()
 /* reset wait_cnt */
 wake_up_nr()
 /* wake up on the old waitqueue */
				 wait_cnt = atomic_dec_return()
				 /*
				  * decrease wait_cnt in the old
				  * waitqueue, while it can be
				  * empty.
				  */

Fix the problem by waking up before updating 'wake_index' and
'wait_cnt'.

With this patch, noted that 'wait_cnt' is still decreased in the old
empty waitqueue, however, the wakeup is redirected to a active waitqueue,
and the extra decrement on the old empty waitqueue is not handled.

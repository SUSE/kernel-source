Subject: x86: Handle idle=nomwait cmdline properly for x86_idle
Git-commit: 8bcedb4ce04750e1ccc9a6b6433387f6a9166a56
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: bsc#1208619

When kernel is booted with idle=nomwait do not use MWAIT as the
default idle state.

If the user boots the kernel with idle=nomwait, it is a clear
direction to not use mwait as the default idle state.
However, the current code does not take this into consideration
while selecting the default idle state on x86.

Fix it by checking for the idle=nomwait boot option in
prefer_mwait_c1_over_halt().

Also update the documentation around idle=nomwait appropriately.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests: forwarding: Switch off timeout
Git-commit: 0529883ad102f6c04e19fb7018f31e1bda575bbe
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc6
References: git-fixes

The default timeout for selftests is 45 seconds, but it is not enough
for forwarding selftests which can takes minutes to finish depending on
the number of tests cases:

 # make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=net/forwarding run_tests
 TAP version 13
 1..102
 # timeout set to 45
 # selftests: net/forwarding: bridge_igmp.sh
 # TEST: IGMPv2 report 239.10.10.10                                    [ OK ]
 # TEST: IGMPv2 leave 239.10.10.10                                     [ OK ]
 # TEST: IGMPv3 report 239.10.10.10 is_include                         [ OK ]
 # TEST: IGMPv3 report 239.10.10.10 include -> allow                   [ OK ]
 #
 not ok 1 selftests: net/forwarding: bridge_igmp.sh # TIMEOUT 45 seconds

Fix by switching off the timeout and setting it to 0. A similar change
was done for BPF selftests in commit 6fc5916cc256 ("selftests: bpf:
Switch off timeout").

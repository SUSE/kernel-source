Subject: [PATCH] cifs: reconnect helper should set reconnect for the right
 channel
Git-commit: c3326a61cdbf3ce1273d9198b6cbf90965d7e029
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1

We introduced a helper function to be used by non-cifsd threads to
mark the connection for reconnect. For multichannel, when only
a particular channel needs to be reconnected, this had a bug.

This change fixes that by marking that particular channel
for reconnect.

Fixes: dca65818c80c ("cifs: use a different reconnect helper for non-cifsd threads")

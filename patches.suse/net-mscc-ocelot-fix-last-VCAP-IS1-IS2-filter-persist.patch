Subject: [PATCH 14/34] net: mscc: ocelot: fix last VCAP IS1/IS2 filter
 persisting in hardware when deleted
Git-commit: 16bbebd35629c93a8c68c6d8d28557e100bcee73
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc7
References: git-fixes

ocelot_vcap_filter_del() works by moving the next filters over the
current one, and then deleting the last filter by calling vcap_entry_set()
with a del_filter which was specially created by memsetting its memory
to zeroes. vcap_entry_set() then programs this to the TCAM and action
RAM via the cache registers.

The problem is that vcap_entry_set() is a dispatch function which looks
at del_filter->block_id. But since del_filter is zeroized memory, the
block_id is 0, or otherwise said, VCAP_ES0. So practically, what we do
is delete the entry at the same TCAM index from VCAP ES0 instead of IS1
or IS2.

The code was not always like this. vcap_entry_set() used to simply be
is2_entry_set(), and then, the logic used to work.

Restore the functionality by populating the block_id of the del_filter
based on the VCAP block of the filter that we're deleting. This makes
vcap_entry_set() know what to do.

Subject: ring-buffer: Include dropped pages in counting dirty patches
Git-commit: 31029a8b2c7e656a0289194ef16415050ae4c4ac
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc6
References: git-fixes

The function ring_buffer_nr_dirty_pages() was created to find out how many
pages are filled in the ring buffer. There's two running counters. One is
incremented whenever a new page is touched (pages_touched) and the other
is whenever a page is read (pages_read). The dirty count is the number
touched minus the number read. This is used to determine if a blocked task
should be woken up if the percentage of the ring buffer it is waiting for
is hit.

The problem is that it does not take into account dropped pages (when the
new writes overwrite pages that were not read). And then the dirty pages
will always be greater than the percentage.

This makes the "buffer_percent" file inaccurate, as the number of dirty
pages end up always being larger than the percentage, event when it's not
and this causes user space to be woken up more than it wants to be.

Add a new counter to keep track of lost pages, and include that in the
accounting of dirty pages so that it is actually accurate.

Subject: padding for extending cgroup controllers
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE-specific
References: jsc#PED-8461

struct cgroup_subsys_state is embedded in every controller's struct, so it is
ideal place for a KABI padding in case an individual controller needed an
extension. It is also embedded in struct cgroup (self), so it is useful
extension point for cgroup proper.

Memory footprint impact should be small as we're adding a single pointer to
relatively large structures, ideally it would be zero since those structs fit
sufficiently to power-of-2 SLAB cache. (Data needed.)

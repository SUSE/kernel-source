Subject: [PATCH] console: Improve console_srcu_read_flags() comments

References: bsc#1232534 (PREEMPT_RT prerequisite backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
Git-commit: dc219d8d858d95549543aa7a41b6e64a0da9e406

It was not clear when exactly console_srcu_read_flags() must be
used vs. directly reading @console->flags.

Refactor and clarify that console_srcu_read_flags() is only
needed if the console is registered or the caller is in a
context where the registration status of the console may change
(due to another context).

The function requires the caller holds @console_srcu, which will
ensure that the caller sees an appropriate @flags value for the
registered console and that exit/cleanup routines will not run
if the console is in the process of unregistration.

+ * Requires console_srcu_read_lock to be held, which implies that @con might
+ * be a registered console. The purpose of holding console_srcu_read_lock is
+ * to guarantee that the console state is valid (CON_SUSPENDED/CON_ENABLED)
+ * and that no exit/cleanup routines will run if the console is currently
+ * undergoing unregistration.
+ *
+ * If the caller is holding the console_list_lock or it is _certain_ that
+ * @con is not and will not become registered, the caller may read
+ * @con->flags directly instead.
  *
  * Context: Any context.
+ * Return: The current value of the @con->flags field.

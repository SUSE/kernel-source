Subject: dm-table: Set BLK_FEAT_ATOMIC_WRITES for target queue limits
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
Git-commit: b7c18b17a173087ce97e809cefd55e581121f19e
References: git-fixes

Feature flag BLK_FEAT_ATOMIC_WRITES is not being properly set for the
target queue limits, and this means that atomic writes are not being
enabled for any dm personalities.

When calling dm_set_device_limits() -> blk_stack_limits() ->
... -> blk_stack_atomic_writes_limits(), the bottom device limits
(which corresponds to intermediate target queue limits) does not have
BLK_FEAT_ATOMIC_WRITES set, and so atomic writes can never be enabled.

Typically such a flag would be inherited from the stacked device in
dm_set_device_limits() -> blk_stack_limits() via BLK_FEAT_INHERIT_MASK,
but BLK_FEAT_ATOMIC_WRITES is not inherited as it's preferred to manually
enable on a per-personality basis.

Set BLK_FEAT_ATOMIC_WRITES manually for the intermediate target queue
limits from the stacked device to get atomic writes working.

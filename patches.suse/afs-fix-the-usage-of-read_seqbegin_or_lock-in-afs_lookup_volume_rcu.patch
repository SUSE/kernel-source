Subject: [PATCH] afs: fix the usage of read_seqbegin_or_lock() in
 afs_lookup_volume_rcu()
Git-commit: 4121b4337146b64560d1e46ebec77196d9287802
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

David Howells says:

 (2) afs_lookup_volume_rcu().

     There can be a lot of volumes known by a system.  A thousand would
     require a 10-step walk and this is drivable by remote operation, so I
     think this should probably take a lock on the second pass too.

Make the "seq" counter odd on the 2nd pass, otherwise read_seqbegin_or_lock()
never takes the lock.

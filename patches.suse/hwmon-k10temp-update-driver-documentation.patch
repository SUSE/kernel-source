 Models from 17h family report relative temperature, the driver aims to
 compensate and report the real temperature.

+On Family 17h and Family 18h CPUs, additional temperature sensors may report
+Core Complex Die (CCD) temperatures. Up to 8 such temperatures are reported
+as temp{3..10}_input, labeled Tccd{1..8}. Actual support depends on the CPU

+Various Family 17h and 18h CPUs report voltage and current telemetry

+in1_input	Vsoc	SoC voltage
+curr1_input	Icore	Core current
+curr2_input	Isoc	SoC current
+===============	=======	================

+Current values are raw (unscaled) as reported by the CPU. Core current is
+reported as multiples of 1A / LSB. SoC is reported as multiples of 0.25A
+/ LSB. The real current is board specific. Reported currents should be seen
+as rough guidance, and should be scaled using sensors3.conf as appropriate
+for a given board.

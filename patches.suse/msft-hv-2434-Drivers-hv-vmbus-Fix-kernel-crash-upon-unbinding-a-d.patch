Subject: Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix kernel crash upon unbinding a device from uio_hv_generic driver
Git-commit: f1940d4e9cbe6208e7e77e433c587af108152a17
References: git-fixes

The following crash happens when a never-used device is unbound from
uio_hv_generic driver:

The problem appears to be that we free 'ring_info->pkt_buffer' twice:
first, when the device is unbound from in-kernel driver (netvsc in this
case) and second from hv_uio_remove(). Normally, ring buffer is supposed
to be re-initialized from hv_uio_open() but this happens when UIO device
is being opened and this is not guaranteed to happen.

Generally, it is OK to call hv_ringbuffer_cleanup() twice for the same
channel (which is being handed over between in-kernel drivers and UIO) even
if we didn't call hv_ringbuffer_init() in between. We, however, need to
avoid kfree() call for an already freed pointer.

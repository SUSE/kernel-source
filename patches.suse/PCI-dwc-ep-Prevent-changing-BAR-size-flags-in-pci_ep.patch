Subject: PCI: dwc: ep: Prevent changing BAR size/flags in pci_epc_set_bar()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

References: git-fixes CVE-2024-58006 bsc#1238772
Git-commit: 3708acbd5f169ebafe1faa519cb28adc56295546
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1

In commit 4284c88fff0e ("PCI: designware-ep: Allow pci_epc_set_bar() update
inbound map address") set_bar() was modified to support dynamically
changing the backing physical address of a BAR that was already configured.

This means that set_bar() can be called twice, without ever calling
clear_bar() (as calling clear_bar() would clear the BAR's PCI address
assigned by the host).

This can only be done if the new BAR size/flags does not differ from the
existing BAR configuration. Add these missing checks.

If we allow set_bar() to set e.g. a new BAR size that differs from the
existing BAR size, the new address translation range will be smaller than
the BAR size already determined by the host, which would mean that a read
past the new BAR size would pass the iATU untranslated, which could allow
the host to read memory not belonging to the new struct pci_epf_bar.

While at it, add comments which clarifies the support for dynamically
changing the physical address of a BAR. (Which was also missing.)

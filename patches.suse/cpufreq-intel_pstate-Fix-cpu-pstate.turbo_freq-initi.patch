Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix cpu->pstate.turbo_freq initialization
Git-commit: c72bcf0ab87a92634e58af62e89af0f40dfd0b88
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes bsc#1212526 bsc#1214368 jsc#PED-4927 jsc#PED-4929

Fix a problem in active mode that cpu->pstate.turbo_freq is initialized
only if HWP-to-frequency scaling factor is refined.

In passive mode, this problem is not exposed, because
cpu->pstate.turbo_freq is set again, later in
intel_cpufreq_cpu_init()->intel_pstate_get_hwp_cap().

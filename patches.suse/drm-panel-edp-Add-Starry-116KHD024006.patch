Subject: drm/panel-edp: Add Starry 116KHD024006

We have a few reports of sc7180-trogdor-pompom devices that have a
panel in them that IDs as STA 0x0004 and has the following raw EDID:

  00 ff ff ff ff ff ff 00  4e 81 04 00 00 00 00 00
  10 20 01 04 a5 1a 0e 78  0a dc dd 96 5b 5b 91 28
  1f 52 54 00 00 00 01 01  01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01
  01 01 01 01 01 01 8e 1c  56 a0 50 00 1e 30 28 20
  55 00 00 90 10 00 00 18  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 fe
  00 31 31 36 4b 48 44 30  32 34 30 30 36 0a 00 e6

We've been unable to locate a datasheet for this panel and our partner
has not been responsive, but all Starry eDP datasheets that we can
find agree on the same timing (delay_100_500_e200) so it should be
safe to use that here instead of the super conservative timings. We'll
still go a little extra conservative and allow `hpd_absent` of 200
instead of 100 because that won't add any real-world delay in most
cases.

We'll associate the string from the EDID ("116KHD024006") with this
panel. Given that the ID is the suspicious value of 0x0004 it seems
likely that Starry doesn't always update their IDs but the string will
still work to differentiate if we ever need to in the future.

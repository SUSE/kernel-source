Subject: [PATCH] ext4: Detect already used quota file early
Git-commit: e0770e91424f694b461141cbc99adf6b23006b60
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: bsc#1206873

When we try to use file already used as a quota file again (for the same
or different quota type), strange things can happen. At the very least
lockdep annotations may be wrong but also inode flags may be wrongly set
/ reset. When the file is used for two quota types at once we can even
corrupt the file and likely crash the kernel. Catch all these cases by
checking whether passed file is already used as quota file and bail
early in that case.

This fixes occasional generic/219 failure due to lockdep complaint.

Subject: cdx: Explicitly include correct DT includes
Git-commit: a436194d0ee94ec67522647ace5a36a2126b6a0e
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: jsc#PED-10968

The DT of_device.h and of_platform.h date back to the separate
of_platform_bus_type before it as merged into the regular platform bus.
As part of that merge prepping Arm DT support 13 years ago, they
"temporarily" include each other. They also include platform_device.h
and of.h. As a result, there's a pretty much random mix of those include
files used throughout the tree. In order to detangle these headers and
replace the implicit includes with struct declarations, users need to
explicitly include the correct includes.

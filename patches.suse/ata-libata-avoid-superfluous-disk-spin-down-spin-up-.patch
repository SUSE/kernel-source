Subject: [PATCH] ata: libata: avoid superfluous disk spin down + spin up during hibernation
Git-commit: a38719e3157118428e34fbd45b0d0707a5877784
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc3
References: git-fixes

A user reported that commit aa3998dbeb3a ("ata: libata-scsi: Disable scsi
device manage_system_start_stop") introduced a spin down + immediate spin
up of the disk both when entering and when resuming from hibernation.
This behavior was not there before, and causes an increased latency both
when entering and when resuming from hibernation.

Hibernation is done by three consecutive PM events, in the following order:
1) PM_EVENT_FREEZE
2) PM_EVENT_THAW
3) PM_EVENT_HIBERNATE

Commit aa3998dbeb3a ("ata: libata-scsi: Disable scsi device
manage_system_start_stop") modified ata_eh_handle_port_suspend() to call
ata_dev_power_set_standby() (which spins down the disk), for both event
PM_EVENT_FREEZE and event PM_EVENT_HIBERNATE.

Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst, section "Entering Hibernation",
explicitly mentions that PM_EVENT_FREEZE does not have to be put the device
in a low-power state, and actually recommends not doing so. Thus, let's not
spin down the disk on PM_EVENT_FREEZE. (The disk will instead be spun down
during the subsequent PM_EVENT_HIBERNATE event.)

This way, PM_EVENT_FREEZE will behave as it did before commit aa3998dbeb3a
("ata: libata-scsi: Disable scsi device manage_system_start_stop"), while
PM_EVENT_HIBERNATE will continue to spin down the disk.

This will avoid the superfluous spin down + spin up when entering and
resuming from hibernation, while still making sure that the disk is spun
down before actually entering hibernation.

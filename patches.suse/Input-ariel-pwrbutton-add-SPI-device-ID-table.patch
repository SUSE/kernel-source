Subject: [PATCH] Input: ariel-pwrbutton - add SPI device ID table
Git-commit: 5c4c2c8e6fac26fa0b80c234d6e9f75d637193af
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes stable-5.14.19

Currently autoloading for SPI devices does not use the DT ID table, it uses
SPI modalises. Supporting OF modalises is going to be difficult if not
impractical, an attempt was made but has been reverted, so ensure that
module autoloading works for this driver by adding a SPI device ID table.

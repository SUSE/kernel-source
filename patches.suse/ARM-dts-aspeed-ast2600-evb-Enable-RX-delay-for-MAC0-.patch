Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed: ast2600-evb: Enable RX delay for MAC0/MAC1
Git-commit: 4d338ee40ba89e508c5d3e1b4af956af7cb5e12e
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Since mac0/1 and mac2/3 are physically located on different die,
they have different properties by nature, which is mac0/1 has smaller delay step.

The property 'phy-mode' on ast2600 mac0 and mac1 is recommended to set to 'rgmii-rxid'
which enables the RX interface delay from the PHY chip.

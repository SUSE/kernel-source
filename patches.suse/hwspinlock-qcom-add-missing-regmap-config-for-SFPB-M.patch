Subject: [PATCH] hwspinlock: qcom: add missing regmap config for SFPB MMIO implementation
Git-commit: 23316be8a9d450f33a21f1efe7d89570becbec58
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1
References: git-fixes

Commit 5d4753f741d8 ("hwspinlock: qcom: add support for MMIO on older
SoCs") introduced and made regmap_config mandatory in the of_data struct
but didn't add the regmap_config for sfpb based devices.

SFPB based devices can both use the legacy syscon way to probe or the
new MMIO way and currently device that use the MMIO way are broken as
they lack the definition of the now required regmap_config and always
return -EINVAL (and indirectly makes fail probing everything that
depends on it, smem, nandc with smem-parser...)

Fix this by correctly adding the missing regmap_config and restore
function of hwspinlock on SFPB based devices with MMIO implementation.

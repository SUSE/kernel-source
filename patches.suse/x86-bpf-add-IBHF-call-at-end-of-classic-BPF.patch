Subject: [PATCH v6 2/3] x86/bpf: Add IBHF call at end of classic BPF
Patch-mainline: never, embargo
References: bsc#1242778

From: Daniel Sneddon <daniel.sneddon@linux.intel.com>

Classic BPF programs can be run by unprivileged users, allowing
unprivileged code to execute inside the kernel. Attackers can use this to
craft branch history in kernel mode that can influence the target of
indirect branches.

BHI_DIS_S provides user-kernel isolation of branch history, but cBPF can be
used to bypass this protection by crafting branch history in kernel mode.
To stop intra-mode attacks via cBPF programs, Intel created a new
instruction Indirect Branch History Fence (IBHF). IBHF prevents the
predicted targets of subsequent indirect branches from being influenced by
branch history prior to the IBHF. IBHF is only effective while BHI_DIS_S is
enabled.

Add the IBHF instruction to cBPF jitted code's exit path. Add the new fence
when the hardware mitigation is enabled (i.e., X86_FEATURE_CLEAR_BHB_HW is
set) or after the software sequence (X86_FEATURE_CLEAR_BHB_LOOP) is being
used in a virtual machine. Note that X86_FEATURE_CLEAR_BHB_HW and
X86_FEATURE_CLEAR_BHB_LOOP are mutually exclusive, so the JIT compiler will
only emit the new fence, not the SW sequence, when X86_FEATURE_CLEAR_BHB_HW
is set.

Hardware that enumerates BHI_NO basically has BHI_DIS_S protections always
enabled, regardless of the value of BHI_DIS_S. Since BHI_DIS_S doesn't
protect against intra-mode attacks, enumerate BHI bug on BHI_NO hardware as
well.

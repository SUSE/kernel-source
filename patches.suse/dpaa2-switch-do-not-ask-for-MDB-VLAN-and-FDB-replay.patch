Subject: [PATCH 17/17] dpaa2-switch: do not ask for MDB, VLAN and FDB replay
Git-commit: f24a49a375f65e8e75ee1b19d806f46dbaae57fd
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc6
References: git-fixes

Starting with commit 4e51bf44a03a ("net: bridge: move the switchdev
object replay helpers to "push" mode") the switchdev_bridge_port_offload()
helper was extended with the intention to provide switchdev drivers easy
access to object addition and deletion replays. This works by calling
the replay helpers with non-NULL notifier blocks.

In the same commit, the dpaa2-switch driver was updated so that it
passes valid notifier blocks to the helper. At that moment, no
regression was identified through testing.

In the meantime, the blamed commit changed the behavior in terms of
which ports get hit by the replay. Before this commit, only the initial
port which identified itself as offloaded through
switchdev_bridge_port_offload() got a replay of all port objects and
FDBs. After this, the newly joining port will trigger a replay of
objects on all bridge ports and on the bridge itself.

This behavior leads to errors in dpaa2_switch_port_vlans_add() when a
VLAN gets installed on the same interface multiple times.

The intended mechanism to address this is to pass a non-NULL ctx to the
switchdev_bridge_port_offload() helper and then check it against the
port's private structure. But since the driver does not have any use for
the replayed port objects and FDBs until it gains support for LAG
offload, it's better to fix the issue by reverting the dpaa2-switch
driver to not ask for replay. The pointers will be added back when we
are prepared to ignore replays on unrelated ports.

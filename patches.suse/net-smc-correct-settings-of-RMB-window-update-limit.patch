Subject: net/smc: correct settings of RMB window update limit
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
Git-commit: 6bf536eb5c8ca011d1ff57b5c5f7c57ceac06a37
References: jsc#PED-612

rmbe_update_limit is used to limit announcing receive
window updating too frequently. RFC7609 request a minimal
increase in the window size of 10% of the receive buffer
space. But current implementation used:

  min_t(int, rmbe_size / 10, SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2)

and SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2 == 2304 Bytes, which is almost
always less then 10% of the receive buffer space.

This causes the receiver always sending CDC message to
update its consumer cursor when it consumes more then 2K
of data. And as a result, we may encounter something like
"TCP silly window syndrome" when sending 2.5~8K message.

This patch fixes this using max(rmbe_size / 10, SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2).

With this patch and SMC autocorking enabled, qperf 2K/4K/8K
tcp_bw test shows 45%/75%/40% increase in throughput respectively.

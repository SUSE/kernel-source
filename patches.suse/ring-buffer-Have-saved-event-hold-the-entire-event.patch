Subject: ring-buffer: Have saved event hold the entire event
Git-commit: b049525855fdd0024881c9b14b8fbec61c3f53d3
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc6
References: git-fixes

For the ring buffer iterator (non-consuming read), the event needs to be
copied into the iterator buffer to make sure that a writer does not
overwrite it while the user is reading it. If a write happens during the
copy, the buffer is simply discarded.

But the temp buffer itself was not big enough. The allocation of the
buffer was only BUF_MAX_DATA_SIZE, which is the maximum data size that can
be passed into the ring buffer and saved. But the temp buffer needs to
hold the meta data as well. That would be BUF_PAGE_SIZE and not
BUF_MAX_DATA_SIZE.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dpu: Always flush the slave INTF on the CTL
Git-commit: 2b938c3ab0a69ec6ea587bbf6fc2aec3db4a8736
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

As we can clearly see in a downstream kernel [1], flushing the slave INTF
is skipped /only if/ the PPSPLIT topology is active.

However, when DPU was originally submitted to mainline PPSPLIT was no
longer part of it (seems to have been ripped out before submission), but
this clause was incorrectly ported from the original SDE driver.  Given
that there is no support for PPSPLIT (currently), flushing the slave
INTF should /never/ be skipped (as the `if (ppsplit && !master) goto
skip;` clause downstream never becomes true).

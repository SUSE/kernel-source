Subject: btrfs: run delayed iputs before committing the transaction for data
Git-commit: 327feeeb2e9bc68d2af1c581394ec6706f600bb9
Patch-mainline: v5.10-rc1
References: bsc#1135481

Before we were waiting on iputs after we committed the transaction, but
this doesn't really make much sense.  We want to reclaim any space we
may have in order to be more likely to commit the transaction, due to
pinned space being added by running the delayed iputs.  Fix this by
making delayed iputs run before committing the transaction.

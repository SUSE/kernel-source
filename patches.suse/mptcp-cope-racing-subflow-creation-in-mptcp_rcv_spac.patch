Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: cope racing subflow creation in mptcp_rcv_space_adjust
Git-commit: ce7356ae35943cc6494cc692e62d51a734062b7d
Patch-mainline: v6.12
References: CVE-2024-53122 bsc#1234076

Additional active subflows - i.e. created by the in kernel path
manager - are included into the subflow list before starting the
3whs.

A racing recvmsg() spooling data received on an already established
subflow would unconditionally call tcp_cleanup_rbuf() on all the
current subflows, potentially hitting a divide by zero error on
the newly created ones.

Explicitly check that the subflow is in a suitable state before
invoking tcp_cleanup_rbuf().

Subject: drm/mediatek: Call drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() at shutdown time
Git-commit: c38896ca6318c2df20bbe6c8e3f633e071fda910
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc4
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022 stable-fixes

Based on grepping through the source code this driver appears to be
missing a call to drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() at system shutdown
time. Among other things, this means that if a panel is in use that it
won't be cleanly powered off at system shutdown time.

The fact that we should call drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() in the case
of OS shutdown/restart comes straight out of the kernel doc "driver
instance overview" in drm_drv.c.

This driver users the component model and shutdown happens in the base
driver. The "drvdata" for this driver will always be valid if
shutdown() is called and as of commit 2a073968289d
("drm/atomic-helper: drm_atomic_helper_shutdown(NULL) should be a
noop") we don't need to confirm that "drm" is non-NULL.

Subject: [PATCH] inet: shrink struct flowi_common
Git-commit: 1726483b79a72e0150734d5367e4a0238bf8fcff
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1220419

I am looking at syzbot reports triggering kernel stack overflows
involving a cascade of ipvlan devices.

We can save 8 bytes in struct flowi_common.

This patch alone will not fix the issue, but is a start.

Fixes: 24ba14406c5c ("route: Add multipath_hash in flowi_common to make user-define hash")

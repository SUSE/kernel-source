Subject: net/mlx5: ECPF, wait for VF pages only after disabling host PFs
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
Git-commit: e1ed30c8c09abc85a01c897845bdbd08c0333353
References: jsc#PED-1549

Currently,  during the early stages of their unloading, particularly
during SRIOV disablement, PFs/ECPFs wait on the release of all of
their VFs memory pages. Furthermore, ECPFs are considered the page
supplier for host VFs, hence the host VFs memory pages are freed only
during ECPF cleanup when host interfaces get disabled.

Thus, disabling SRIOV early in unload timeline causes the DPU ECPF
to stall on driver unload while waiting on the release of host VF pages
that won't be freed before host interfaces get disabled later on.

Therefore, for ECPFs, wait on the release of VFs pages only after the
disablement of host PFs during ECPF cleanup flow. Then, host PFs and VFs
are disabled and their memory shall be freed accordingly.

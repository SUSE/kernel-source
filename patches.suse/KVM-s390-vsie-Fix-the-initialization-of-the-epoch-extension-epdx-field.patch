Subject: KVM: s390: vsie: Fix the initialization of the epoch extension (epdx)
 field
Git-commit: 0dd4cdccdab3d74bd86b868768a7dca216bcce7e
Patch-mainline: v6.1
References: git-fixes bsc#1215894

We recently experienced some weird huge time jumps in nested guests when
rebooting them in certain cases. After adding some debug code to the epoch
handling in vsie.c (thanks to David Hildenbrand for the idea!), it was
obvious that the "epdx" field (the multi-epoch extension) did not get set
to 0xff in case the "epoch" field was negative.
Seems like the code misses to copy the value from the epdx field from
the guest to the shadow control block. By doing so, the weird time
jumps are gone in our scenarios.

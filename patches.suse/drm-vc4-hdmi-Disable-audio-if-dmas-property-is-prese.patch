Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: hdmi: Disable audio if dmas property is present but empty
Git-commit: db2b927f8668adf3ac765e0921cd2720f5c04172
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

The dmas property is used to hold the dmaengine channel used for audio
output.

Older device trees were missing that property, so if it's not there we
disable the audio output entirely.

However, some overlays have set an empty value to that property, mostly
to workaround the fact that overlays cannot remove a property. Let's add
a test for that case and if it's empty, let's disable it as well.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Fix handling of plane refcount
Git-commit: 27227a234c1487cb7a684615f0749c455218833a
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: stable-fixes CVE-2024-56775 bsc#1235657

[Why]
The mechanism to backup and restore plane states doesn't maintain
refcount, which can cause issues if the refcount of the plane changes
in between backup and restore operations, such as memory leaks if the
refcount was supposed to go down, or double frees / invalid memory
accesses if the refcount was supposed to go up.

[How]
Cache and re-apply current refcount when restoring plane states.

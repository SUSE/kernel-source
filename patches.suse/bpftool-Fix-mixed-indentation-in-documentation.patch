Subject: bpftool: Fix mixed indentation in documentation
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: b06be5651f08bc5bc305e2a3c722ddb33b783ee5
References: jsc#PED-1368

Some paragraphs in bpftool's documentation have a mix of tabs and spaces
for indentation. Let's make it consistent.

This patch brings no change to the text content.

Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Remove #cooling-cells from fan on Theobroma
 lion
Git-commit: 5ed96580568c4f79a0aff11a67f10b3e9229ba86
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc7
References: git-fixes

All Theobroma boards use a ti,amc6821 as fan controller.
It normally runs in an automatically controlled way and while it may be
possible to use it as part of a dt-based thermal management, this is
not yet specified in the binding, nor implemented in any kernel.

Newer boards already don't contain that #cooling-cells property, but
older ones do. So remove them for now, they can be re-added if thermal
integration gets implemented in the future.

There are two further occurences in v6.12-rc in px30-ringneck and
rk3399-puma, but those already get removed by the i2c-mux conversion
scheduled for 6.13 . As the undocumented property is in the kernel so
long, I opted for not causing extra merge conflicts between 6.12 and 6.13

Subject: firmware: sysfb: Move bpp-depth calculation into screen_info helper
Git-commit: 1ce4c3aeef333be1e6290ec6d1f7891c2bfc7a1f
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499 jsc#PED-15868

Move the calculation of the bits per pixels for screen_info into a
helper function. This will make it available to other callers besides
the firmware code.

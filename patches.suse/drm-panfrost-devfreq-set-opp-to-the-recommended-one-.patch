References: git-fixes

Enabling panfrost GPU OPP with dynamic regulator will make OPP
responsible to enable and configure it.

Unfortunately OPP configure and enable the regulator when an OPP
is asked to be set, which is not the case during
panfrost_devfreq_init().

This leave the regulator unconfigured and if no GPU load is
triggered, no OPP is asked to be set which make the regulator framework
switching it off during regulator_late_cleanup() without
noticing and therefore make the board hang as any access to GPU
memory space make bus locks up.

Call dev_pm_opp_set_opp() with the recommend OPP in
panfrost_devfreq_init() to enable the regulator, this will properly
configure and enable the regulator and will avoid any switch off
by regulator_late_cleanup().

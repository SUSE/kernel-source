Subject: [PATCH] KVM: TDX: Handle TLB tracking for TDX

Handle TLB tracking for TDX by introducing function tdx_track() for private
memory TLB tracking and implementing flush_tlb* hooks to flush TLBs for
shared memory.

Introduce function tdx_track() to do TLB tracking on private memory, which
basically does two things: calling TDH.MEM.TRACK to increase TD epoch and
kicking off all vCPUs. The private EPT will then be flushed when each vCPU
re-enters the TD. This function is unused temporarily in this patch and
will be called on a page-by-page basis on removal of private guest page in
a later patch.

In earlier revisions, tdx_track() relied on an atomic counter to coordinate
the synchronization between the actions of kicking off vCPUs, incrementing
the TD epoch, and the vCPUs waiting for the incremented TD epoch after
being kicked off.

However, the core MMU only actually needs to call tdx_track() while
aleady under a write mmu_lock. So this sychnonization can be made to be
unneeded. vCPUs are kicked off only after the successful execution of
TDH.MEM.TRACK, eliminating the need for vCPUs to wait for TDH.MEM.TRACK
completion after being kicked off. tdx_track() is therefore able to send
requests KVM_REQ_OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE rather than KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH.

Hooks for flush_remote_tlb and flush_remote_tlbs_range are not necessary
for TDX, as tdx_track() will handle TLB tracking of private memory on
page-by-page basis when private guest pages are removed. There is no need
to invoke tdx_track() again in kvm_flush_remote_tlbs() even after changes
to the mirrored page table.

For hooks flush_tlb_current and flush_tlb_all, which are invoked during
kvm_mmu_load() and vcpu load for normal VMs, let VMM to flush all EPTs in
the two hooks for simplicity, since TDX does not depend on the two
hooks to notify TDX module to flush private EPT in those cases.

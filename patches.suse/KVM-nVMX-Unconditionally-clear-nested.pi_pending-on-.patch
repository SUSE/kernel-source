Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Unconditionally clear nested.pi_pending on nested VM-Enter
Git-commit: f7782bb8d818d8f47c26b22079db10599922787a
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: stable-5.14.4

commit f7782bb8d818d8f47c26b22079db10599922787a upstream.

Clear nested.pi_pending on nested VM-Enter even if L2 will run without
posted interrupts enabled.  If nested.pi_pending is left set from a
previous L2, vmx_complete_nested_posted_interrupt() will pick up the
stale flag and exit to userspace with an "internal emulation error" due
the new L2 not having a valid nested.pi_desc.

Arguably, vmx_complete_nested_posted_interrupt() should first check for
posted interrupts being enabled, but it's also completely reasonable that
KVM wouldn't screw up a fundamental flag.  Not to mention that the mere
existence of nested.pi_pending is a long-standing bug as KVM shouldn't
move the posted interrupt out of the IRR until it's actually processed,
e.g. KVM effectively drops an interrupt when it performs a nested VM-Exit
with a "pending" posted interrupt.  Fixing the mess is a future problem.

Prior to vmx_complete_nested_posted_interrupt() interpreting a null PI
descriptor as an error, this was a benign bug as the null PI descriptor
effectively served as a check on PI not being enabled.  Even then, the
new flow did not become problematic until KVM started checking the result
of kvm_check_nested_events().

Fixes: 705699a13994 ("KVM: nVMX: Enable nested posted interrupt processing")
Fixes: 966eefb89657 ("KVM: nVMX: Disable vmcs02 posted interrupts if vmcs12 PID isn't mappable")
Fixes: 47d3530f86c0 ("KVM: x86: Exit to userspace when kvm_check_nested_events fails")

Subject: blk-mq: don't grab rq's refcount in blk_mq_check_expired()
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc7
Git-commit: c797b40ccc340b8a66f7a7842aecc90bf749f087
References: bsc#1193787 git-fixes

Inside blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() we already grabbed request's
refcount before calling ->fn(), so needn't to grab it one more time
in blk_mq_check_expired().

Meantime remove extra request expire check in blk_mq_check_expired().

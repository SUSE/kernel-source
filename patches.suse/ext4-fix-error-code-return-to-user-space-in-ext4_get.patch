Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix error code return to user-space in
 ext4_get_branch()

Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: bsc#1207630

If a block is out of range in ext4_get_branch(), -ENOMEM will be returned
to user-space.  Obviously, this error code isn't really useful.  This
patch fixes it by making sure the right error code (-EFSCORRUPTED) is
propagated to user-space.  EUCLEAN is more informative than ENOMEM.

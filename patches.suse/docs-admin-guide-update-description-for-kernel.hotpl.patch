Subject: [PATCH] docs: admin-guide: update description for kernel.hotplug
 sysctl
Git-commit: 1e886090cefe26113122a7d59a36a9aec492fef5
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1

It's been a few releases since this defaulted to /sbin/hotplug. Update
the text, and include pointers to the two CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER{,_PATH}
config knobs whose help text could provide more info, but also hint
that the user probably doesn't need to care at all.

Fixes: 7934779a69f1 ("Driver-Core: disable /sbin/hotplug by default")

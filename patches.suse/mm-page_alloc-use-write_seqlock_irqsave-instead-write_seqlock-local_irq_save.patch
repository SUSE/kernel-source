Subject: [PATCH] mm/page_alloc: use write_seqlock_irqsave() instead
 write_seqlock() + local_irq_save().

References: bsc#1213179  (PREEMPT_RT functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: a2ebb51575828209b3e9d6f3c6576f7a7c70d0f6
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1

__build_all_zonelists() acquires zonelist_update_seq by first disabling
interrupts via local_irq_save() and then acquiring the seqlock with
write_seqlock().  This is troublesome and leads to problems on PREEMPT_RT.
The problem is that the inner spinlock_t becomes a sleeping lock on
PREEMPT_RT and must not be acquired with disabled interrupts.

The API provides write_seqlock_irqsave() which does the right thing in one
step.  printk_deferred_enter() has to be invoked in non-migrate-able
context to ensure that deferred printing is enabled and disabled on the
same CPU.  This is the case after zonelist_update_seq has been acquired.

There was discussion on the first submission that the order should be:
	local_irq_disable();
	printk_deferred_enter();
	write_seqlock();

to avoid pitfalls like having an unaccounted printk() coming from
write_seqlock_irqsave() before printk_deferred_enter() is invoked.  The
only origin of such a printk() can be a lockdep splat because the lockdep
annotation happens after the sequence count is incremented.  This is
exceptional and subject to change.

It was also pointed that PREEMPT_RT can be affected by the printk problem
since its write_seqlock_irqsave() does not really disable interrupts.
This isn't the case because PREEMPT_RT's printk implementation differs
from the mainline implementation in two important aspects:

- Printing happens in a dedicated threads and not at during the
  invocation of printk().
- In emergency cases where synchronous printing is used, a different
  driver is used which does not use tty_port::lock.

Acquire zonelist_update_seq with write_seqlock_irqsave() and then defer
printk output.

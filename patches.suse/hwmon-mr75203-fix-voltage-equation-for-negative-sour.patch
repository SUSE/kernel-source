Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (mr75203) fix voltage equation for negative source input
Git-commit: 227a3a2fc31d8e4bb9c88d4804e19530af245b1b
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc5
References: git-fixes

According to Moortec Embedded Voltage Monitor (MEVM) series 3 data
sheet, the minimum input signal is -100mv and maximum input signal
is +1000mv.

The equation used to convert the digital word to voltage uses mixed
types (*val signed and n unsigned), and on 64 bit machines also has
different size, since sizeof(u32) = 4 and sizeof(long) = 8.

So when measuring a negative input, n will be small enough, such that
PVT_N_CONST * n < PVT_R_CONST, and the result of
(PVT_N_CONST * n - PVT_R_CONST) will overflow to a very big positive
32 bit number. Then when storing the result in *val it will be the same
value just in 64 bit (instead of it representing a negative number which
will what happen when sizeof(long) = 4).

When -1023 <= (PVT_N_CONST * n - PVT_R_CONST) <= -1
dividing the number by 1024 should result of in 0, but because ">> 10"
is used, and the sign bit is used to fill the vacated bit positions, it
results in -1 (0xf...fffff) which is wrong.

This change fixes the sign problem and supports negative values by
casting n to long and replacing the shift right with div operation.

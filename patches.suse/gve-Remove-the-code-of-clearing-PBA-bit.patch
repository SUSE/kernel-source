Subject: [PATCH] gve: Remove the code of clearing PBA bit
Git-commit: f4c2e67c1773d2a2632381ee30e9139c1e744c16
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc2
References: git-fixes

Clearing the PBA bit from the driver is race prone and it may lead to
dropped interrupt events. This could potentially lead to the traffic
being completely halted.

Fixes: 5e8c5adf95f8 ("gve: DQO: Add core netdev features")

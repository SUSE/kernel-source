Subject: [PATCH] maple_tree: refine mas_store_root() on storing NULL
Git-commit: 0ea120b278ad7f7cfeeb606e150ad04b192df60b
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

Currently, when storing NULL on mas_store_root(), the behavior could be
improved.

Storing NULLs over the entire tree may result in a node being used to
store a single range.  Further stores of NULL may cause the node and
tree to be corrupt and cause incorrect behaviour.  Fixing the store to
the root null fixes the issue by ensuring that a range of 0 - ULONG_MAX
results in an empty tree.

Users of the tree may experience incorrect values returned if the tree
was expanded to store values, then overwritten by all NULLS, then
continued to store NULLs over the empty area.

For example possible cases are:

  * store NULL at any range result a new node
  * store NULL at range [m, n] where m > 0 to a single entry tree result
    a new node with range [m, n] set to NULL
  * store NULL at range [m, n] where m > 0 to an empty tree result
    consecutive NULL slot
  * it allows for multiple NULL entries by expanding root
    to store NULLs to an empty tree

This patch tries to improve in:

  * memory efficient by setting to empty tree instead of using a node
  * remove the possibility of consecutive NULL slot which will prohibit
    extended null in later operation

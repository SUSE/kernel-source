Subject: uapi: stddef.h: Fix __DECLARE_FLEX_ARRAY for C++
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc3
Git-commit: 32a4ec211d4164e667d9d0b807fadf02053cd2e9
References: git-fixes

__DECLARE_FLEX_ARRAY(T, member) macro expands to

	struct {
		struct {} __empty_member;
		T member[];
	};

which is subtly wrong in C++ because sizeof(struct{}) is 1 not 0,
changing UAPI structures layouts.

This can be fixed by expanding to

	T member[];

Now g++ doesn't like "T member[]" either, throwing errors on
the following code:

	struct S {
		union {
			T1 member1[];
			T2 member2[];
		};
	};

or

	struct S {
		T member[];
	};

Use "T member[0];" which seems to work and does the right thing wrt
structure layout.

Subject: bpf: Improve check_raw_mode_ok test for MEM_UNINIT-tagged types
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
Git-commit: 18752d73c1898fd001569195ba4b0b8c43255f4a
References: git-fixes

When checking malformed helper function signatures, also take other argument
types into account aside from just ARG_PTR_TO_UNINIT_MEM.

This concerns (formerly) ARG_PTR_TO_{INT,LONG} given uninitialized memory can
be passed there, too.

The func proto sanity check goes back to commit 435faee1aae9 ("bpf, verifier:
add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type"), and its purpose was to detect wrong func protos
which had more than just one MEM_UNINIT-tagged type as arguments.

The reason more than one is currently not supported is as we mark stack slots with
STACK_MISC in check_helper_call() in case of raw mode based on meta.access_size to
allow uninitialized stack memory to be passed to helpers when they just write into
the buffer.

Probing for base type as well as MEM_UNINIT tagging ensures that other types do not
get missed (as it used to be the case for ARG_PTR_TO_{INT,LONG}).

Fixes: 57c3bb725a3d ("bpf: Introduce ARG_PTR_TO_{INT,LONG} arg types")

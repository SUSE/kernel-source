Subject: [PATCH] usb: gadget: f_midi: fix MIDI Streaming descriptor lengths
Git-commit: da1668997052ed1cb00322e1f3b63702615c9429
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc3
References: git-fixes CVE-2025-21835 bsc#1239068

While the MIDI jacks are configured correctly, and the MIDIStreaming
endpoint descriptors are filled with the correct information,
bNumEmbMIDIJack and bLength are set incorrectly in these descriptors.

This does not matter when the numbers of in and out ports are equal, but
when they differ the host will receive broken descriptors with
uninitialized stack memory leaking into the descriptor for whichever
value is smaller.

The precise meaning of "in" and "out" in the port counts is not clearly
defined and can be confusing.  But elsewhere the driver consistently
uses this to match the USB meaning of IN and OUT viewed from the host,
so that "in" ports send data to the host and "out" ports receive data
from it.

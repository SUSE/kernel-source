Subject: [PATCH] usb: ohci: Prevent missed ohci interrupts
Git-commit: fe81f354841641c7f71163b84912b25c169ed8ec
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc7
References: git-fixes

Testing ohci functionality with qemu's pci-ohci emulation often results
in ohci interface stalls, resulting in hung task timeouts.

The problem is caused by lost interrupts between the emulation and the
Linux kernel code. Additional interrupts raised while the ohci interrupt
handler in Linux is running and before the handler clears the interrupt
status are not handled. The fix for a similar problem in ehci suggests
that the problem is likely caused by edge-triggered MSI interrupts. See
commit 0b60557230ad ("usb: ehci: Prevent missed ehci interrupts with
edge-triggered MSI") for details.

Ensure that the ohci interrupt code handles all pending interrupts before
returning to solve the problem.

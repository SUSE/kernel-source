Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: PNP: Add Intel OC Watchdog IDs to non-PNP device list
Git-commit: f06777cf2bbc21dd8c71d6e3906934e56b4e18e4
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: stable-fixes

Intel Over-Clocking Watchdogs are described in ACPI tables by both the
generic PNP0C02 _CID and their ACPI _HID. The presence of the _CID then
causes the PNP scan handler to attach to the watchdog, preventing the
actual watchdog driver from binding. Address this by adding the ACPI
_HIDs to the list of non-PNP devices, so that the PNP scan handler is
bypassed.

Note that these watchdogs can be described by multiple _HIDs for what
seems to be identical hardware. This commit is not a complete list of
all the possible watchdog ACPI _HIDs.

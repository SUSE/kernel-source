Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: net: Reintroduce PHY no lane swap binding
Git-commit: 96db48c9d777a73a33b1d516c5cfed7a417a5f40
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc5
References: git-fixes

This binding was already documented in phy.txt, commit 252ae5330daa
("documentation: devicetree: Add PHY no lane swap binding"), but got
accidently removed during YAML conversion in commit d8704342c109
("dt-bindings: net: Add a YAML schemas for the generic PHY options").

Note: 'enet-phy-lane-no-swap' and the absence of 'enet-phy-lane-swap' are
not identical, as the former one disable this feature, while the latter
one doesn't change anything.

Fixes: d8704342c109 ("dt-bindings: net: Add a YAML schemas for the generic PHY options")

Subject: tracing: Fix a possible race when disabling buffered events
Git-commit: c0591b1cccf708a47bc465c62436d669a4213323
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc5
References: bsc#1217036

Function trace_buffered_event_disable() is responsible for freeing pages
backing buffered events and this process can run concurrently with
trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve().

The following race is currently possible:

* Function trace_buffered_event_disable() is called on CPU 0. It
  increments trace_buffered_event_cnt on each CPU and waits via
  synchronize_rcu() for each user of trace_buffered_event to complete.

* After synchronize_rcu() is finished, function
  trace_buffered_event_disable() has the exclusive access to
  trace_buffered_event. All counters trace_buffered_event_cnt are at 1
  and all pointers trace_buffered_event are still valid.

* At this point, on a different CPU 1, the execution reaches
  trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve(). The function calls
  preempt_disable_notrace() and only now enters an RCU read-side
  critical section. The function proceeds and reads a still valid
  pointer from trace_buffered_event[CPU1] into the local variable
  "entry". However, it doesn't yet read trace_buffered_event_cnt[CPU1]
  which happens later.

* Function trace_buffered_event_disable() continues. It frees
  trace_buffered_event[CPU1] and decrements
  trace_buffered_event_cnt[CPU1] back to 0.

* Function trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve() continues. It reads and
  increments trace_buffered_event_cnt[CPU1] from 0 to 1. This makes it
  believe that it can use the "entry" that it already obtained but the
  pointer is now invalid and any access results in a use-after-free.

Fix the problem by making a second synchronize_rcu() call after all
trace_buffered_event values are set to NULL. This waits on all potential
users in trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve() that still read a previous
pointer from trace_buffered_event.

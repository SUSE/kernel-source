Subject: dt-bindings: iommu: apple,dart: Add power-domains property
Git-commit: 364609125e2ca745c698ec157615ff179b239344
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsc#1205701

This will bind to the PMGR pwrstate nodes that control power/clock
gating to SoC blocks. The DART driver doesn't do runtime-pm yet, so
initially this will just keep the domain on permanently.

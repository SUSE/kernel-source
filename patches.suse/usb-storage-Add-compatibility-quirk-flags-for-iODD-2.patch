Subject: [PATCH] usb-storage: Add compatibility quirk flags for iODD 2531/2541
Git-commit: 05c8f1b67e67dcd786ae3fe44492bbc617b4bd12
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: git-fixes

These drive enclosures have firmware bugs that make it impossible to mount
a new virtual ISO image after Linux ejects the old one if the device is
locked by Linux. Windows bypasses this problem by the fact that they do
not lock the device. Add a quirk to disable device locking for these
drive enclosures.

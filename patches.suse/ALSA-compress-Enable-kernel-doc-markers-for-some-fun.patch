Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: compress: Enable kernel doc markers for some functions
Git-commit: 539311aa61a144088779f1354492bbf9ae1ac458
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: jsc#PED-850

The exported functions snd_compress_new() and snd_compr_stop_error()
had already kernel-doc-style comments but they were not processed as
they weren't marked properly.  Let's enable them.

This patch also fixes the missing argument id for snd_compress_new
comments, too.

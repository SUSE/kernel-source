Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6q: add missing properties for sram
Git-commit: b11d083c5dcec7c42fe982c854706d404ddd3a5f

All 3 properties are required by sram.yaml. Fixes the dtbs_check warning:
Sram@900000: '#address-cells' is a required property
Sram@900000: '#size-cells' is a required property
Sram@900000: 'ranges' is a required property

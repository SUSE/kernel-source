Subject: vfio: Define device migration protocol v2
Git-commit: 115dcec65f61d53e25e1bed5e380468b30f98b14
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: bsc#1205701

Replace the existing region based migration protocol with an ioctl based
protocol. The two protocols have the same general semantic behaviors, but
the way the data is transported is changed.

This is the STOP_COPY portion of the new protocol, it defines the 5 states
for basic stop and copy migration and the protocol to move the migration
data in/out of the kernel.

Compared to the clarification of the v1 protocol Alex proposed:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/163909282574.728533.7460416142511440919.stgit@omen

This has a few deliberate functional differences:

 - ERROR arcs allow the device function to remain unchanged.

 - The protocol is not required to return to the original state on
   transition failure. Instead userspace can execute an unwind back to
   the original state, reset, or do something else without needing kernel
   support. This simplifies the kernel design and should userspace choose
   a policy like always reset, avoids doing useless work in the kernel
   on error handling paths.

 - PRE_COPY is made optional, userspace must discover it before using it.
   This reflects the fact that the majority of drivers we are aware of
   right now will not implement PRE_COPY.

 - segmentation is not part of the data stream protocol, the receiver
   does not have to reproduce the framing boundaries.

The hybrid FSM for the device_state is described as a Mealy machine by
documenting each of the arcs the driver is required to implement. Defining
the remaining set of old/new device_state transitions as 'combination
transitions' which are naturally defined as taking multiple FSM arcs along
the shortest path within the FSM's digraph allows a complete matrix of
transitions.

A new VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE of VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_MIG_DEVICE_STATE is
defined to replace writing to the device_state field in the region. This
allows returning a brand new FD whenever the requested transition opens
a data transfer session.

The VFIO core code implements the new feature and provides a helper
function to the driver. Using the helper the driver only has to
implement 6 of the FSM arcs and the other combination transitions are
elaborated consistently from those arcs.

A new VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE of VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_MIGRATION is defined to
report the capability for migration and indicate which set of states and
arcs are supported by the device. The FSM provides a lot of flexibility to
make backwards compatible extensions but the VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE also
allows for future breaking extensions for scenarios that cannot support
even the basic STOP_COPY requirements.

The VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_MIG_DEVICE_STATE with the GET option (i.e.
VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_GET) can be used to read the current migration state
of the VFIO device.

Data transfer sessions are now carried over a file descriptor, instead of
the region. The FD functions for the lifetime of the data transfer
session. read() and write() transfer the data with normal Linux stream FD
semantics. This design allows future expansion to support poll(),
io_uring, and other performance optimizations.

The complicated mmap mode for data transfer is discarded as current qemu
doesn't take meaningful advantage of it, and the new qemu implementation
avoids substantially all the performance penalty of using a read() on the
region.

+ *
+ *   The STOP_COPY arc will terminate a data transfer session.
+ *
+ * RESUMING -> STOP
+ *   Leaving RESUMING terminates a data transfer session and indicates the
+ *   device should complete processing of the data delivered by write(). The
+ *   kernel migration driver should complete the incorporation of data written
+ *   to the data transfer FD into the device internal state and perform

+ *   user provided data is found to be incomplete, inconsistent, or otherwise
+ *   invalid, the migration driver must fail the SET_STATE ioctl and
+ *   optionally go to the ERROR state as described below.
+ *
+ *   While in STOP the device has the same behavior as other STOP states
+ *   described above.
+ *
+ *   To abort a RESUMING session the device must be reset.
+ *
+ * STOP -> RUNNING
+ *   While in RUNNING the device is fully operational, the device may generate
+ *   interrupts, DMA, respond to MMIO, all vfio device regions are functional,
+ *   and the device may advance its internal state.
+ *
+ * STOP -> STOP_COPY
+ *   This arc begin the process of saving the device state and will return a
+ *   new data_fd.
+ *
+ *   While in the STOP_COPY state the device has the same behavior as STOP
+ *   with the addition that the data transfers session continues to stream the
+ *   migration state. End of stream on the FD indicates the entire device
+ *   state has been transferred.
+ *
+ *   The user should take steps to restrict access to vfio device regions while
+ *   the device is in STOP_COPY or risk corruption of the device migration data
+ *   stream.
+ *
+ * STOP -> RESUMING
+ *   Entering the RESUMING state starts a process of restoring the device state
+ *   and will return a new data_fd. The data stream fed into the data_fd should
+ *   be taken from the data transfer output of a single FD during saving from
+ *   a compatible device. The migration driver may alter/reset the internal
+ *   device state for this arc if required to prepare the device to receive the
+ *   migration data.
+ *
+ * any -> ERROR
+ *   ERROR cannot be specified as a device state, however any transition request
+ *   can be failed with an errno return and may then move the device_state into
+ *   ERROR. In this case the device was unable to execute the requested arc and
+ *   was also unable to restore the device to any valid device_state.
+ *   To recover from ERROR VFIO_DEVICE_RESET must be used to return the
+ *   device_state back to RUNNING.
+ *
+ * The remaining possible transitions are interpreted as combinations of the
+ * above FSM arcs. As there are multiple paths through the FSM arcs the path
+ * should be selected based on the following rules:
+ *   - Select the shortest path.
+ * Refer to vfio_mig_get_next_state() for the result of the algorithm.
+ *
+ * The automatic transit through the FSM arcs that make up the combination
+ * transition is invisible to the user. When working with combination arcs the
+ * user may see any step along the path in the device_state if SET_STATE
+ * fails. When handling these types of errors users should anticipate future
+ * revisions of this protocol using new states and those states becoming

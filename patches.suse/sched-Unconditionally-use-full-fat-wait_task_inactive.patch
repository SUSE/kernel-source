Subject: [PATCH] sched: Unconditionally use full-fat wait_task_inactive()

References: bsc#1212887 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: d5e1586617be7093ea3419e3fa9387ed833cdbb1
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1

While modifying wait_task_inactive() for PREEMPT_RT; the build robot
noted that UP got broken. This led to audit and consideration of the
UP implementation of wait_task_inactive().

It looks like the UP implementation is also broken for PREEMPT;
consider task_current_syscall() getting preempted between the two
calls to wait_task_inactive().

Therefore move the wait_task_inactive() implementation out of
CONFIG_SMP and unconditionally use it.

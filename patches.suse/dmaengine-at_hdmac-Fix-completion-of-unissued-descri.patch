Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: at_hdmac: Fix completion of unissued descriptor in case of errors
Git-commit: ef2cb4f0ce479f77607b04c4b0414bf32f863ee8
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc5
References: git-fixes

In case the controller detected an error, the code took the chance to move
all the queued (submitted) descriptors to the active (issued) list. This
was wrong as if there were any descriptors in the submitted list they were
moved to the issued list without actually issuing them to the controller,
thus a completion could be raised without even fireing the descriptor.

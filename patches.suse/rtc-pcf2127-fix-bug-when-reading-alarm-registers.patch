Subject: [PATCH] rtc: pcf2127: fix bug when reading alarm registers
Git-commit: 73ce05302007eece23a6acb7dc124c92a2209087
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

The first bug is that reading the 5 alarm registers results in a read
operation of 20 bytes. The reason is because the destination buffer is
defined as an array of "unsigned int", and we use the sizeof()
operator on this array to define the bulk read count.

The second bug is that the read value is invalid, because we are
indexing the destination buffer as integers (4 bytes), instead of
indexing it as u8.

Changing the destination buffer type to u8 fixes both problems.

Subject: ice: Prevent probing virtual functions
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc6
Git-commit: 50ac7479846053ca8054be833c1594e64de496bb
References: git-fixes

The userspace utility "driverctl" can be used to change/override the
system's default driver choices. This is useful in some situations
(buggy driver, old driver missing a device ID, trying a workaround,
etc.) where the user needs to load a different driver.

However, this is also prone to user error, where a driver is mapped
to a device it's not designed to drive. For example, if the ice driver
is mapped to driver iavf devices, the ice driver crashes.

Add a check to return an error if the ice driver is being used to
probe a virtual function.

Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: Fix duplicate statement about raw_spinlock_t type
Git-commit: 8d6451b9a51b555be2c9a6c326a980b2de00741a
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Unless it was duplicate on purpose, to emphasize that a raw_spinlock_t
is always a spinning lock regardless of PREEMPT_RT or kernel config,
it's a bit odd that this text is duplicate. So, this patch just clean
it up, keeping the consistency with the other sections of the text.

Subject: scsi: vmw_pvscsi: Set correct residual data length
Git-commit: e662502b3a782d479e67736a5a1c169a703d853a
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc4
References: git-fixes

Some commands (such as INQUIRY) may return less data than the initiator
requested. To avoid conducting useless information, set the right residual
count to make upper layer aware of this.

Before (INQUIRY PAGE 0xB0 with 128B buffer):

$ sg_raw -r 128 /dev/sda 12 01 B0 00 80 00
SCSI Status: Good

Received 128 bytes of data:
 00 00 b0 00 3c 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ...<............

After:

$ sg_raw -r 128 /dev/sda 12 01 B0 00 80 00

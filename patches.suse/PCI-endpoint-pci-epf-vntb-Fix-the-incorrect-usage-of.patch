Subject: [PATCH] PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-vntb: Fix the incorrect usage of __iomem attribute
Git-commit: 61ae7f8694fb4b57a8c02a1a8d2b601806afc999
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

__iomem attribute is supposed to be used only with variables holding the
MMIO pointer. But here, 'mw_addr' variable is just holding a 'void *'
returned by pci_epf_alloc_space(). So annotating it with __iomem is clearly
wrong. Hence, drop the attribute.

This also fixes the below sparse warning:

Subject: [PATCH] usb: potential integer overflow in usbg_make_tpg()
Git-commit: 153874010354d050f62f8ae25cbb960c17633dc5
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: stable-fixes

The variable tpgt in usbg_make_tpg() is defined as unsigned long and is
assigned to tpgt->tport_tpgt, which is defined as u16. This may cause an
integer overflow when tpgt is greater than USHRT_MAX (65535). I
haven't tried to trigger it myself, but it is possible to trigger it
by calling usbg_make_tpg() with a large value for tpgt.

I modified the type of tpgt to match tpgt->tport_tpgt and adjusted the
relevant code accordingly.

This patch is similar to commit 59c816c1f24d ("vhost/scsi: potential
memory corruption").

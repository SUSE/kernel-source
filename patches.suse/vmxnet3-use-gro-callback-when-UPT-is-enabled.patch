Subject: vmxnet3: use gro callback when UPT is enabled
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc5
Git-commit: 3bced313b9a5a237c347e0f079c8c2fe4b3935aa
References: bsc#1209739

Currently, vmxnet3 uses GRO callback only if LRO is disabled. However,
on smartNic based setups where UPT is supported, LRO can be enabled
from guest VM but UPT devicve does not support LRO as of now. In such
cases, there can be performance degradation as GRO is not being done.

This patch fixes this issue by calling GRO API when UPT is enabled. We
use updateRxProd to determine if UPT mode is active or not.

To clarify few things discussed over the thread:
The patch is not neglecting any feature bits nor disabling GRO. It uses
GRO callback when UPT is active as LRO is not available in UPT.
GRO callback cannot be used as default for all cases as it degrades
performance for non-UPT cases or for cases when LRO is already done in
ESXi.

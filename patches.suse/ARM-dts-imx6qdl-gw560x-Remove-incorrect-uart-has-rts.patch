Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6qdl-gw560x: Remove incorrect 'uart-has-rtscts'
Git-commit: 9dfbc72256b5de608ad10989bcbafdbbd1ac8d4e
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc5
References: git-fixes

The following build warning is seen when running:

make dtbs_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=fsl-imx-uart.yaml

Arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6dl-gw560x.dtb: serial@2020000: rts-gpios: False schema does not allow [[20, 1, 0]]	From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/fsl-imx-uart.yaml

The imx6qdl-gw560x board does not expose the UART RTS and CTS
as native UART pins, so 'uart-has-rtscts' should not be used.

Using 'uart-has-rtscts' with 'rts-gpios' is an invalid combination
detected by serial.yaml.

Fix the problem by removing the incorrect 'uart-has-rtscts' property.

Subject: drm/amdgpu: fix runpm documentation
Git-commit: 4d625a97a7e96be016382e3bb0a3cead05fec153
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc8
References: jsc#PED-1166 jsc#PED-1168 jsc#PED-1170 jsc#PED-1218 jsc#PED-1220 jsc#PED-1222 jsc#PED-1223 jsc#PED-1225

It's not only supported by HG/PX laptops.  It's supported
by all dGPUs which supports BOCO/BACO functionality (runtime
D3).

BOCO - Bus Off, Chip Off.  The entire chip is powered off.
       This is controlled by ACPI.
BACO - Bus Active, Chip Off.  The chip still shows up
       on the PCI bus, but the device itself is powered
       down.

v2: fix missed HG/PX reference

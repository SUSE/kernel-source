Subject: [PATCH] md/raid10: fix io loss while replacement replace rdev
Git-commit: 2ae6aaf76912bae53c74b191569d2ab484f24bf3
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: git-fixes

When removing a disk with replacement, the replacement will be used to
replace rdev. During this process, there is a brief window in which both
rdev and replacement are read as NULL in raid10_write_request(). This
will result in io not being submitted but it should be.

  //remove				//write
  raid10_remove_disk			raid10_write_request
   mirror->rdev = NULL
					 read rdev -> NULL
   mirror->rdev = mirror->replacement
   mirror->replacement = NULL
					 read replacement -> NULL

Fix it by reading replacement first and rdev later, meanwhile, use smp_mb()
to prevent memory reordering.

Fixes: 475b0321a4df ("md/raid10: writes should get directed to replacement as well as original.")

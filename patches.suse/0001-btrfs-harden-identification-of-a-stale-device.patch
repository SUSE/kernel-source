Subject: [PATCH 1/4] btrfs: harden identification of a stale device

Identifying and removing the stale device from the fs_uuids list is done
by btrfs_free_stale_devices().  btrfs_free_stale_devices() in turn
depends on device_path_matched() to check if the device appears in more
than one btrfs_device structure.

The matching of the device happens by its path, the device path. However,
when device mapper is in use, the dm device paths are nothing but a link
to the actual block device, which leads to the device_path_matched()
failing to match.

Fix this by matching the dev_t as provided by lookup_bdev() instead of
plain string compare of the device paths.

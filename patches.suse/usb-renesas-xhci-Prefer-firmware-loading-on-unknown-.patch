Subject: [PATCH] usb: renesas-xhci: Prefer firmware loading on unknown ROM
 state
Message-Id: <20210819113427.1166-1-tiwai@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: Submitted, linux-usb ML
References: bsc#1189207

The recent attempt to handle an unknown ROM state in the commit
d143825baf15 ("usb: renesas-xhci: Fix handling of unknown ROM state")
resulted in a regression and reverted later by the commit 44cf53602f5a
("Revert "usb: renesas-xhci: Fix handling of unknown ROM state"").
The problem of the former fix was that it treated the failure of
firmware loading as a fatal error.  Since the firmware files aren't
included in the standard linux-firmware tree, most users don't have
them, hence they got the non-working system after that.  The revert
fixed the regression, but also it didn't make the firmware loading
triggered even on the devices that do need it.  So we need still a fix
for them.

This is another attempt to handle the unknown ROM state.  Like the
previous fix, this also tries to load the firmware when ROM shows
unknown state.  In this patch, however, the failure of a firmware
loading (such as a missing firmware file) isn't handled as a fatal
error any longer when ROM has been already detected, but it falls back
to the ROM mode like before.  The error is returned only when no ROM
is detected and the firmware loading failed.

Along with it, for simplifying the code flow, the detection and the
check of ROM is factored out from renesas_fw_check_running() and done
in the caller side, renesas_xhci_check_request_fw().  It avoids the
redundant ROM checks.

The patch was tested on Lenovo Thinkpad T14 gen (BIOS 1.34).  Also it
was confirmed that no regression is seen on another Thinkpad T14
machine that has worked without the patch, too.

+Part Ie - IOVA-based DMA mappings
+---------------------------------
+
+These APIs allow a very efficient mapping when using an IOMMU.  They are an
+optional path that requires extra code and are only recommended for drivers
+where DMA mapping performance, or the space usage for storing the DMA addresses
+matter.  All the considerations from the previous section apply here as well.
+
+::
+
+    bool dma_iova_try_alloc(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
+		phys_addr_t phys, size_t size);
+
+Is used to try to allocate IOVA space for mapping operation.  If it returns
+false this API can't be used for the given device and the normal streaming
+DMA mapping API should be used.  The ``struct dma_iova_state`` is allocated
+by the driver and must be kept around until unmap time.
+
+::
+
+    static inline bool dma_use_iova(struct dma_iova_state *state)
+
+Can be used by the driver to check if the IOVA-based API is used after a
+call to dma_iova_try_alloc.  This can be useful in the unmap path.
+
+::
+
+    int dma_iova_link(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
+		phys_addr_t phys, size_t offset, size_t size,
+		enum dma_data_direction dir, unsigned long attrs);
+
+Is used to link ranges to the IOVA previously allocated.  The start of all
+but the first call to dma_iova_link for a given state must be aligned
+to the DMA merge boundary returned by ``dma_get_merge_boundary())``, and
+the size of all but the last range must be aligned to the DMA merge boundary
+as well.
+
+::
+
+    int dma_iova_sync(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
+		size_t offset, size_t size);
+
+Must be called to sync the IOMMU page tables for IOVA-range mapped by one or
+more calls to ``dma_iova_link()``.
+
+For drivers that use a one-shot mapping, all ranges can be unmapped and the
+IOVA freed by calling:
+
+::
+
+   void dma_iova_destroy(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
+		size_t mapped_len, enum dma_data_direction dir,
+                unsigned long attrs);
+
+Alternatively drivers can dynamically manage the IOVA space by unmapping
+and mapping individual regions.  In that case
+
+::
+
+    void dma_iova_unlink(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state,
+		size_t offset, size_t size, enum dma_data_direction dir,
+		unsigned long attrs);
+
+is used to unmap a range previously mapped, and
+
+::
+
+   void dma_iova_free(struct device *dev, struct dma_iova_state *state);
+
+is used to free the IOVA space.  All regions must have been unmapped using
+``dma_iova_unlink()`` before calling ``dma_iova_free()``.

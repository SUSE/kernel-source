Subject: arm64: dts: allwinner: a64-sopine-baseboard: change RGMII mode to
 TXID
Git-commit: bd5431b2f9b30a70f6ed964dd5ee9a6d1c397c06
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: bsc#1202341

Although the schematics of Pine A64-LTS and SoPine Baseboard shows both
the RX and TX internal delay are enabled, they're using the same broken
RTL8211E chip batch with Pine A64+, so they should use TXID instead, not
ID.

In addition, by checking the real components soldered on both a SoPine
Baseboard and a Pine A64-LTS, RX delay is not enabled (GR69 soldered and
GR70 NC) despite the schematics says it's enabled. It's a common
situation for Pine64 boards that the NC information on schematics is not
the same with the board.

So the RGMII delay mode should be TXID on these boards.

Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Use weight of SD_NUMA domain in
 find_busiest_group

References: bsc#1192120
Patch-mainline: Not yet, posted but review pending

find_busiest_group uses the child domain's group weight instead of
the sched_domain's weight that has SD_NUMA set when calculating the
allowed imbalance between NUMA nodes. This is wrong and inconsistent
with find_idlest_group.

This patch uses the SD_NUMA weight in both.

Fixes: c4e8f691d926 ("sched/fair: Adjust the allowed NUMA imbalance when SD_NUMA spans multiple LLCS")

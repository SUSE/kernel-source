Subject: printk: Disable passing console lock owner completely during panic()
Git-commit: d04d5882cd678b898a9d7c5aee6afbe9e6e77fcd
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1223574

The commit d51507098ff91 ("printk: disable optimistic spin
during panic") added checks to avoid becoming a console waiter
if a panic is in progress.

However, the transition to panic can occur while there is
already a waiter. The current owner should not pass the lock to
the waiter because it might get stopped or blocked anytime.

Also the panic context might pass the console lock owner to an
already stopped waiter by mistake. It might happen when
console_flush_on_panic() ignores the current lock owner, for
example:

CPU0                                CPU1
----                                ----
console_lock_spinning_enable()
                                    console_trylock_spinning()
                                      [CPU1 now console waiter]
NMI: panic()
  panic_other_cpus_shutdown()
                                    [stopped as console waiter]
  console_flush_on_panic()
    console_lock_spinning_enable()
    [print 1 record]
    console_lock_spinning_disable_and_check()
      [handover to stopped CPU1]

This results in panic() not flushing the panic messages.

Fix these problems by disabling all spinning operations
completely during panic().

Another advantage is that it prevents possible deadlocks caused
by "console_owner_lock". The panic() context does not need to
take it any longer. The lockless checks are safe because the
functions become NOPs when they see the panic in progress. All
operations manipulating the state are still synchronized by the
lock even when non-panic CPUs would notice the panic
synchronously.

The current owner might stay spinning. But non-panic() CPUs
would get stopped anyway and the panic context will never start
spinning.

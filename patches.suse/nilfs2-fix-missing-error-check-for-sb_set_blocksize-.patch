Subject: [PATCH] nilfs2: fix missing error check for sb_set_blocksize call
Git-commit: d61d0ab573649789bf9eb909c89a1a193b2e3d10
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc5
References: git-fixes

When mounting a filesystem image with a block size larger than the page
size, nilfs2 repeatedly outputs long error messages with stack traces to
the kernel log, such as the following:

 getblk(): invalid block size 8192 requested
 logical block size: 512
 ...
 Call Trace:
  dump_stack_lvl+0x92/0xd4
  dump_stack+0xd/0x10
  bdev_getblk+0x33a/0x354
  __breadahead+0x11/0x80

  do_fast_syscall_32+0x29/0x58
  do_SYSENTER_32+0x15/0x18
  entry_SYSENTER_32+0x98/0xf1
 ...

This overloads the system logger.  And to make matters worse, it sometimes
crashes the kernel with a memory access violation.

This is because the return value of the sb_set_blocksize() call, which
should be checked for errors, is not checked.

The latter issue is due to out-of-buffer memory being accessed based on a
large block size that caused sb_set_blocksize() to fail for buffers read
with the initial minimum block size that remained unupdated in the
super_block structure.

Since nilfs2 mkfs tool does not accept block sizes larger than the system
page size, this has been overlooked.  However, it is possible to create
this situation by intentionally modifying the tool or by passing a
filesystem image created on a system with a large page size to a system
with a smaller page size and mounting it.

Fix this issue by inserting the expected error handling for the call to
sb_set_blocksize().

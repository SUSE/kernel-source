Subject: s390/qeth: Fix potential loss of L3-IP@ in case of network issues
Git-commit: 2fe8a236436fe40d8d26a1af8d150fc80f04ee1a
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc4
References: git-fixes bsc#1219840

Symptom:
In case of a bad cable connection (e.g. dirty optics) a fast sequence of
network DOWN-UP-DOWN-UP could happen. UP triggers recovery of the qeth
interface. In case of a second DOWN while recovery is still ongoing, it
can happen that the IP@ of a Layer3 qeth interface is lost and will not
be recovered by the second UP.

Problem:
When registration of IP addresses with Layer 3 qeth devices fails, (e.g.
because of bad address format) the respective IP address is deleted from
its hash-table in the driver. If registration fails because of a ENETDOWN
condition, the address should stay in the hashtable, so a subsequent
recovery can restore it.

3caa4af834df ("qeth: keep ip-address after LAN_OFFLINE failure")
fixes this for registration failures during normal operation, but not
during recovery.

Solution:
Keep L3-IP address in case of ENETDOWN in qeth_l3_recover_ip(). For
consistency with qeth_l3_add_ip() we also keep it in case of EADDRINUSE,
i.e. for some reason the card already/still has this address registered.

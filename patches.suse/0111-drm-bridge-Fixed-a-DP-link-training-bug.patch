Subject: drm/bridge: Fixed a DP link training bug
Git-commit: ca077ff8cac5af8a5a3c476983a6dd54aa3511b7
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

To have better compatibility for DP sink, there is a retry mechanism
for the link training process to switch between different training process.
The original driver code doesn't reset the retry counter when training
state is pass. If the system triggers link training over 3 times,
there will be a chance to causes the driver to use the wrong training
method and return a training fail result.

To Fix this, we reset the retry counter when training state is pass
each time.

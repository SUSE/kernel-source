Subject: drm/hyperv: Don't overwrite dirt_needed value set by host
Git-commit: 19b5e6659eaf537ebeac90ae30c7df0296fe5ab9
References: bsc#1211281

Existing code is causing a race condition where dirt_needed value is
already set by the host and gets overwritten with default value. Remove
this default setting of dirt_needed, to avoid overwriting the value
received in the channel callback set by vmbus_open. Removing this
setting also means the default value for dirt_needed is changed to false
as it's allocated by kzalloc which is similar to legacy hyperv_fb driver.

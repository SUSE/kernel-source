Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: fix leak on sgl setup error
Git-commit: 4e6e151cf92bbaa0622a4da351ff444e4fd9b865
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: jsc#PED-14161

We need to free the descriptor that was allocated. We also don't
necessarily need to unmap each sgl entry, which was previously being
attempted unconditionally.

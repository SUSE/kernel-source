Subject: [PATCH] admin-guide/hw-vuln/core-scheduling: fix return type of PR_SCHED_CORE_GET

sched_core_share_pid() copies the cookie to userspace with
put_user(id, (u64 __user *)uaddr), expecting 64 bits of space.
The "unsigned long" datatype that is documented in core-scheduling.rst
however is only 32 bits large on 32 bit architectures.

Document "unsigned long long" as the correct data type that is always
64bits large.

This matches what the selftest cs_prctl_test.c has been doing all along.

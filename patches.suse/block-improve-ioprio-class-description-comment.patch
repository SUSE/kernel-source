Subject: [PATCH] block: improve ioprio class description comment
Git-commit: 25bca50e523cbe96c0207fbb92f22ff2bc28e9aa
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-1183

In include/usapi/linux/ioprio.h, change the ioprio class enum comment
to remove the outdated reference to CFQ and mention BFQ and mq-deadline
instead. Also document the high priority NCQ command use for RT class
IOs directed at ATA drives that support NCQ priority.

Subject: arm64: Handle KCOV __init vs inline mismatches
Git-commit: 65c430906efffee9bd7551d474f01a6b1197df90
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

GCC appears to have kind of fragile inlining heuristics, in the
sense that it can change whether or not it inlines something based on
optimizations. It looks like the kcov instrumentation being added (or in
this case, removed) from a function changes the optimization results,
and some functions marked "inline" are _not_ inlined. In that case,
we end up with __init code calling a function not marked __init, and we
get the build warnings I'm trying to eliminate in the coming patch that
adds __no_sanitize_coverage to __init functions:

WARNING: modpost: vmlinux: section mismatch in reference: acpi_get_enable_method+0x1c (section: .text.unlikely) -> acpi_psci_present (section: .init.text)

This problem is somewhat fragile (though using either __always_inline
or __init will deterministically solve it), but we've tripped over
this before with GCC and the solution has usually been to just use
__always_inline and move on.

For arm64 this requires forcing one ACPI function to be inlined with
__always_inline.

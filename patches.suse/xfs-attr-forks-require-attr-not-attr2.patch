Subject: [PATCH] xfs: attr forks require attr, not attr2
Git-commit: 73c34b0b85d46bf9c2c0b367aeaffa1e2481b136
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc4
References: git-fixes

It turns out that I misunderstood the difference between the attr and
attr2 feature bits.  "attr" means that at some point an attr fork was
created somewhere in the filesystem.  "attr2" means that inodes have
variable-sized forks, but says nothing about whether or not there
actually /are/ attr forks in the system.

If we have an attr fork, we only need to check that attr is set.

Subject: tools: hv: lsvmbus: change shebang to use python3
Git-commit: c6e2b45a544b45ce1a26858ded61a0dc4896d54a
References: git-fixes

In many modern Linux distros, running `lsvmbus` returns the error:
```
/usr/bin/env: 'python': No such file or directory
```
because 'python' doesn't point anywhere.

Now that python2 has reached EOL as of January 1, 2020 and is no longer
maintained[1], these distros have python3 instead.

Also, the script isn't executable by default because the permissions are
set to mode 644.

Fix this by updating the shebang in the `lsvmbus` to use python3 instead
of python. Also fix the permissions to be 755 so that is executable by
default, which matches other similar scripts in `tools/hv`.

The script is also tested and verified that is compatible with
python3.

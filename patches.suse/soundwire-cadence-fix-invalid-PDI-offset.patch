Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: cadence: fix invalid PDI offset
Git-commit: 8ee1b439b1540ae543149b15a2a61b9dff937d91
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: stable-fixes CVE-2024-38635 bsc#1226863

For some reason, we add an offset to the PDI, presumably to skip the
PDI0 and PDI1 which are reserved for BPT.

This code is however completely wrong and leads to an out-of-bounds
access. We were just lucky so far since we used only a couple of PDIs
and remained within the PDI array bounds.

A Fixes: tag is not provided since there are no known platforms where
the out-of-bounds would be accessed, and the initial code had problems
as well.

A follow-up patch completely removes this useless offset.

Subject: [PATCH] net/x25: Fix to not accept on connected socket
Git-commit: f2b0b5210f67c56a3bcdf92ff665fb285d6e0067
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc6
References: git-fixes

When listen() and accept() are called on an x25 socket
that connect() succeeds, accept() succeeds immediately.
This is because x25_connect() queues the skb to
sk->sk_receive_queue, and x25_accept() dequeues it.

This creates a child socket with the sk of the parent
x25 socket, which can cause confusion.

Fix x25_listen() to return -EINVAL if the socket has
already been successfully connect()ed to avoid this issue.

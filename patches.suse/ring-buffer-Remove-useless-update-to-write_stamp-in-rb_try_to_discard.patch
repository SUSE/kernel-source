Subject: ring-buffer: Remove useless update to write_stamp in
 rb_try_to_discard()
Git-commit: 083e9f65bd215582bf8f6a920db729fadf16704f
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc6
References: git-fixes

When filtering is enabled, a temporary buffer is created to place the
content of the trace event output so that the filter logic can decide
from the trace event output if the trace event should be filtered out or
not. If it is to be filtered out, the content in the temporary buffer is
simply discarded, otherwise it is written into the trace buffer.

But if an interrupt were to come in while a previous event was using that
temporary buffer, the event written by the interrupt would actually go
into the ring buffer itself to prevent corrupting the data on the
temporary buffer. If the event is to be filtered out, the event in the
ring buffer is discarded, or if it fails to discard because another event
were to have already come in, it is turned into padding.

The update to the write_stamp in the rb_try_to_discard() happens after a
fix was made to force the next event after the discard to use an absolute
timestamp by setting the before_stamp to zero so it does not match the
write_stamp (which causes an event to use the absolute timestamp).

But there's an effort in rb_try_to_discard() to put back the write_stamp
to what it was before the event was added. But this is useless and
wasteful because nothing is going to be using that write_stamp for
calculations as it still will not match the before_stamp.

Remove this useless update, and in doing so, we remove another
cmpxchg64()!

Also update the comments to reflect this change as well as remove some
extra white space in another comment.

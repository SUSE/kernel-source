Subject: [PATCH] tty: n_gsm: fix NULL pointer access due to DLCI release
Git-commit: 96b169f05cdcc844b400695184d77e42071d14f2
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc6
References: git-fixes

The here fixed commit made the tty hangup asynchronous to avoid a circular
locking warning. I could not reproduce this warning. Furthermore, due to
the asynchronous hangup the function call now gets queued up while the
underlying tty is being freed. Depending on the timing this results in a
NULL pointer access in the global work queue scheduler. To be precise in
process_one_work(). Therefore, the previous commit made the issue worse
which it tried to fix.

This patch fixes this by falling back to the old behavior which uses a
blocking tty hangup call before freeing up the associated tty.

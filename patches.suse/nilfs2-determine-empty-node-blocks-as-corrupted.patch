Subject: [PATCH] nilfs2: determine empty node blocks as corrupted
Git-commit: 111b812d3662f3a1b831d19208f83aa711583fe6
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

Due to the nature of b-trees, nilfs2 itself and admin tools such as
mkfs.nilfs2 will never create an intermediate b-tree node block with 0
child nodes, nor will they delete (key, pointer)-entries that would result
in such a state.  However, it is possible that a b-tree node block is
corrupted on the backing device and is read with 0 child nodes.

Because operation is not guaranteed if the number of child nodes is 0 for
intermediate node blocks other than the root node, modify
nilfs_btree_node_broken(), which performs sanity checks when reading a
b-tree node block, so that such cases will be judged as metadata
corruption.

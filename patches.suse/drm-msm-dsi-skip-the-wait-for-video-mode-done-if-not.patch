Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dsi: skip the wait for video mode done if not applicable
Git-commit: ab483e3adcc178254eb1ce0fbdfbea65f86f1006
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc6
References: git-fixes

dsi_wait4video_done() API waits for the DSI video mode engine to
become idle so that we can transmit the DCS commands in the
beginning of BLLP. However, with the current sequence, the MDP
timing engine is turned on after the panel's pre_enable() callback
which can send out the DCS commands needed to power up the panel.

During those cases, this API will always timeout and print out the
error spam leading to long bootup times and log flooding.

Fix this by checking if the DSI video engine was actually busy before
waiting for it to become idle otherwise this is a redundant wait.

changes in v2:
	- move the reg read below the video mode check
	- minor fixes in commit text

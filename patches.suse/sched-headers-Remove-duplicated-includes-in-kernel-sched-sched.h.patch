Subject: [PATCH] sched/headers: Remove duplicated includes in
 kernel/sched/sched.h

References: bsc#1212887 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: 7ad0354d18ae05e9c8885251e234cbcf141f8972
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1

Remove duplicated includes of linux/cgroup.h and linux/psi.h. Both of
these includes are included regardless of the config and they are all
protected by ifndef, so no point including them again.

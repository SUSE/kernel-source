Subject: drm/atomic-helper: Change parameter name of
 drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_dependencies()
Git-commit: c0a98824fe5be4b7c7f3323e840928bc6eeb618e
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_dependencies() waits for all the dependencies
a commit has before going forward with it. It takes the drm_atomic_state
being committed as a parameter.

However, that parameter name is called (and documented) as old_state,
which is pretty confusing. Let's rename that variable as state.

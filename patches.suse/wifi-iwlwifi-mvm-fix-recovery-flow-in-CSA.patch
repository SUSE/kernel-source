Subject: [PATCH] wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix recovery flow in CSA
Git-commit: 828c79d9feb000acbd9c15bd1ed7e0914473b363
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

If the firmware crashes in the de-activation / re-activation
of the link during CSA, we will not have a valid phy_ctxt
pointer in mvmvif. This is a legit case, but when mac80211
removes the station to cleanup our state during the
re-configuration, we need to make sure we clear ap_sta
otherwise we won't re-add the station after the firmware has
been restarted. Later on, we'd activate the link, try to send
a TLC command crash again on ASSERT 3508.

Fix this by properly cleaning up our state.

Subject: [PATCH] can: mcba_usb_start(): add missing urb->transfer_dma initialization
Git-commit: fc43fb69a7af92839551f99c1a96a37b77b3ae7a
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc4
References: git-fixes

Yasushi reported, that his Microchip CAN Analyzer stopped working
since commit 91c02557174b ("can: mcba_usb: fix memory leak in
mcba_usb"). The problem was in missing urb->transfer_dma
initialization.

In my previous patch to this driver I refactored mcba_usb_start() code
to avoid leaking usb coherent buffers. To archive it, I passed local
stack variable to usb_alloc_coherent() and then saved it to private
array to correctly free all coherent buffers on ->close() call. But I
forgot to initialize urb->transfer_dma with variable passed to
usb_alloc_coherent().

All of this was causing device to not work, since dma addr 0 is not
valid and following log can be found on bug report page, which points
exactly to problem described above.

| DMAR: [DMA Write] Request device [00:14.0] PASID ffffffff fault addr 0 [fault reason 05] PTE Write access is not set

This refixes:

    commit 7da17624e7948d5d9660b910f8079d26d26ce453
    nt: usb: USB_RTL8153_ECM should not default to y

    In general, device drivers should not be enabled by default.

which basically broke the commit it claimed to fix, ie:

    commit 657bc1d10bfc23ac06d5d687ce45826c760744f9
    r8153_ecm: avoid to be prior to r8152 driver

    Avoid r8153_ecm is compiled as built-in, if r8152 driver is compiled
    as modules. Otherwise, the r8153_ecm would be used, even though the
    device is supported by r8152 driver.

this commit amounted to:

Drivers/net/usb/kconfig: 

+config USB_RTL8153_ECM
+       tristate "RTL8153 ECM support"
+       depends on USB_NET_CDCETHER && (USB_RTL8152 || USB_RTL8152=n)
+       default y
+       help
+         This option supports ECM mode for RTL8153 ethernet adapter, when
+         CONFIG_USB_RTL8152 is not set, or the RTL8153 device is not
+         supported by r8152 driver.

Drivers/net/usb/makefile: 

-obj-$(CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER) += cdc_ether.o r8153_ecm.o
+obj-$(CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER) += cdc_ether.o
+obj-$(CONFIG_USB_RTL8153_ECM)  += r8153_ecm.o

And as can be seen it pulls a piece of the cdc_ether driver out into
a separate config option to be able to make this piece modular in case
cdc_ether is builtin, while r8152 is modular.

While in general, device drivers should indeed not be enabled by default:
this isn't a device driver per say, but rather this is support code for
the CDCETHER (ECM) driver, and should thus be enabled if it is enabled.

  And when we say "removed" we can just hide it from what's prompted
  to the user (whatever such internal options are called)? I believe
  this way we don't bring back Marek's complaint.

Side note: these incorrect defaults will result in Android 13
on 5.15 GKI kernels lacking USB_RTL8153_ECM support while having
USB_NET_CDCETHER (luckily we also have USB_RTL8150 and USB_RTL8152,
so it's probably only an issue for very new RTL815x hardware with
no native 5.15 driver).

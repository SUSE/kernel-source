Subject: drivers/nvme: Add quirks for device 126f:2262
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
Git-commit: e89086c43f0500bc7c4ce225495b73b8ce234c1f
References: git-fixes

This commit adds NVME_QUIRK_NO_DEEPEST_PS and NVME_QUIRK_BOGUS_NID for
device [126f:2262], which appears to be a generic VID:PID pair used for
many SSDs based on the Silicon Motion SM2262/SM2262EN controller.

Two of my SSDs with this VID:PID pair exhibit the same behavior:

  * They frequently have trouble exiting the deepest power state (5),
    resulting in the entire disk unresponsive.
    Verified by setting nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=10000 and
    observing them behaving normally.
  * They produce all-zero nguid and eui64 with `nvme id-ns` command.

The offending products are:

  * HP SSD EX950 1TB
  * HIKVISION C2000Pro 2TB

Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: intel: prevent pm_runtime resume prior to system suspend
Git-commit: 6d9f2dadba698114fed97b224578c5338a36b0d9
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

commit e38f9ff63e6d ("ACPI: scan: Do not add device IDs from _CID if _HID is not valid")
exposes a race condition on a TGL RVP device leading to a timeout.

The detailed analysis shows the RT711 codec driver scheduling a jack
detection workqueue while attaching during a spurious pm_runtime
resume, and the work function happens to be scheduled after the
manager device is suspended.

The direct link between this ACPI patch and a spurious pm_runtime
resume is not obvious; the most likely explanation is that a change in
the ACPI device linked list management modifies the order in which the
pm_runtime device status is checked and exposes a race condition that
was probably present for a very long time, but was not identified.

We already have a check in the .prepare stage, where we will resume to
full power from specific clock-stop modes. In all other cases, we
don't need to resume to full power by default. Adding the
SMART_SUSPEND flag prevents the spurious resume from happening.

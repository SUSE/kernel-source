Subject: tracing: Restructure trace_clock_global() to never block
Git-commit: aafe104aa9096827a429bc1358f8260ee565b7cc
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: git-fixes CVE-2021-46939 bsc#1220580

It was reported that a fix to the ring buffer recursion detection would
cause a hung machine when performing suspend / resume testing. The
following backtrace was extracted from debugging that case:

Call Trace:

With the following RIP:

RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x69/0x200

Since the fix to the recursion detection would allow a single recursion to
happen while tracing, this lead to the trace_clock_global() taking a spin
lock and then trying to take it again:

ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
  trace_clock_global() {
    arch_spin_lock() {
      queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {
        /* lock taken */
        (something else gets traced by function graph tracer)
          ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
            trace_clock_global() {
              arch_spin_lock() {
                queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {
                /* DEAD LOCK! */

Tracing should *never* block, as it can lead to strange lockups like the
above.

Restructure the trace_clock_global() code to instead of simply taking a
lock to update the recorded "prev_time" simply use it, as two events
happening on two different CPUs that calls this at the same time, really
doesn't matter which one goes first. Use a trylock to grab the lock for
updating the prev_time, and if it fails, simply try again the next time.
If it failed to be taken, that means something else is already updating
it.

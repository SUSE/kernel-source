Subject: [PATCH] docs: Update Schedstat version to 17

References: bsc#1234634 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Git-commit: 7c8cd569ff66755f17b0c0c03a9d8df1b6f3e9ed
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1

Update the Schedstat version to 17 as more fields are added to report
different kinds of imbalances in the sched domain. Also domain field
started printing corresponding domain name.

+Version 17 of schedstats removed 'lb_imbalance' field as it has no

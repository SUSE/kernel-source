Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: Clean up on enable failure
Git-commit: c32f1ebfd26bece77141257864ed7b4720da1557
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc5
References: git-fixes

If regulator_enable() fails, enable_count is incremented still.
A consumer, assuming no matching regulator_disable() is necessary on
failure, will then get this error message upon regulator_put()
since enable_count is non-zero:

    [    1.277418] WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 1 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2304 _regulator_put.part.0+0x168/0x170

The consumer could try to fix this in their driver by cleaning up on
error from regulator_enable() (i.e. call regulator_disable()), but that
results in the following since regulator_enable() failed and didn't
increment user_count:

    [    1.258112] unbalanced disables for vreg_l17c
    [    1.262606] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 1 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2899 _regulator_disable+0xd4/0x190

Fix this by decrementing enable_count upon failure to enable.

With this in place, just the reason for failure to enable is printed
as expected and developers can focus on the root cause of their issue
instead of thinking their usage of the regulator consumer api is
incorrect. For example, in my case:

    [    1.240426] vreg_l17c: invalid input voltage found

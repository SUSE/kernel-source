Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Query current VMCS when determining if MSR bitmaps are in use
Git-commit: 7dfbc624eb5726367900c8d86deff50836240361
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: stable-5.14.19

commit 7dfbc624eb5726367900c8d86deff50836240361 upstream.

Check the current VMCS controls to determine if an MSR write will be
intercepted due to MSR bitmaps being disabled.  In the nested VMX case,
KVM will disable MSR bitmaps in vmcs02 if they're disabled in vmcs12 or
if KVM can't map L1's bitmaps for whatever reason.

Note, the bad behavior is relatively benign in the current code base as
KVM sets all bits in vmcs02's MSR bitmap by default, clears bits if and
only if L0 KVM also disables interception of an MSR, and only uses the
buggy helper for MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL.  Because KVM explicitly tests WRMSR
before disabling interception of MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL, the flawed check
will only result in KVM reading MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL from hardware when it
isn't strictly necessary.

Tag the fix for stable in case a future fix wants to use
msr_write_intercepted(), in which case a buggy implementation in older
kernels could prove subtly problematic.

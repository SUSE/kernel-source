Subject: s390/vfio-ap: update docs to include dynamic config support
Git-commit: cb269e0aba7c3faef65a3b5d3a5be8b053f191a0
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: bsc#1205701

Update the documentation in vfio-ap.rst to include information about the
AP dynamic configuration support (e.g., hot plug of adapters, domains
and control domains via the matrix mediated device's sysfs assignment
attributes). This patch also makes a few minor tweaks to make corrections
and clarifications.

+Hot plug/unplug support:
+================
+An adapter, domain or control domain may be hot plugged into a running KVM
+guest by assigning it to the vfio_ap mediated device being used by the guest if
+the following conditions are met:
+
+* The adapter, domain or control domain must also be assigned to the host's
+  AP configuration.
+
+* Each APQN derived from the Cartesian product comprised of the APID of the
+  adapter being assigned and the APQIs of the domains assigned must reference a
+  queue device bound to the vfio_ap device driver.
+
+* To hot plug a domain, each APQN derived from the Cartesian product
+  comprised of the APQI of the domain being assigned and the APIDs of the
+  adapters assigned must reference a queue device bound to the vfio_ap device
+  driver.
+
+An adapter, domain or control domain may be hot unplugged from a running KVM
+guest by unassigning it from the vfio_ap mediated device being used by the
+guest.
+
+Over-provisioning of AP queues for a KVM guest:
+==============================================
+Over-provisioning is defined herein as the assignment of adapters or domains to
+a vfio_ap mediated device that do not reference AP devices in the host's AP
+configuration. The idea here is that when the adapter or domain becomes
+available, it will be automatically hot-plugged into the KVM guest using
+the vfio_ap mediated device to which it is assigned as long as each new APQN
+resulting from plugging it in references a queue device bound to the vfio_ap
+device driver.
+
 Limitations
 ===========
-* The KVM/kernel interfaces do not provide a way to prevent restoring an APQN
-  to the default drivers pool of a queue that is still assigned to a mediated
-  device in use by a guest. It is incumbent upon the administrator to
-  ensure there is no mediated device in use by a guest to which the APQN is
-  assigned lest the host be given access to the private data of the AP queue
-  device such as a private key configured specifically for the guest.
+Live guest migration is not supported for guests using AP devices without
+intervention by a system administrator. Before a KVM guest can be migrated,
+the vfio_ap mediated device must be removed. Unfortunately, it can not be
+removed manually (i.e., echo 1 > /sys/devices/vfio_ap/matrix/$UUID/remove) while
+the mdev is in use by a KVM guest. If the guest is being emulated by QEMU,
+its mdev can be hot unplugged from the guest in one of two ways:
+
+1. If the KVM guest was started with libvirt, you can hot unplug the mdev via
+   the following commands:
+
+      virsh detach-device <guestname> <path-to-device-xml>
+
+      For example, to hot unplug mdev 62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804 from
+      the guest named 'my-guest':
+
+         virsh detach-device my-guest ~/config/my-guest-hostdev.xml
+
+            The contents of my-guest-hostdev.xml:
+
+            <hostdev mode='subsystem' type='mdev' managed='no' model='vfio-ap'>
+              <source>
+                <address uuid='62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804'/>
+              </source>
+            </hostdev>
+
+
+      virsh qemu-monitor-command <guest-name> --hmp "device-del <device-id>"
+
+      For example, to hot unplug the vfio_ap mediated device identified on the
+      qemu command line with 'id=hostdev0' from the guest named 'my-guest':
+
+         virsh qemu-monitor-command my-guest --hmp "device_del hostdev0"
+
+2. A vfio_ap mediated device can be hot unplugged by attaching the qemu monitor
+   to the guest and using the following qemu monitor command:
+
+      (QEMU) device-del id=<device-id>
+
+      For example, to hot unplug the vfio_ap mediated device that was specified
+      on the qemu command line with 'id=hostdev0' when the guest was started:
+
+         (QEMU) device-del id=hostdev0
+
+After live migration of the KVM guest completes, an AP configuration can be
+restored to the KVM guest by hot plugging a vfio_ap mediated device on the target
+system into the guest in one of two ways:
+
+1. If the KVM guest was started with libvirt, you can hot plug a matrix mediated
+   device into the guest via the following virsh commands:
+
+   virsh attach-device <guestname> <path-to-device-xml>
+
+      For example, to hot plug mdev 62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804 into
+      the guest named 'my-guest':
+
+         virsh attach-device my-guest ~/config/my-guest-hostdev.xml
+
+            The contents of my-guest-hostdev.xml:
+
+            <hostdev mode='subsystem' type='mdev' managed='no' model='vfio-ap'>
+              <source>
+                <address uuid='62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804'/>
+              </source>
+            </hostdev>
+
+
+   virsh qemu-monitor-command <guest-name> --hmp \
+   "device_add vfio-ap,sysfsdev=<path-to-mdev>,id=<device-id>"
+
+      For example, to hot plug the vfio_ap mediated device
+      62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804 into the guest named 'my-guest' with
+      device-id hostdev0:

+
+2. A vfio_ap mediated device can be hot plugged by attaching the qemu monitor

+      (qemu) device_add "vfio-ap,sysfsdev=<path-to-mdev>,id=<device-id>"

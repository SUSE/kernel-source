Subject: [PATCH] cifs: remove redundant assignment to the variable match
Git-commit: 2f57e4464cddfceda850ae4224779d11b6eb171f
References: bsc#1193629
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc4

The variable match is being assigned a value that is never read, it
is being re-assigned a new value later on. The assignment is redundant
and can be removed.

Cleans up clang scan-build warning:
fs/cifs/dfs_cache.c:1302:2: warning: Value stored to 'match' is never read

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: exynos: add missing HDMI supplies on SMDK5250
Git-commit: 60a9914cb2061ba612a3f14f6ad329912b486360
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Add required VDD supplies to HDMI block on SMDK5250.  Without them, the
HDMI driver won't probe.  Because of lack of schematics, use same
supplies as on Arndale 5250 board (voltage matches).

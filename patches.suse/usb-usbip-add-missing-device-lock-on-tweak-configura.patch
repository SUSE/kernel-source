Subject: [PATCH] usb: usbip: add missing device lock on tweak configuration cmd
Git-commit: d088fabace2ca337b275d1d4b36db4fe7771e44f
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

The function documentation of usb_set_configuration says that its
callers should hold the device lock. This lock is held for all
callsites except tweak_set_configuration_cmd. The code path can be
executed for example when attaching a remote USB device.
The solution is to surround the call by the device lock.

This bug was found using my experimental own-developed static analysis
tool, which reported the missing lock on v5.17.2. I manually verified
this bug report by doing code review as well. I runtime checked that
the required lock is not held. I compiled and runtime tested this on
x86_64 with a USB mouse. After applying this patch, my analyser no
longer reports this potential bug.

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ACPI: PM: Block ASUS B1400CEAE from suspend to idle by default"
Git-commit: cb98555fcd8eee98c30165537c7e394f3a66e809
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: stable-fixes

This reverts commit d52848620de00cde4a3a5df908e231b8c8868250, which was
originally put in place to work around a s2idle failure on this platform
where the NVMe device was inaccessible upon resume.

After extended testing, we found that the firmware's implementation of S3
is buggy and intermittently fails to wake up the system. We need to revert
to s2idle mode.

The NVMe issue has now been solved more precisely in the commit titled
"pci: Disable D3cold on Asus B1400 PCI-NVMe bridge"

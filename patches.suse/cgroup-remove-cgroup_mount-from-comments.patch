Subject: [PATCH] cgroup: remove cgroup_mount from comments

References: bsc#1190050 (Cgroup functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
Git-commit: 1f8c543f142942a2325e729fc4c64b6898749c3a

Git rid of an outdated comment.

Since cgroup was fully switched to fs_context, cgroup_mount() is gone and
it's confusing to mention in comments of cgroup_kill_sb(). Delete it.

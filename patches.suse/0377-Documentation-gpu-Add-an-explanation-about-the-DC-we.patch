This commit introduces some explanation about the display team
validation.

Changes since V1:
- Remove unprecise information about the DC process for now, can be
  added later on.
- Jani: Fix bullets

 AMD display engine is partially shared with other operating systems; for this
 reason, our Display Core Driver is divided into two pieces:

+DC Code validation
+------------------
+
+Maintaining the same code base across multiple OSes requires a lot of
+synchronization effort between repositories and exhaustive validation. In the
+DC case, we maintain a tree to centralize code from different parts. The shared
+repository has integration tests with our Internal Linux CI farm, and we run a
+comprehensive set of IGT tests in various AMD GPUs/APUs (mostly recent dGPUs
+and APUs). Our CI also checks ARM64/32, PPC64/32, and x86_64/32 compilation
+with DCN enabled and disabled.
+
+When we upstream a new feature or some patches, we pack them in a patchset with
+the prefix **DC Patches for <DATE>**, which is created based on the latest
+`amd-staging-drm-next <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/agd5f/linux>`_. All of
+those patches are under a DC version tested as follows:
+
+* Ensure that every patch compiles and the entire series pass our set of IGT
+  test in different hardware.
+* Prepare a branch with those patches for our validation team. If there is an
+  error, a developer will debug as fast as possible; usually, a simple bisect
+  in the series is enough to point to a bad change, and two possible actions
+  emerge: fix the issue or drop the patch. If it is not an easy fix, the bad
+  patch is dropped.
+* Finally, developers wait a few days for community feedback before we merge
+  the series.
+
+It is good to stress that the test phase is something that we take extremely
+seriously, and we never merge anything that fails our validation. Follows an
+overview of our test set:
+
+#. Manual test
+    * Multiple Hotplugs with DP and HDMI.
+    * Stress test with multiple display configuration changes via the user interface.
+    * Validate VRR behaviour.
+    * Check PSR.
+    * Validate MPO when playing video.
+    * Test more than two displays connected at the same time.
+    * Check suspend/resume.
+    * Validate FPO.
+    * Check MST.
+#. Automated test
+    * IGT tests in a farm with GPUs and APUs that support DCN and DCE.
+    * Compilation validation with the latest GCC and Clang from LTS distro.
+    * Cross-compilation for PowerPC 64/32, ARM 64/32, and x86 32.
+
+In terms of test setup for CI and manual tests, we usually use:
+
+#. The latest Ubuntu LTS.
+#. In terms of userspace, we only use fully updated open-source components
+   provided by the distribution official package manager.
+#. Regarding IGT, we use the latest code from the upstream.
+#. Most of the manual tests are conducted in the GNome but we also use KDE.
+
+Notice that someone from our test team will always reply to the cover letter
+with the test report.

+DC Information

 The display pipe is responsible for "scanning out" a rendered frame from the
 GPU memory (also called VRAM, FrameBuffer, etc.) to a display. In other words,
 it would:
 
-1. Read frame information from memory;
-2. Perform required transformation;
-3. Send pixel data to sink devices.

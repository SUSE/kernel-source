Subject: [PATCH] block: assign bi_bdev for cloned bios in blk_rq_prep_clone
Git-commit: fd9f4e62a39f09a7c014d7415c2b9d1390aa0504
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsc#1198016

bio_clone_fast() sets the cloned bio to have the same ->bi_bdev as the
source bio. This means that when request-based dm called setup_clone(),
the cloned bio had its ->bi_bdev pointing to the dm device. After Commit
0b6e522cdc4a ("blk-mq: use ->bi_bdev for I/O accounting")
__blk_account_io_start() started using the request's ->bio->bi_bdev for
I/O accounting, if it was set. This caused IO going to the underlying
devices to use the dm device for their I/O accounting.

Set up the proper ->bi_bdev in blk_rq_prep_clone based on the whole
device bdev for the queue the request is cloned onto.

Fixes: 0b6e522cdc4a ("blk-mq: use ->bi_bdev for I/O accounting")

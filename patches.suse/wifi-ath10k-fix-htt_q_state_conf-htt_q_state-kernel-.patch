Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath10k: fix htt_q_state_conf & htt_q_state kernel-doc
Git-commit: 75dd17fdef110d99a2613d1284d2863cfc7cf6e9
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

Currently kernel-doc reports:
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/htt.h:1488: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct htt_q_state_conf '
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/htt.h:1542: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct htt_q_state '

Update the kernel-doc for these two structs to resolve the warnings.

No functional changes, compile tested only.

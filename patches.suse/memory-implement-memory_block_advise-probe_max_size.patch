Subject: memory: implement memory_block_advise/probe_max_size
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1

References: jsc#PED-14260

Patch series "memory,x86,acpi: hotplug memory alignment advisement", v8.

When physical address regions are not aligned to memory block size, the
misaligned portion is lost (stranded capacity).

Block size (min/max/selected) is architecture defined.  Most architectures
tend to use the minimum block size or some simplistic heurist.  On x86,
memory block size increases up to 2GB, and is otherwise fitted to the
alignment of non-hotplug (i.e.  not special purpose memory).

CXL exposes its memory for management through the ACPI CEDT (CXL Early
Detection Table) in a field called the CXL Fixed Memory Window.  Per the
CXL specification, this memory must be aligned to at least 256MB.

When a CFMW aligns on a size less than the block size, this causes a loss
of up to 2GB per CFMW on x86.  It is not uncommon for CFMW to be allocated
per-device - though this behavior is BIOS defined.

This patch set provides 3 things:
 1) implement advise/query functions in driverse/base/memory.c to
    report/query architecture agnostic hotplug block alignment advice.
 2) update x86 memblock size logic to consider the hotplug advice
 3) add code in acpi/numa/srat.c to report CFMW alignment advice

The advisement interfaces are design to be called during arch_init code
prior to allocator and smp_init.  start_kernel will call these through
setup_arch() (via acpi and mm/init_64.c on x86), which occurs prior to
mm_core_init and smp_init - so no need for atomics.

There's an attempt to signal callers to advise() that query has already
occurred, but this is predicated on the notion that query actually occurs
(which presently only happens on the x86 arch).  This is to assist
debugging future users.  Otherwise, the advise() call has been marked
__init to help static discovery of bad call times.

Once query is called the first time, it will always return the same value.

Interfaces return -EBUSY and 0 respectively on systems without hotplug.


This patch (of 3):

Hotplug memory sources may have opinions on what the memblock size should
be - usually for alignment purposes.  For example, CXL memory extents can
be 256MB with a matching alignment.  If this size/alignment is smaller
than the block size, it can result in stranded capacity.

Implement memory_block_advise_max_size for use prior to allocator init,
for software to advise the system on the max block size.

Implement memory_block_probe_max_size for use by arch init code to
calculate the best block size.  Use of advice is architecture defined.

The probe value can never change after first probe.  Calls to advise after
probe will return -EBUSY to aid debugging.

On systems without hotplug, always return -ENODEV and 0 respectively.

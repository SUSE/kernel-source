Subject: [PATCH] media: cec-adap.c: fix is_configuring state
Git-commit: 59267fc34f4900dcd2ec3295f6be04b79aee2186
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

If an adapter is trying to claim a free logical address then it is
in the 'is_configuring' state. If during that process the cable is
disconnected (HPD goes low, which in turn invalidates the physical
address), then cec_adap_unconfigure() is called, and that set the
is_configuring boolean to false, even though the thread that's
trying to claim an LA is still running.

Don't touch the is_configuring bool in cec_adap_unconfigure(), it
will eventually be cleared by the thread. By making that change
the cec_config_log_addr() function also had to change: it was
aborting if is_configuring became false (since that is what
cec_adap_unconfigure() did), but that no longer works. Instead
check if the physical address is invalid. That is a much
more appropriate check anyway.

This fixes a bug where the the adapter could be disabled even
though the device was still configuring. This could cause POLL
transmits to time out.

Subject: HID: core: remove one more kmemdup on .probe()
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
Git-commit: 7316fef4b993c4435f9fe55e7f2590baf25621ec
References: jsc#PED-14653

That last kmemdup while opening the report descriptor was required to
have a common kfree() on it.

Move that kmemdup in the only special case it's required (if there is a
.report_fixup()), and add a more elaborated check before freeing
hdev->rdesc, to avoid a double free.

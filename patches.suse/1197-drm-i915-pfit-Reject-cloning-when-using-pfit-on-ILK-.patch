Subject: drm/i915/pfit: Reject cloning when using pfit on ILK-BDW
Mime-version: 1.0

Git-commit: 07a3b10ff397d2f3f510a08bacb2ee8780167392
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

The panel fitter lives inside the pipe and so would affect all cloned
outputs. However the relevant properties (scaling mode, TV margins)
are per-connector so we could end up with a situation where each cloned
output wants a different pfit configuration. Let's just reject pfit
usage with cloning entirely.

Currently not an issue as we don't yet expose the TV margin
properties, but if/when we add those to HDMI we could end up
in this situation. For eDP/DP we don't support cloning anyyway.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: amd: yc: Revert "Fix non-functional mic on Lenovo 21J2"
Git-commit: 861b3415e4dee06cc00cd1754808a7827b9105bf
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: stable-fixes

This reverts commit ed00a6945dc32462c2d3744a3518d2316da66fcc,
which added a quirk entry to enable the Yellow Carp (YC)
driver for the Lenovo 21J2 laptop.

Although the microphone functioned with the YC driver, it
resulted in incorrect driver usage. The Lenovo 21J2 is not a
Yellow Carp platform, but a Pink Sardine platform, which
already has an upstreamed driver.

The microphone on the Lenovo 21J2 operates correctly with the
CONFIG_SND_SOC_AMD_PS flag enabled and does not require the
quirk entry. So this patch removes the quirk entry.

Thanks to Mukunda Vijendar [1] for pointing this out.

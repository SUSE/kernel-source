Subject: [PATCH] x86/vmscape: Warn when STIBP is disabled with SMT

Cross-thread attacks are generally harder as they require the victim to be
co-located on a core. However, with VMSCAPE the adversary targets belong to
the same guest execution, that are more likely to get co-located. In
particular, a thread that is currently executing userspace hypervisor
(after the IBPB) may still be targeted by a guest execution from a sibling
thread.

Issue a warning about the potential risk, except when:

- SMT is disabled
- STIBP is enabled system-wide
- Intel eIBRS is enabled (which implies STIBP protection)

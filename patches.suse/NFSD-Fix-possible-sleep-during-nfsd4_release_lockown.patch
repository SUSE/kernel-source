Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: Fix possible sleep during nfsd4_release_lockowner()
Git-commit: ce3c4ad7f4ce5db7b4f08a1e237d8dd94b39180b
Patch-mainline: v5.19
References: git-fixes

nfsd4_release_lockowner() holds clp->cl_lock when it calls
check_for_locks(). However, check_for_locks() calls nfsd_file_get()
/ nfsd_file_put() to access the backing inode's flc_posix list, and
nfsd_file_put() can sleep if the inode was recently removed.

Let's instead rely on the stateowner's reference count to gate
whether the release is permitted. This should be a reliable
indication of locks-in-use since file lock operations and
->lm_get_owner take appropriate references, which are released
appropriately when file locks are removed.

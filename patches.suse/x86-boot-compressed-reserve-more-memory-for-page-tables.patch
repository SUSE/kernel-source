Subject: x86/boot/compressed: Reserve more memory for page tables
Git-commit: f530ee95b72e77b09c141c4b1a4b94d1199ffbd9
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc2
References: git-fixes

The decompressor has a hard limit on the number of page tables it can
allocate. This limit is defined at compile-time and will cause boot
failure if it is reached.

The kernel is very strict and calculates the limit precisely for the
worst-case scenario based on the current configuration. However, it is
easy to forget to adjust the limit when a new use-case arises. The
worst-case scenario is rarely encountered during sanity checks.

In the case of enabling 5-level paging, a use-case was overlooked. The
limit needs to be increased by one to accommodate the additional level.
This oversight went unnoticed until Aaron attempted to run the kernel
via kexec with 5-level paging and unaccepted memory enabled.

Update wost-case calculations to include 5-level paging.

To address this issue, let's allocate some extra space for page tables.
128K should be sufficient for any use-case. The logic can be simplified
by using a single value for all kernel configurations.

[ Also add a warning, should this memory run low - by Dave Hansen. ]

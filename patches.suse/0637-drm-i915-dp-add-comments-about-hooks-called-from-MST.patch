Subject: drm/i915/dp: add comments about hooks called from MST stream encoders
Git-commit: 91daf92d9da10c87cb3c4310ba60b8edfde29515
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499

It would be best to have self-explanatory code, but lacking that, add
some comments about the way the DDI encoder hooks get called from DP MST
stream encoders.

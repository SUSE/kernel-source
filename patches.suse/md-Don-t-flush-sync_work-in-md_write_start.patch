Subject: md: Don't flush sync_work in md_write_start()
Git-commit: 86ad4cda79e0dade87d4bb0d32e1fe541d4a63e8
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

Because flush sync_work may trigger mddev_suspend() if there are spares,
and this should never be done in IO path because mddev_suspend() is used
to wait for IO.

This problem is found by code review.

Fixes: bc08041b32ab ("md: suspend array in md_start_sync() if array need reconfiguration")

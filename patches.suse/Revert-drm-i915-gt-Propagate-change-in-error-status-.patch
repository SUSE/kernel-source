Subject: [PATCH] Revert "drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error status to children on unhold"
Git-commit: ac653dd7996edf1770959e11a078312928bd7315
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: stable-5.14.17

commit ac653dd7996edf1770959e11a078312928bd7315 upstream.

Propagating errors to dependent fences is broken and can lead to errors
from one client ending up in another. In commit 3761baae908a ("Revert
"drm/i915: Propagate errors on awaiting already signaled fences""), we
attempted to get rid of fence error propagation but missed the case
added in commit 8e9f84cf5cac ("drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error
status to children on unhold"). Revert that one too. This error was
found by an up-and-coming selftest which triggers a reset during
request cancellation and verifies that subsequent requests complete
successfully.

V2: (Daniel Vetter)  - Use revert
V3: (Jason)  - Update commit message

v4 (Daniele):
 - fix checkpatch error in commit message.

Subject: [PATCH] power: supply: bq27xxx: fix error return in case of no bq27000 hdq battery
Git-commit: 2c334d038466ac509468fbe06905a32d202117db
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc7
References: git-fixes

Since commit

	commit f16d9fb6cf03 ("power: supply: bq27xxx: Retrieve again when busy")

the console log of some devices with hdq enabled but no bq27000 battery
(like e.g. the Pandaboard) is flooded with messages like:

[   34.247833] power_supply bq27000-battery: driver failed to report 'status' property: -1

as soon as user-space is finding a /sys entry and trying to read the
"status" property.

It turns out that the offending commit changes the logic to now return the
value of cache.flags if it is <0. This is likely under the assumption that
it is an error number. In normal errors from bq27xxx_read() this is indeed
the case.

But there is special code to detect if no bq27000 is installed or accessible
through hdq/1wire and wants to report this. In that case, the cache.flags
are set historically by

	commit 3dd843e1c26a ("bq27000: report missing device better.")

to constant -1 which did make reading properties return -ENODEV. So everything
appeared to be fine before the return value was passed upwards.

Now the -1 is returned as -EPERM instead of -ENODEV, triggering the error
condition in power_supply_format_property() which then floods the console log.

So we change the detection of missing bq27000 battery to simply set

	cache.flags = -ENODEV

instead of -1.

Subject: [PATCH] Docs/admin-guide/mm/damon/usage: fix wrong example of DAMOS filter matching sysfs file
Git-commit: da2a061888883e067e8e649d086df35c92c760a7
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

The example usage of DAMOS filter sysfs files, specifically the part of
'matching' file writing for memcg type filter, is wrong.  The intention is
to exclude pages of a memcg that already getting enough care from a given
scheme, but the example is setting the filter to apply the scheme to only
the pages of the memcg.  Fix it.

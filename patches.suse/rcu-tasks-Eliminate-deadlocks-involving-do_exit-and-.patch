Subject: [PATCH] rcu-tasks: Eliminate deadlocks involving do_exit() and RCU
 tasks
Git-commit: 1612160b91272f5b1596f499584d6064bf5be794
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1246298

Holding a mutex across synchronize_rcu_tasks() and acquiring
that same mutex in code called from do_exit() after its call to
exit_tasks_rcu_start() but before its call to exit_tasks_rcu_stop()
results in deadlock.  This is by design, because tasks that are far
enough into do_exit() are no longer present on the tasks list, making
it a bit difficult for RCU Tasks to find them, let alone wait on them
to do a voluntary context switch.  However, such deadlocks are becoming
more frequent.  In addition, lockdep currently does not detect such
deadlocks and they can be difficult to reproduce.

In addition, if a task voluntarily context switches during that time
(for example, if it blocks acquiring a mutex), then this task is in an
RCU Tasks quiescent state.  And with some adjustments, RCU Tasks could
just as well take advantage of that fact.

This commit therefore eliminates these deadlock by replacing the
SRCU-based wait for do_exit() completion with per-CPU lists of tasks
currently exiting.  A given task will be on one of these per-CPU lists for
the same period of time that this task would previously have been in the
previous SRCU read-side critical section.  These lists enable RCU Tasks
to find the tasks that have already been removed from the tasks list,
but that must nevertheless be waited upon.

The RCU Tasks grace period gathers any of these do_exit() tasks that it
must wait on, and adds them to the list of holdouts.  Per-CPU locking
and get_task_struct() are used to synchronize addition to and removal
from these lists.

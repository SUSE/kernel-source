Subject: bpf: Fix verifier log for async callback return values
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc6
Git-commit: 829955981c557c7fc7416581c4cd68a8a0c28620
References: jsc#PED-6811

The verifier, as part of check_return_code(), verifies that async
callbacks such as from e.g. timers, will return 0. It does this by
correctly checking that R0->var_off is in tnum_const(0), which
effectively checks that it's in a range of 0. If this condition fails,
however, it prints an error message which says that the value should
have been in (0x0; 0x1). This results in possibly confusing output such
as the following in which an async callback returns 1:

  At async callback the register R0 has value (0x1; 0x0) should have been in (0x0; 0x1)

The fix is easy -- we should just pass the tnum_const(0) as the correct
range to verbose_invalid_scalar(), which will then print the following:

  At async callback the register R0 has value (0x1; 0x0) should have been in (0x0; 0x0)

Fixes: bfc6bb74e4f1 ("bpf: Implement verifier support for validation of async callbacks.")

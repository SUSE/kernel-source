Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: do not stop transmitting phy test pattern during DP phy compliance test
Git-commit: 2788b4efa60c1e03ac10a156f3fdbd3be0f9198c
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

At normal operation, transmit phy test pattern has to be terminated before
DP controller switch to video ready state. However during phy compliance
testing, transmit phy test pattern should not be terminated until end of
compliance test which usually indicated by unplugged interrupt.

Only stop sending the train pattern in dp_ctrl_on_stream() if we're not
doing compliance testing. We also no longer reset 'p_level' and
'v_level' within dp_ctrl_on_link() due to both 'p_level' and 'v_level'
are acquired from link status at previous dpcd read and we like to use
those level to start link training.

Changes in v2:
-- add more details commit text
-- correct Fixes

Changes in v3:
-- drop unnecessary braces

Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (lm90) Reduce maximum conversion rate for G781
Git-commit: a66c5ed539277b9f2363bbace0dba88b85b36c26
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc2
References: git-fixes

According to its datasheet, G781 supports a maximum conversion rate value
of 8 (62.5 ms). However, chips labeled G781 and G780 were found to only
support a maximum conversion rate value of 7 (125 ms). On the other side,
chips labeled G781-1 and G784 were found to support a conversion rate value
of 8. There is no known means to distinguish G780 from G781 or G784; all
chips report the same manufacturer ID and chip revision.
Setting the conversion rate register value to 8 on chips not supporting
it causes unexpected behavior since the real conversion rate is set to 0
(16 seconds) if a value of 8 is written into the conversion rate register.
Limit the conversion rate register value to 7 for all G78x chips to avoid
the problem.

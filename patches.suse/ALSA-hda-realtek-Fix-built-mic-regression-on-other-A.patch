Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix built-mic regression on other ASUS models
Git-commit: 4d5b71b487291da9f92e352c0a7e39f256d60db8
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc5
References: git-fixes

A few ASUS models use the ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_HEADSET_MODE although they
have no built-in mic pin on NID 0x13, as found in the commit
c1732ede5e80 ("ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix headset and mic on several Asus
laptops with ALC256").  This was relatively harmless in the past as
NID 0x13 was assigned as the secondary mic.  But since the fix for the
pin sort order, this pin became the primary one, hence user started
noticing the broken input, and we've fixed already for a few ASUS
models to switch to ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC_NO_PRESENCE.

This patch corrects the other ASUS models to use the right quirk entry
for fixing the built-in mic regression.  Here we cover X541SA
(1043:12e0), X541UV (1043:12f0), Z550SA (1043:13bf0) and X555UB
(1043:1ccd).

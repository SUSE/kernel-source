Subject: perf vendor events intel: Update sandybridge TMA metrics to 4.7
Git-commit: 176e66715d0ea5ccf65b36b411d760ab18a0de4a
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: perf-sp7-v6.11-userspace-update

Top-Down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMA) metrics simplify
cycle-accounting using microarchitecture-abstracted metrics
organized in one hierarchy. This update is from version 4.5 to
4.7.

The update includes:

 - Add metrics tma_fp_vector_128b, tma_fp_vector_256b and
   tma_info_system_cpus_utilized.
 - Remove metrics tma_info_system_mem_parallel_requests,
   tma_info_system_core_frequency and
   tma_info_system_mem_request_latency.
 - Swapped tma_info_core_ilp (becomes per SMT thread) and
   tma_info_pipeline_execute (per physical core).
 - Tuned thresholds for tma_fetch_bandwidth.

The update came from:

https://github.com/intel/perfmon/pull/140
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/pull/138

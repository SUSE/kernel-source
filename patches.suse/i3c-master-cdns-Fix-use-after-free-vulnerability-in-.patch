Subject: [PATCH] i3c: master: cdns: Fix use after free vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition
Git-commit: 609366e7a06d035990df78f1562291c3bf0d4a12
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: CVE-2024-50061 bsc#1232263

In the cdns_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with
cdns_i3c_master_hj. And cdns_i3c_master_interrupt can call
cnds_i3c_master_demux_ibis function to start the work.

If we remove the module which will call cdns_i3c_master_remove to
make cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister
while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations
that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                      CPU1

                                     | cdns_i3c_master_hj
cdns_i3c_master_remove               |
i3c_master_unregister(&master->base) |
device_unregister(&master->dev)      |
device_release                       |
//free master->base                  |
                                     | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)
                                     | //use master->base

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with
the cleanup in cdns_i3c_master_remove.

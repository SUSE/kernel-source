Subject: x86/cpufeatures: Add AMD Collaborative Processor Performance Control
 feature flag
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
Git-commit: d341db8f48ea43314f489921962c7f8f4ec27239
References: jsc#PED-1408

Add Collaborative Processor Performance Control feature flag for AMD
processors.

This feature flag will be used on the following AMD P-State driver. The
AMD P-State driver has two approaches to implement the frequency control
behavior. That depends on the CPU hardware implementation. One is "Full
MSR Support" and another is "Shared Memory Support". The feature flag
indicates the current processors with "Full MSR Support".

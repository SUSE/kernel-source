Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Fix Link TRB DMA in command ring stopped completion event
Git-commit: 075919f6df5dd82ad0b1894898b315fbb3c29b84
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc6
References: git-fixes

During the aborting of a command, the software receives a command
completion event for the command ring stopped, with the TRB pointing
to the next TRB after the aborted command.

If the command we abort is located just before the Link TRB in the
command ring, then during the 'command ring stopped' completion event,
the xHC gives the Link TRB in the event's cmd DMA, which causes a
mismatch in handling command completion event.

To address this situation, move the 'command ring stopped' completion
event check slightly earlier, since the specific command it stopped
on isn't of significant concern.

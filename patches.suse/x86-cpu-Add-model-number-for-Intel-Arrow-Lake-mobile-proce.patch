Subject: x86/cpu: Add model number for Intel Arrow Lake mobile processor
Git-commit: b99d70c0d1380f1368fd4a82271280c4fd28558b
Patch-mainline: v6.6
References: git-fixes

For "reasons" Intel has code-named this CPU with a "_H" suffix.

[ dhansen: As usual, apply this and send it upstream quickly to
	   make it easier for anyone who is doing work that
	   consumes this. ]

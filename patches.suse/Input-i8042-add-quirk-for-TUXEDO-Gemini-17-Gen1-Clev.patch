Subject: [PATCH] Input: i8042 - add quirk for TUXEDO Gemini 17 Gen1/Clevo
 PD70PN
Git-commit: eb09074bdb05ffd6bfe77f8b4a41b76ef78c997b
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc1

The touchpad of this device is both connected via PS/2 and i2c. This causes
strange behavior when both driver fight for control. The easy fix is to
prevent the PS/2 driver from accessing the mouse port as the full feature
set of the touchpad is only supported in the i2c interface anyway.

The strange behavior in this case is, that when an external screen is
connected and the notebook is closed, the pointer on the external screen is
moving to the lower right corner. When the notebook is opened again, this
movement stops, but the touchpad clicks are unresponsive afterwards until
reboot.

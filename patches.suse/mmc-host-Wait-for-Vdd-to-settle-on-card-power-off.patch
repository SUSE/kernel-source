Subject: [PATCH] mmc: host: Wait for Vdd to settle on card power off
Git-commit: 31e75ed964582257f59156ce6a42860e1ae4cc39
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: stable-fixes

The SD spec version 6.0 section 6.4.1.5 requires that Vdd must be
lowered to less than 0.5V for a minimum of 1 ms when powering off a
card. Increase wait to 15 ms so that voltage has time to drain down
to 0.5V and cards can power off correctly. Issues with voltage drain
time were only observed on Apollo Lake and Bay Trail host controllers
so this fix is limited to those devices.

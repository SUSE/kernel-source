Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: remove dead struct io_submit_state member
Git-commit: 26b97668e5339434e5df8ddc7b1898a37a350112
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc6
References: bsc#1230569

When the intermediate CQE aux cache got removed, any usage of the this
member went away. As it isn't used anymore, kill it.

Fixes: 902ce82c2aa1 ("io_uring: get rid of intermediate aux cqe caches")

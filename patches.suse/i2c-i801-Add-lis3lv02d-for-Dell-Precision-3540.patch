On the Dell Precision 3540/0M14W7, BIOS 1.7.4 05/12/2020, Linux prints
the warning below.

    i801_smbus 0000:00:1f.4: Accelerometer lis3lv02d is present on SMBus but its address is unknown, skipping registration

With the help of Wolfram Sang, the test to probe it on I2C bus 6 at address
0x29 was successful.

    $ echo lis3lv02d 0x29 | sudo tee /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-6/new_device
    [ 2110.787000] i2c i2c-6: new_device: Instantiated device lis3lv02d at 0x29
    [ 2110.791932] lis3lv02d_i2c 6-0029: supply Vdd not found, using dummy regulator
    [ 2110.791981] lis3lv02d_i2c 6-0029: supply Vdd_IO not found, using dummy regulator
    [ 2110.809233] lis3lv02d: 8 bits 3DC sensor found
    [ 2110.900668] input: ST LIS3LV02DL Accelerometer as /devices/platform/lis3lv02d/input/input23

So, the device has that accelerometer. Add the I2C address to the
mapping list.

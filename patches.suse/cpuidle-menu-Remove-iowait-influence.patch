Subject: [PATCH] cpuidle: menu: Remove iowait influence

References: bsc#1234634 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
Git-commit: 38f83090f515b4b5d59382dfada1e7457f19aa47

Remove CPU iowaiters influence on idle state selection.

Remove the menu notion of performance multiplier which increased with
the number of tasks that went to iowait sleep on this CPU and haven't
woken up yet.

Relying on iowait for cpuidle is problematic for a few reasons:

 1. There is no guarantee that an iowaiting task will wake up on the
    same CPU.

 2. The task being in iowait says nothing about the idle duration, we
    could be selecting shallower states for a long time.

 3. The task being in iowait doesn't always imply a performance hit
    with increased latency.

 4. If there is such a performance hit, the number of iowaiting tasks
    doesn't directly correlate.

 5. The definition of iowait altogether is vague at best, it is
    sprinkled across kernel code.

- * Limiting Performance Impact
- * ---------------------------
- * C states, especially those with large exit latencies, can have a real
- * noticeable impact on workloads, which is not acceptable for most sysadmins,
- * and in addition, less performance has a power price of its own.
- *
- * As a general rule of thumb, menu assumes that the following heuristic
- * holds:
- *     The busier the system, the less impact of C states is acceptable
- *
- * This rule-of-thumb is implemented using a performance-multiplier:
- * If the exit latency times the performance multiplier is longer than
- * the predicted duration, the C state is not considered a candidate
- * for selection due to a too high performance impact. So the higher
- * this multiplier is, the longer we need to be idle to pick a deep C
- * state, and thus the less likely a busy CPU will hit such a deep
- * C state.
- *
- * Currently there is only one value determining the factor:
- * 10 points are added for each process that is waiting for IO on this CPU.
- * (This value was experimentally determined.)
- * Utilization is no longer a factor as it was shown that it never contributed
- * significantly to the performance multiplier in the first place.

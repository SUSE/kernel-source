Subject: [PATCH] ibmvnic: Free rwi on reset success

References: bsc#1184350 ltc#191533 git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc4
Git-commit: d6dd2fe71153f0ff748bf188bd4af076fe09a0a6

Free the rwi structure in the event that the last rwi in the list
processed successfully. The logic in commit 4f408e1fa6e1 ("ibmvnic:
retry reset if there are no other resets") introduces an issue that
results in a 32 byte memory leak whenever the last rwi in the list
gets processed.

Fixes: 4f408e1fa6e1 ("ibmvnic: retry reset if there are no other resets")

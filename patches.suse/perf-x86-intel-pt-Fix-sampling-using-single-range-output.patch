Subject: perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix sampling using single range output
Git-commit: ce0d998be9274dd3a3d971cbeaa6fe28fd2c3062
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc6
References: git fixes

Deal with errata TGL052, ADL037 and RPL017 "Trace May Contain Incorrect
Data When Configured With Single Range Output Larger Than 4KB" by
disabling single range output whenever larger than 4KB.

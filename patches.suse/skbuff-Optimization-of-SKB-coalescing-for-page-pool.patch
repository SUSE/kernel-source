Subject: skbuff: Optimization of SKB coalescing for page pool
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
Git-commit: f7dc3248dcfbdd81b5be64272f38b87a8e8085e7
References: jsc#PED-11221

In order to address the issues encountered with commit 1effe8ca4e34
("skbuff: fix coalescing for page_pool fragment recycling"), the
combination of the following condition was excluded from skb coalescing:

from->pp_recycle = 1
from->cloned = 1
to->pp_recycle = 1

However, with page pool environments, the aforementioned combination can
be quite common(ex. NetworkMananger may lead to the additional
packet_type being registered, thus the cloning). In scenarios with a
higher number of small packets, it can significantly affect the success
rate of coalescing. For example, considering packets of 256 bytes size,
our comparison of coalescing success rate is as follows:

Without page pool: 70%
With page pool: 13%

Consequently, this has an impact on performance:

Without page pool: 2.57 Gbits/sec
With page pool: 2.26 Gbits/sec

Therefore, it seems worthwhile to optimize this scenario and enable
coalescing of this particular combination. To achieve this, we need to
ensure the correct increment of the "from" SKB page's page pool
reference count (pp_ref_count).

Following this optimization, the success rate of coalescing measured in
our environment has improved as follows:

With page pool: 60%

This success rate is approaching the rate achieved without using page
pool, and the performance has also been improved:

With page pool: 2.52 Gbits/sec

Below is the performance comparison for small packets before and after
this optimization. We observe no impact to packets larger than 4K.

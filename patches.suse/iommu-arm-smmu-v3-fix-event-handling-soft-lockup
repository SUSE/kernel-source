Subject: iommu/arm-smmu-v3: fix event handling soft lockup
Git-commit: 30de2b541af98179780054836b48825fcfba4408
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: bsc#1205701

During event processing, events are read from the event queue one
by one until the queue is empty.If the master device continuously
requests address access at the same time and the SMMU generates
events, the cyclic processing of the event takes a long time and
softlockup warnings may be reported.

arm-smmu-v3 arm-smmu-v3.34.auto: event 0x0a received:
arm-smmu-v3 arm-smmu-v3.34.auto: 	0x00007f220000280a

watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [irq/268-arm-smm:247]

Kernel panic - not syncing: softlockup: hung tasks

Fix this by calling cond_resched() after the event information is
printed.

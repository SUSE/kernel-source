Subject: [PATCH] soc: imx: Register SoC device only on i.MX boards
Git-commit: 4ebd29f91629e69da7d57390cdc953772eee03ab
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc6
References: git-fixes

At the moment, using the ARM32 multi_v7_defconfig always results in two
SoCs being exposed in sysfs. This is wrong, as far as I'm aware the
Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c does not actually make use of a i.MX SoC. :)

  qcom-db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ grep . *
  family:Freescale i.MX
  machine:Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. APQ 8016 SBC
  revision:0.0
  serial_number:0000000000000000
  soc_id:Unknown

  qcom-db410c:/sys/devices/soc1$ grep . *
  family:Snapdragon
  machine:APQ8016
  ...

This happens because imx_soc_device_init() registers the soc device
unconditionally, even when running on devices that do not make use of i.MX.
Arnd already reported this more than a year ago and even suggested a fix
similar to this commit, but for some reason it was never submitted.

Fix it by checking if the "__mxc_cpu_type" variable was actually
initialized by earlier platform code. On devices without i.MX it will
simply stay 0.

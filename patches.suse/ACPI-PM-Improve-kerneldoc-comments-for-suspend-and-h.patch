Subject: ACPI: PM: Improve kerneldoc comments for suspend and hibernation
 functions
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
Git-commit: d7ef570ae0bfd2375a7e7fe468fd6b1b306272c1
References: jsc#PED-11164

This patch enhances the documentation for the ACPI power management
functions related to system suspend and hibernation.

This includes the use of kernel-doc style comments which provide
developers with clearer guidance on the usage and expectations of
these functions.

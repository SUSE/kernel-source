Subject: KVM: nVMX: Consult only the "basic" exit reason when routing nested
 exit
Git-commit: 2ebac8bb3c2d35f5135466490fc8eeaf3f3e2d37
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc1
References: bsc#1188773

Consult only the basic exit reason, i.e. bits 15:0 of vmcs.EXIT_REASON,
when determining whether a nested VM-Exit should be reflected into L1 or
handled by KVM in L0.

For better or worse, the switch statement in nested_vmx_exit_reflected()
currently defaults to "true", i.e. reflects any nested VM-Exit without
dedicated logic.  Because the case statements only contain the basic
exit reason, any VM-Exit with modifier bits set will be reflected to L1,
even if KVM intended to handle it in L0.

Practically speaking, this only affects EXIT_REASON_MCE_DURING_VMENTRY,
i.e. a #MC that occurs on nested VM-Enter would be incorrectly routed to
L1, as "failed VM-Entry" is the only modifier that KVM can currently
encounter.  The SMM modifiers will never be generated as KVM doesn't
support/employ a SMI Transfer Monitor.  Ditto for "exit from enclave",
as KVM doesn't yet support virtualizing SGX, i.e. it's impossible to
enter an enclave in a KVM guest (L1 or L2).

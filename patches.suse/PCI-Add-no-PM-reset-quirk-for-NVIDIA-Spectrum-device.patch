Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Add no PM reset quirk for NVIDIA Spectrum devices
Git-commit: 3ed48c80b28d8dcd584d6ddaf00c75b7673e1a05
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

Spectrum-{1,2,3,4} devices report that a D3hot->D0 transition causes a
reset (i.e., they advertise NoSoftRst-). However, this transition does
not have any effect on the device: It continues to be operational and
network ports remain up. Advertising this support makes it seem as if a
PM reset is viable for these devices. Mark it as unavailable to skip it
when testing reset methods.

Before: 

 # cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:03\:00.0/reset_method
 pm bus

After: 

 # cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:03\:00.0/reset_method
 bus

Subject: random: check for signal_pending() outside of need_resched() check
Git-commit: 1448769c9cdb69ad65287f4f7ab58bc5f2f5d7ba
Patch-mainline: 5.18-rc2
References: git-fixes

signal_pending() checks TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL and TIF_SIGPENDING, which
signal that the task should bail out of the syscall when possible. This
is a separate concept from need_resched(), which checks
TIF_NEED_RESCHED, signaling that the task should preempt.

In particular, with the current code, the signal_pending() bailout
probably won't work reliably.

Change this to look like other functions that read lots of data, such as
read_zero().

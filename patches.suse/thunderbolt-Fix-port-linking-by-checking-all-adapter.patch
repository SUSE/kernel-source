Subject: [PATCH] thunderbolt: Fix port linking by checking all adapters
Git-commit: 42716425ad7e1b6529ec61c260c11176841f4b5f
References: jsc#SLE-19355
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1

In tb_switch_default_link_ports(), while linking of ports,
only odd-numbered ports (1,3,5..) are considered and even-numbered
ports are not considered.

AMD host router has lane adapters at 2 and 3 and link ports at adapter 2
is not considered due to which lane bonding gets disabled.

Hence added a fix such that all ports are considered during
linking of ports.

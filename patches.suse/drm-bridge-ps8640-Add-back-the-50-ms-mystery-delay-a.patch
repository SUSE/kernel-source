Subject: drm/bridge: ps8640: Add back the 50 ms mystery delay after HPD
Git-commit: cb8e30ddb7e345867f6f2da8a08291d7d9e037db
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc3
References: git-fixes

Back in commit 826cff3f7ebb ("drm/bridge: parade-ps8640: Enable
runtime power management") we removed a mysterious 50 ms delay because
"Parade's support [couldn't] explain what the delay [was] for".

While I'm always a fan of removing mysterious delays, I suspect that
we need this mysterious delay to avoid some problems.

Specifically, what I found recently is that on sc7180-trogdor-homestar
sometimes the AUX backlight wasn't initializing properly. Some
debugging showed that the drm_dp_dpcd_read() function that the AUX
backlight driver was calling was returning bogus data about 1% of the
time when I booted up. This confused
drm_panel_dp_aux_backlight(). From continued debugging:
- If I retried the read then the read worked just fine.
- If I added a loop to perform the same read that
  drm_panel_dp_aux_backlight() was doing 30 times at bootup I could
  see that some percentage of the time the first read would give bogus
  data but all 29 additional reads would always be fine.
- If I added a large delay _after_ powering on the panel but before
  powering on PS8640 I could still reproduce the problem.
- If I added a delay after PS8640 powered on then I couldn't reproduce
  the problem.
- I couldn't reproduce the problem on a board with the same panel but
  the ti-sn65dsi86 bridge chip.

To me, the above indicated that there was a problem with PS8640 and
not the panel.

I don't really have any insight into what's going on in the MCU, but
my best guess is that when the MCU itself sees the HPD go high that it
does some AUX transfers itself and this is confusing things.

Let's go back and add back in the mysterious 50 ms delay. We only want
to do this the first time we see HPD go high after booting the MCU,
not every time we double-check HPD.

With this, the backlight initializes reliably on homestar.

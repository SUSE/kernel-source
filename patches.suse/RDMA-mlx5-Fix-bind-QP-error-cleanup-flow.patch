Subject: [PATCH 1/1] RDMA/mlx5: Fix bind QP error cleanup flow
Git-commit: e1a0bdbdfdf08428f0ede5ae49c7f4139ac73ef5
Patch-mainline: v6.14 or v6.14-rc5 (next release)
References: git-fixes

When there is a failure during bind QP, the cleanup flow destroys the
counter regardless if it is the one that created it or not, which is
problematic since if it isn't the one that created it, that counter could
still be in use.

Fix that by destroying the counter only if it was created during this call.

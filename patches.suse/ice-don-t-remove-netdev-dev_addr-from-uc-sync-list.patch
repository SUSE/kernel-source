Subject: ice: don't remove netdev->dev_addr from uc sync list
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc6
Git-commit: 3ba7f53f8bf1fb862e36c7f74434ac3aceb60158
References: git-fixes

In some circumstances, such as with bridging, it's possible that the
stack will add the device's own MAC address to its unicast address list.

If, later, the stack deletes this address, the driver will receive a
request to remove this address.

The driver stores its current MAC address as part of the VSI MAC filter
list instead of separately. So, this causes a problem when the device's
MAC address is deleted unexpectedly, which results in traffic failure in
some cases.

The following configuration steps will reproduce the previously
mentioned problem:

> ip link set eth0 up
> ip link add dev br0 type bridge
> ip link set br0 up
> ip addr flush dev eth0
> ip link set eth0 master br0
> echo 1 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/vlan_filtering
> modprobe -r veth
> modprobe -r bridge
> ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0

The following ping command fails due to the netdev->dev_addr being
deleted when removing the bridge module.
> ping <link partner>

Fix this by making sure to not delete the netdev->dev_addr during MAC
address sync. After fixing this issue it was noticed that the
netdev_warn() in .set_mac was overly verbose, so make it at
netdev_dbg().

Also, there is a possibility of a race condition between .set_mac and
.set_rx_mode. Fix this by calling netif_addr_lock_bh() and
netif_addr_unlock_bh() on the device's netdev when the netdev->dev_addr
is going to be updated in .set_mac.

Subject: KVM: TDX: Fix list_add corruption during vcpu_load()
Git-commit: 1e3a825c9ec90f91ef61dc9cbda610d9ec887db8
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

During vCPU creation, a vCPU may be destroyed immediately after
kvm_arch_vcpu_create() (e.g., due to vCPU id confiliction). However, the
vcpu_load() inside kvm_arch_vcpu_create() may have associate the vCPU to
pCPU via "list_add(&tdx->cpu_list, &per_cpu(associated_tdvcpus, cpu))"
before invoking tdx_vcpu_free().

Though there's no need to invoke tdh_vp_flush() on the vCPU, failing to
dissociate the vCPU from pCPU (i.e., "list_del(&to_tdx(vcpu)->cpu_list)")
will cause list corruption of the per-pCPU list associated_tdvcpus.

Then, a later list_add() during vcpu_load() would detect list corruption
and print calltrace as shown below.

Dissociate a vCPU from its associated pCPU in tdx_vcpu_free() for the vCPUs
destroyed immediately after creation which must be in
VCPU_TD_STATE_UNINITIALIZED state.

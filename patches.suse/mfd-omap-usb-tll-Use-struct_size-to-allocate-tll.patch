Subject: [PATCH] mfd: omap-usb-tll: Use struct_size to allocate tll
Git-commit: 40176714c818b0b6a2ca8213cdb7654fbd49b742
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc1
References: git-fixes

Commit 16c2004d9e4d ("mfd: omap-usb-tll: Allocate driver data at once")
changed the memory allocation of 'tll' to consolidate it into a single
allocation, introducing an incorrect size calculation.

In particular, the allocation for the array of pointers was converted
into a single-pointer allocation.

The memory allocation used to occur in two steps:

tll = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(struct usbtll_omap), GFP_KERNEL);
tll->ch_clk = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(struct clk *) * tll->nch,
                           GFP_KERNEL);

And it turned that into the following allocation:

tll = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*tll) + sizeof(tll->ch_clk[nch]),
                   GFP_KERNEL);

sizeof(tll->ch_clk[nch]) returns the size of a single pointer instead of
the expected nch pointers.

This bug went unnoticed because the allocation size was small enough to
fit within the minimum size of a memory allocation for this particular
case [1].

The complete allocation can still be done at once with the struct_size
macro, which comes in handy for structures with a trailing flexible
array.

Fix the memory allocation to obtain the original size again.

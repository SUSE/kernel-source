Subject: [PATCH] selftests, bpf: Fix makefile dependencies on libbpf
Git-commit: d888eaac4fb1df30320bb1305a8f78efe86524c6
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc4
References: stable-5.14.10

[ Upstream commit d888eaac4fb1df30320bb1305a8f78efe86524c6 ]

When building bpf selftest with make -j, I'm randomly getting build failures
such as this one:

  In file included from progs/bpf_flow.c:19:
  [...]/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/tools/include/bpf/bpf_helpers.h:11:10: fatal error: 'bpf_helper_defs.h' file not found
  #include "bpf_helper_defs.h"
           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file that fails the build varies between runs but it's always in the
progs/ subdir.

The reason is a missing make dependency on libbpf for the .o files in
progs/. There was a dependency before commit 3ac2e20fba07e but that commit
removed it to prevent unneeded rebuilds. However, that only works if libbpf
has been built already; the 'wildcard' prerequisite does not trigger when
there's no bpf_helper_defs.h generated yet.

Keep the libbpf as an order-only prerequisite to satisfy both goals. It is
always built before the progs/ objects but it does not trigger unnecessary
rebuilds by itself.

Fixes: 3ac2e20fba07e ("selftests/bpf: BPF object files should depend only on libbpf headers")

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: usb-audio: Re-add ScratchAmp quirk entries
Git-commit: 03898691d42e0170e7d00f07cbe21ce0e9f3a8fa
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc3
References: git-fixes

At the code refactoring of USB-audio quirk handling, I assumed that
the quirk entries of Stanton ScratchAmp devices were only about the
device name, and moved them completely into the rename table.
But it seems that the device requires the quirk entry so that it's
probed by the driver itself.

This re-adds back the quirk entries of ScratchAmp, but in a
minimalistic manner.

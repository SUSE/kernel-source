Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: intel: Initialize clock stop timeout
Git-commit: 13c30a755847c7e804e1bf755e66e3ff7b7f9367
Patch-mainline: v6.1-rc5
References: bsc#1205507

The bus->clk_stop_timeout member is only initialized to a non-zero value
during the codec driver probe. This can lead to corner cases where this
value remains pegged at zero when the bus suspends, which results in an
endless loop in sdw_bus_wait_for_clk_prep_deprep().

Corner cases include configurations with no codecs described in the
firmware, or delays in probing codec drivers.

Initializing the default timeout to the smallest non-zero value avoid this
problem and allows for the existing logic to be preserved: the
bus->clk_stop_timeout is set as the maximum required by all codecs
connected on the bus.

Subject: arm64: rust: clean Rust 1.85.0 warning using softfloat target
Git-commit: 446a8351f160d65a1c5df7097f31c74102ed2bb1
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc3
References: git-fixes

Starting with Rust 1.85.0 (to be released 2025-02-20), `rustc` warns
[1] about disabling neon in the aarch64 hardfloat target:

    warning: target feature `neon` cannot be toggled with
             `-Ctarget-feature`: unsound on hard-float targets
             because it changes float ABI
      |
      = note: this was previously accepted by the compiler but
              is being phased out; it will become a hard error
              in a future release!
      = note: for more information, see issue #116344
              <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/116344>

Thus, instead, use the softfloat target instead.

While trying it out, I found that the kernel sanitizers were not enabled
for that built-in target [2]. Upstream Rust agreed to backport
the enablement for the current beta so that it is ready for
the 1.85.0 release [3] -- thanks!

However, that still means that before Rust 1.85.0, we cannot switch
since sanitizers could be in use. Thus conditionally do so.

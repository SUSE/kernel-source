Subject: [PATCH] clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN
 in the right userns
Git-commit: c28f922c9dcee0e4876a2c095939d77fe7e15116
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: CVE-2025-38499 bsc#1247976

[ Minor adaptation wrt return code and up_read(). ]

What we want is to verify there is that clone won't expose something
hidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo.  "Wouldn't be able to undo"
may be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come from
lacking admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.

clone_private_mnt() checks the former, but not the latter.

There's a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in various
userns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they serve
different purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually,
but not always end up covering the missing check mentioned above.

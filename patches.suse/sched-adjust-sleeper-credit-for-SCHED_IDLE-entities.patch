Subject: [PATCH] sched: adjust sleeper credit for SCHED_IDLE entities

References: bsc#1189999 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-commit: 2cae3948edd488ebdef4deaf1d1043f92f47e665
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git

Give reduced sleeper credit to SCHED_IDLE entities. As a result, woken
SCHED_IDLE entities will take longer to preempt normal entities.

The benefit of this change is to make it less likely that a newly woken
SCHED_IDLE entity will preempt a short-running normal entity before it
blocks.

We still give a small sleeper credit to SCHED_IDLE entities, so that
idle<->idle competition retains some fairness.

Example: With HZ=1000, spawned four threads affined to one cpu, one of
which was set to SCHED_IDLE. Without this patch, wakeup latency for the
SCHED_IDLE thread was ~1-2ms, with the patch the wakeup latency was
~5ms.

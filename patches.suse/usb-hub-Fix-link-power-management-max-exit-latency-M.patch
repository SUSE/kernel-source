Subject: [PATCH] usb: hub: Fix link power management max exit latency (MEL) calculations
Git-commit: 1bf2761c837571a66ec290fb66c90413821ffda2
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc3
References: git-fixes

Maximum Exit Latency (MEL) value is used by host to know how much in
advance it needs to start waking up a U1/U2 suspended link in order to
service a periodic transfer in time.

Current MEL calculation only includes the time to wake up the path from
U1/U2 to U0. This is called tMEL1 in USB 3.1 section C 1.5.2

Total MEL = tMEL1 + tMEL2 +tMEL3 + tMEL4 which should additinally include:
- tMEL2 which is the time it takes for PING message to reach device
- tMEL3 time for device to process the PING and submit a PING_RESPONSE
- tMEL4 time for PING_RESPONSE to traverse back upstream to host.

Add the missing tMEL2, tMEL3 and tMEL4 to MEL calculation.

Subject: [PATCH] sched/deadline: Fix replenish_dl_new_period dl_server
 condition

References: bsc#1234634 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc3
Git-commit: 22368fe1f9bbf39db2b5b52859589883273e80ce

The condition in replenish_dl_new_period() that checks if a reservation
(dl_server) is deferred and is not handling a starvation case is
obviously wrong.

Fix it.

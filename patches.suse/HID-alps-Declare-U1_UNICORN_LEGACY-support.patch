Subject: [PATCH] HID: alps: Declare U1_UNICORN_LEGACY support
Git-commit: 1117d182c5d72abd7eb8b7d5e7b8c3373181c3ab
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

U1_UNICORN_LEGACY id was added to the driver, but was not declared
in the device id table, making it impossible to use.

Fixes: 640e403 ("HID: alps: Add AUI1657 device ID")

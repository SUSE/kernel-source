Subject: tcp: fix TFO SYN_RECV to not zero retrans_stamp with retransmits out
Git-commit: 27c80efcc20486c82698f05f00e288b44513c86b
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc3

Fix tcp_rcv_synrecv_state_fastopen() to not zero retrans_stamp
if retransmits are outstanding.

tcp_fastopen_synack_timer() sets retrans_stamp, so typically we'll
need to zero retrans_stamp here to prevent spurious
retransmits_timed_out(). The logic to zero retrans_stamp is from this
2019 commit:

commit cd736d8b67fb ("tcp: fix retrans timestamp on passive Fast Open")

However, in the corner case where the ACK of our TFO SYNACK carried
some SACK blocks that caused us to enter TCP_CA_Recovery then that
non-zero retrans_stamp corresponds to the active fast recovery, and we
need to leave retrans_stamp with its current non-zero value, for
correct ETIMEDOUT and undo behavior.

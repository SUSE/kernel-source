Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: amd: ps: Adjust the gain for PDM DMIC
Git-commit: 99ecc7889bee68fdf377f328c21ad0f953f8b05e
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: bsc#1219136

No issues have been reported yet for DMIC audio level on ps platforms,
but as problems were found both on YC (Rembrandt) and Renoir based
designs it's very likely they happen on ps too.

Increase the PDM gain to solve this problem.

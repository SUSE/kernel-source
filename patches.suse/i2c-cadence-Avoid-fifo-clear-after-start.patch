Subject: [PATCH] i2c: cadence: Avoid fifo clear after start
Git-commit: c2e55b449de7298a751ed0256251019d302af453
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: git-fixes

The Driver unintentionally programs ctrl reg to clear the fifo, which
happens after the start of transaction. Previously, this was not an issue
as it involved read-modified-write. However, this issue breaks i2c reads
on QEMU, as i2c-read is executed before guest starts programming control
register.

Fixes: ff0cf7bca630 ("i2c: cadence: Remove unnecessary register reads")

Subject: [PATCH] USB: Follow-up to SPDX GPL-2.0+ identifiers addition - remove now useless comments
Git-commit: 3e00a22fdc9a9457f1c64d885532710e174babd8
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

All these files have been updated in the commit given in the Fixes: tag
below.

When the SPDX-License-Identifier: has been added, the corresponding text at
the beginning of the files has not been deleted.
All these texts are about GPL-2.0+, with different variation in the
wording.

Remove these now useless lines to save some LoC.

Fixes: 5fd54ace4721 ("USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/")

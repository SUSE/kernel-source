Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx7ulp: Fix 'assigned-clocks-parents' typo
Git-commit: 6d58c5e21a3fe355ce6d1808e96d02a610265218
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc4
References: git-fixes

The correct property name is 'assigned-clock-parents', not
'assigned-clocks-parents'. Though if the platform works with the typo, one
has to wonder if the property is even needed.

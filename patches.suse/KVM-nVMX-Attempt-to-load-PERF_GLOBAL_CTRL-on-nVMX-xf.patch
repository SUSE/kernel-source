Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Attempt to load PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL on nVMX xfer iff
 it exists

Attempt to load PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL during nested VM-Enter/VM-Exit if and
only if the MSR exists (according to the guest vCPU model).  KVM has very
misguided handling of VM_{ENTRY,EXIT}_LOAD_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL and
attempts to force the nVMX MSR settings to match the vPMU model, i.e. to
hide/expose the control based on whether or not the MSR exists from the
guest's perspective.

KVM's modifications fail to handle the scenario where the vPMU is hidden
from the guest _after_ being exposed to the guest, e.g. by userspace
doing multiple KVM_SET_CPUID2 calls, which is allowed if done before any
KVM_RUN.  nested_vmx_pmu_refresh() is called if and only if there's a
recognized vPMU, i.e. KVM will leave the bits in the allow state and then
ultimately reject the MSR load and WARN.

KVM should not force the VMX MSRs in the first place.  KVM taking control
of the MSRs was a misguided attempt at mimicking what commit 5f76f6f5ff96
("KVM: nVMX: Do not expose MPX VMX controls when guest MPX disabled",
2018-10-01) did for MPX.  However, the MPX commit was a workaround for
another KVM bug and not something that should be imitated (and it should
never been done in the first place).

In other words, KVM's ABI _should_ be that userspace has full control
over the MSRs, at which point triggering the WARN that loading the MSR
must not fail is trivial.

The intent of the WARN is still valid; KVM has consistency checks to
ensure that vmcs12->{guest,host}_ia32_perf_global_ctrl is valid.  The
problem is that '0' must be considered a valid value at all times, and so
the simple/obvious solution is to just not actually load the MSR when it
does not exist.  It is userspace's responsibility to provide a sane vCPU
model, i.e. KVM is well within its ABI and Intel's VMX architecture to
skip the loads if the MSR does not exist.

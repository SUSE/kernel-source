Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB

References: bsc#1215199
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc5
Git-commit: f1acb109505d983779bbb7e20a1ee6244d2b5736

KASAN is seen to increase stack usage, to the point that it was reported
to lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).

To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in
commit 3e8635fb2e07 ("powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with
KASAN").

However with a 32KB stack size to begin with, the doubling leads to a
64KB stack, which causes build errors:
  arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)

Although the asm could be reworked, in practice a 32KB stack seems
sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in
the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.

So only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB.

Fixes: 18f14afe2816 ("powerpc/64s: Increase default stack size to 32KB")

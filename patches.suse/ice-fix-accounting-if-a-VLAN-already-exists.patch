Subject: ice: fix accounting if a VLAN already exists
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc2
Git-commit: 82617b9a04649e83ee8731918aeadbb6e6d7cbc7
References: git-fixes

The ice_vsi_add_vlan() function is used to add a VLAN filter for the target
VSI. This function prepares a filter in the switch table for the given VSI.
If it succeeds, the vsi->num_vlan counter is incremented.

It is not considered an error to add a VLAN which already exists in the
switch table, so the function explicitly checks and ignores -EEXIST. The
vsi->num_vlan counter is still incremented.

This seems incorrect, as it means we can double-count in the case where the
same VLAN is added twice by the caller. The actual table will have one less
filter than the count.

The ice_vsi_del_vlan() function similarly checks and handles the -ENOENT
condition for when deleting a filter that doesn't exist. This flow only
decrements the vsi->num_vlan if it actually deleted a filter.

The vsi->num_vlan counter is used only in a few places, primarily related
to tracking the number of non-zero VLANs. If the vsi->num_vlans gets out of
sync, then ice_vsi_num_non_zero_vlans() will incorrectly report more VLANs
than are present, and ice_vsi_has_non_zero_vlans() could return true
potentially in cases where there are only VLAN 0 filters left.

Fix this by only incrementing the vsi->num_vlan in the case where we
actually added an entry, and not in the case where the entry already
existed.

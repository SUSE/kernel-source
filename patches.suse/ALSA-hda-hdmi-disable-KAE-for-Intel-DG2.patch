Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/hdmi: disable KAE for Intel DG2
Git-commit: 6ab6f98fcdc9d4fbe245aa67de03542deea65322
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc7
References: git-fixes

Use of keep-alive (KAE) has resulted in loss of audio on some A750/770
cards as the transition from keep-alive to stream playback is not
working as expected. As there is limited benefit of the new KAE mode
on discrete cards, revert back to older silent-stream implementation
on these systems.

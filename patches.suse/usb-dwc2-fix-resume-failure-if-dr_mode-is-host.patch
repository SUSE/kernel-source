Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc2: fix resume failure if dr_mode is host
Git-commit: a52e4f2dff413b58c7200e89bb6540bd995e1269
Patch-mainline: v7.0-rc1
References: git-fixes

commit 13b1f8e25bfd1 ("usb: dwc2: Force mode optimizations") removed the
dwc2_force_mode(hsotg, true) in dwc2_force_dr_mode() if dr_mode is host.

But this brings a bug: the controller fails to resume back as host,
further debugging shows that the controller is resumed as peripheral.
The reason is dwc2_force_dr_mode() missed the host mode forcing, and
when resuming from s2ram, GINTSTS is 0 by default, dwc2_is_device_mode
in dwc2_resume() misreads this as the controller is in peripheral mode.

Fix the resume failure by adding back the dwc2_force_mode(hsotg, true).

Then an obvious question is: why this bug hasn't been observed and fixed
for about six years? There are two resons: most dwc2 platforms set the
dr_mode as otg; Some platforms don't have suspend & resume support yet.

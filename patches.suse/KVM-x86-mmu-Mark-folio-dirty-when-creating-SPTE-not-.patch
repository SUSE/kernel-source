Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/mmu: Mark folio dirty when creating SPTE, not when
 zapping/modifying
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Mark pages/folios dirty when creating SPTEs to map PFNs into the guest,
not when zapping or modifying SPTEs, as marking folios dirty when zapping
or modifying SPTEs can be extremely inefficient.  E.g. when KVM is zapping
collapsible SPTEs to reconstitute a hugepage after disbling dirty logging,
KVM will mark every 4KiB pfn as dirty, even though _at least_ 512 pfns are
guaranteed to be in a single folio (the SPTE couldn't potentially be huge
if that weren't the case).  The problem only becomes worse for 1GiB
HugeTLB pages, as KVM can mark a single folio dirty 512*512 times.

Marking a folio dirty when mapping is functionally safe as KVM drops all
relevant SPTEs in response to an mmu_notifier invalidation, i.e. ensures
that the guest can't dirty a folio after access has been removed.

And because KVM already marks folios dirty when zapping/modifying SPTEs
for KVM reasons, i.e. not in response to an mmu_notifier invalidation,
there is no danger of "prematurely" marking a folio dirty.  E.g. if a
filesystems cleans a folio without first removing write access, then there
already exists races where KVM could mark a folio dirty before remote TLBs
are flushed, i.e. before guest writes are guaranteed to stop.  Furthermore,
x86 is literally the only architecture that marks folios dirty on the
backend; every other KVM architecture marks folios dirty at map time.

x86's unique behavior likely stems from the fact that x86's MMU predates
mmu_notifiers.  Long, long ago, before mmu_notifiers were added, marking
pages dirty when zapping SPTEs was logical, and perhaps even necessary, as
KVM held references to pages, i.e. kept a page's refcount elevated while
the page was mapped into the guest.  At the time, KVM's rmap_remove()
simply did:

        if (is_writeble_pte(*spte))
                kvm_release_pfn_dirty(pfn);
        else
                kvm_release_pfn_clean(pfn);

i.e. dropped the refcount and marked the page dirty at the same time.
After mmu_notifiers were introduced, commit acb66dd051d0 ("KVM: MMU:
don't hold pagecount reference for mapped sptes pages") removed the
refcount logic, but kept the dirty logic, i.e. converted the above to:

	if (is_writeble_pte(*spte))
		kvm_release_pfn_dirty(pfn);

And for KVM x86, that's essentially how things have stayed over the last
~15 years, without anyone revisiting *why* KVM marks pages/folios dirty at
zap/modification time, e.g. the behavior was blindly carried forward to
the TDP MMU.

Practically speaking, the only downside to marking a folio dirty during
mapping is that KVM could trigger writeback of memory that was never
actually written.  Except that can't actually happen if KVM marks folios
dirty if and only if a writable SPTE is created (as done here), because
KVM always marks writable SPTEs as dirty during make_spte().  See commit
9b51a63024bd ("KVM: MMU: Explicitly set D-bit for writable spte."), circa
2015.

Note, KVM's access tracking logic for prefetched SPTEs is a bit odd.  If a
guest PTE is dirty and writable, KVM will create a writable SPTE, but then
mark the SPTE for access tracking.  Which isn't wrong, just a bit odd, as
it results in _more_ precise dirty tracking for MMUs _without_ A/D bits.

To keep things simple, mark the folio dirty before access tracking comes
into play, as an access-tracked SPTE can be restored in the fast page
fault path, i.e. without holding mmu_lock.  While writing SPTEs and
accessing memslots outside of mmu_lock is safe, marking a folio dirty is
not.  E.g. if the fast path gets interrupted _just_ after setting a SPTE,
the primary MMU could theoretically invalidate and free a folio before KVM
marks it dirty.  Unlike the shadow MMU, which waits for CPUs to respond to
an IPI, the TDP MMU only guarantees the page tables themselves won't be
freed (via RCU).

Opportunistically update a few stale comments.

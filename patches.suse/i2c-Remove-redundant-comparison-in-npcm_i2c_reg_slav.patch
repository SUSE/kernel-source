Subject: [PATCH] i2c: Remove redundant comparison in npcm_i2c_reg_slave
Git-commit: 48acf8292280f257fb0047478153a81471ee7f4d
References: jsc#PED-10702
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1

In the npcm_i2c_reg_slave() function, there was a redundant
comparison that checked if 'bus->slave' was null immediately after
assigning it the 'client' value. There were concerns about a
potential null dereference because of `client->adapter`, but
according to Wolfram Sang, "we trusted ourselves here" Therefore,
this comparison is unnecessary.

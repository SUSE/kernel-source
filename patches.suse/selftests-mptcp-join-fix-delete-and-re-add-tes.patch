Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: fix 'delete and re-add' test
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.11
Git-commit: aaf2123a5cf46dbd97f84b6eee80269758064d93

commit aaf2123a5cf46dbd97f84b6eee80269758064d93 upstream.

mptcp_join 'delete and re-add' test fails when using ip mptcp:

  $ ./mptcp_join.sh -iI
  <snip>
  002 delete and re-add                    before delete[ ok ]
                                           mptcp_info subflows=1         [ ok ]
  Error: argument "ADDRESS" is wrong: invalid for non-zero id address
                                           after delete[fail] got 2:2 subflows expected 1

This happens because endpoint delete includes an ip address while id is
not 0, contrary to what is indicated in the ip mptcp man page:

"When used with the delete id operation, an IFADDR is only included when
the ID is 0."

This fixes the issue using the $addr variable in pm_nl_del_endpoint()
only when id is 0.

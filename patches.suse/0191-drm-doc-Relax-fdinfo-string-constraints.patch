Subject: drm/doc: Relax fdinfo string constraints
Git-commit: 90d63a150b85fd1debb9c01237fb78faee02746a
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
References: jsc#PED-3527 jsc#PED-5475 jsc#PED-6068 jsc#PED-6070 jsc#PED-6116 jsc#PED-6120 jsc#PED-5065 jsc#PED-5477 jsc#PED-5511 jsc#PED-6041 jsc#PED-6069 jsc#PED-6071

The restriction about no whitespace, etc, really only applies to the
usage of strings in keys.  Values can contain anything (other than
newline).

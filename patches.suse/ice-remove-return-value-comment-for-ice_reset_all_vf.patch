Subject: ice: remove return value comment for ice_reset_all_vfs
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
Git-commit: 00be8197c9741b91700289a33c25b7b6de951cc9
References: jsc#PED-376

Since commit fe99d1c06c16 ("ice: make ice_reset_all_vfs void"), the
ice_reset_all_vfs function has not returned anything. The function comment
still indicated it did. Fix this.

While here, also add a line to clarify the function resets all VFs at once
in response to hardware resets such as a PF reset.

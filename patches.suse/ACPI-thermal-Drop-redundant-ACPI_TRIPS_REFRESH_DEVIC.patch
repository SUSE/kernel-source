Subject: ACPI: thermal: Drop redundant ACPI_TRIPS_REFRESH_DEVICES symbol
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1
Git-commit: a809560469957249f35afe7f5e31fcd58dc21d96
References: jsc#PED-6741

Drop the ACPI_TRIPS_REFRESH_DEVICES symbol which is redundant, because
ACPI_TRIPS_DEVICES can be used directly instead of it without any
drawbacks and rename the ACPI_TRIPS_REFRESH_THRESHOLDS to
ACPI_TRIPS_THRESHOLDS to make the code a bit more consistent.

While at it, fix up some formatting white space used in the symbol
definitions.

No functional impact.

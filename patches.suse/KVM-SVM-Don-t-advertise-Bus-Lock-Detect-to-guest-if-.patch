Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Don't advertise Bus Lock Detect to guest if SVM
 support is missing

If host supports Bus Lock Detect, KVM advertises it to guests even if
SVM support is absent. Additionally, guest wouldn't be able to use it
despite guest CPUID bit being set. Fix it by unconditionally clearing
the feature bit in KVM cpu capability.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: broadcom: bcm4908: Fix cpu node for smp boot
Git-commit: 8bd582ae9a71d7f14c4e0c735b2eacaf7516d626
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc7
References: git-fixes

Add spin-table enable-method and cpu-release-addr properties for
cpu0 node. This is required by all ARMv8 SoC. Otherwise some
bootloader like u-boot can not update cpu-release-addr and linux
fails to start up secondary cpus.

Subject: drm/i915/guc: Close deregister-context race against CT-loss
Git-commit: 2f2cc53b5fe7022f3ae602eb24573d52f8740959
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: jsc#PED-9898 jsc#PED-10191 jsc#PED-10197 jsc#PED-10226 jsc#PED-10237 jsc#PED-10340 jsc#PED-10852 jsc#PED-11022

If we are at the end of suspend or very early in resume
its possible an async fence signal (via rcu_call) is triggered
to free_engines which could lead us to the execution of
the context destruction worker (after a prior worker flush).

Thus, when suspending, insert rcu_barriers at the start
of i915_gem_suspend (part of driver's suspend prepare) and
again in i915_gem_suspend_late so that all such cases have
completed and context destruction list isn't missing anything.

In destroyed_worker_func, close the race against CT-loss
by checking that CT is enabled before calling into
deregister_destroyed_contexts.

Based on testing, guc_lrc_desc_unpin may still race and fail
as we traverse the GuC's context-destroy list because the
CT could be disabled right before calling GuC's CT send function.

We've witnessed this race condition once every ~6000-8000
suspend-resume cycles while ensuring workloads that render
something onscreen is continuously started just before
we suspend (and the workload is small enough to complete
and trigger the queued engine/context free-up either very
late in suspend or very early in resume).

In such a case, we need to unroll the entire process because
guc-lrc-unpin takes a gt wakeref which only gets released in
the G2H IRQ reply that never comes through in this corner
case. Without the unroll, the taken wakeref is leaked and will
cascade into a kernel hang later at the tail end of suspend in
this function:

   intel_wakeref_wait_for_idle(&gt->wakeref)
   (called by) - intel_gt_pm_wait_for_idle
   (called by) - wait_for_suspend

Thus, do an unroll in guc_lrc_desc_unpin and deregister_destroyed_-
contexts if guc_lrc_desc_unpin fails due to CT send falure.
When unrolling, keep the context in the GuC's destroy-list so
it can get picked up on the next destroy worker invocation
(if suspend aborted) or get fully purged as part of a GuC
sanitization (end of suspend) or a reset flow.

Subject: [PATCH] smb3: fix unusable share after force unmount failure
Git-commit: 491eafce1a51c457701351a4bf40733799745314
References: bsc#1193629
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc4

If user does forced unmount ("umount -f") while files are still open
on the share (as was seen in a Kubernetes example running on SMB3.1.1
mount) then we were marking the share as "TID_EXITING" in umount_begin()
which caused all subsequent operations (except write) to fail ... but
unfortunately when umount_begin() is called we do not know yet that
there are open files or active references on the share that would prevent
unmount from succeeding.  Kubernetes had example when they were doing
umount -f when files were open which caused the share to become
unusable until the files were closed (and the umount retried).

Fix this so that TID_EXITING is not set until we are about to send
the tree disconnect (not at the beginning of forced umounts in
umount_begin) so that if "umount -f" fails (due to open files or
references) the mount is still usable.

Subject: [PATCH] firmware: Update Kconfig help text for Google firmware
Git-commit: d185a3466f0cd5af8f1c5c782c53bc0e6f2e7136
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

The help text for GOOGLE_FIRMWARE states that it should only be
enabled when building a kernel for Google's own servers.  However,
many of the drivers dependent on it are also useful on Chromebooks or
on any platform using coreboot.

Update the help text to reflect this double duty.

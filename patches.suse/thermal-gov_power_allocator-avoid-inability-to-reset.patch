Subject: thermal: gov_power_allocator: avoid inability to reset a cdev
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
Git-commit: e95fa7404716f6e25021e66067271a4ad8eb1486
References: jsc#PED-11164

Commit 0952177f2a1f ("thermal/core/power_allocator: Update once
cooling devices when temp is low") adds an update flag to avoid
triggering a thermal event when there is no need, and the thermal
cdev is updated once when the temperature is low.

But when the trips are writable, and switch_on_temp is set to be a
higher value, the cooling device state may not be reset to 0,
because last_temperature is smaller than switch_on_temp.

For example:
First:
switch_on_temp=70 control_temp=85;
Then userspace change the trip_temp:
switch_on_temp=45 control_temp=55 cur_temp=54

Then userspace reset the trip_temp:
switch_on_temp=70 control_temp=85 cur_temp=57 last_temp=54

At this time, the cooling device state should be reset to 0.
However, because cur_temp(57) < switch_on_temp(70)
last_temp(54) < switch_on_temp(70)  ---->  update = false,
update is false, the cooling device state can not be reset.

Using the observation that tz->passive can also be regarded as the
temperature status, set the update flag to the tz->passive value.

When the temperature drops below switch_on for the first time, the
states of cooling devices can be reset once, and tz->passive is updated
to 0. In the next round, because tz->passive is 0, cdev->state will not
be updated.

By using the tz->passive value as the "update" flag, the issue above
can be solved, and the cooling devices can be updated only once when the
temperature is low.

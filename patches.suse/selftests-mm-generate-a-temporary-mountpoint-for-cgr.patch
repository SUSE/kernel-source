Subject: [PATCH] selftests/mm: generate a temporary mountpoint for cgroup filesystem
Git-commit: 9c02223e2d9df5cb37c51aedb78f3960294e09b5
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc3
References: git-fixes

Currently if the filesystem for the cgroups version it wants to use is not
mounted charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh and hugetlb_reparenting_test.sh tests
will attempt to mount it on the hard coded path /dev/cgroup/memory,
deleting that directory when the test finishes.  This will fail if there
is not a preexisting directory at that path, and since the directory is
deleted subsequent runs of the test will fail.  Instead of relying on this
hard coded directory name use mktemp to generate a temporary directory to
use as a mountpoint, fixing both the assumption and the disruption caused
by deleting a preexisting directory.

This means that if the relevant cgroup filesystem is not already mounted
then we rely on having coreutils (which provides mktemp) installed.  I
suspect that many current users are relying on having things automounted
by default, and given that the script relies on bash it's probably not an
unreasonable requirement.

Subject: [PATCH] regulator: qcom_smd: Fix up PM8950 regulator configuration
Git-commit: b11b3d21a94d66bc05d1142e0b210bfa316c62be
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Following changes have been made:

- S5, L4, L18, L20 and L21 were removed (S5 is managed by
SPMI, whereas the rest seems not to exist [or at least it's blocked
by Sony Loire /MSM8956/ RPM firmware])

- Supply maps have were adjusted to reflect regulator changes.

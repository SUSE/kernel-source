Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Delete ancient pr_warn() about KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR not
 being set

Delete KVM's printk about KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR not being called.  When the
printk was added by commit 776e58ea3d37 ("KVM: unbreak userspace that does
not sets tss address"), KVM also stuffed a "hopefully safe" value, i.e.
the message wasn't purely informational.  For reasons unknown, ostensibly
to try and help people running outdated qemu-kvm versions, the message got
left behind when KVM's stuffing was removed by commit 4918c6ca6838
("KVM: VMX: Require KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR being called prior to running a VCPU").

Today, the message is completely nonsensical, as it has been over a decade
since KVM supported userspace running a Real Mode guest, on a CPU without
unrestricted guest support, without doing KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR before KVM_RUN.
I.e. KVM's ABI has required KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR for 10+ years.

To make matters worse, the message is prone to false positives as it
triggers when simply *creating* a vCPU due to RESET putting vCPUs into
Real Mode, even when the user has no intention of ever *running* the vCPU
in a Real Mode.  E.g. KVM selftests stuff 64-bit mode and never touch Real
Mode, but trigger the message even though they run just fine without
doing KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR.  Creating "dummy" vCPUs, e.g. to probe features,
can also trigger the message.  In both scenarios, the message confuses
users and falsely implies that they've done something wrong.

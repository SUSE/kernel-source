Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Inject #UD if VMXON is attempted with incompatible
 CR0/CR4

Inject a #UD if L1 attempts VMXON with a CR0 or CR4 that is disallowed
per the associated nested VMX MSRs' fixed0/1 settings.  KVM cannot rely
on hardware to perform the checks, even for the few checks that have
higher priority than VM-Exit, as (a) KVM may have forced CR0/CR4 bits in
hardware while running the guest, (b) there may incompatible CR0/CR4 bits
that have lower priority than VM-Exit, e.g. CR0.NE, and (c) userspace may
have further restricted the allowed CR0/CR4 values by manipulating the
guest's nested VMX MSRs.

Note, despite a very strong desire to throw shade at Jim, commit
70f3aac964ae ("kvm: nVMX: Remove superfluous VMX instruction fault checks")
is not to blame for the buggy behavior (though the comment...).  That
commit only removed the CR0.PE, EFLAGS.VM, and COMPATIBILITY mode checks
(though it did erroneously drop the CPL check, but that has already been
remedied).  KVM may force CR0.PE=1, but will do so only when also
forcing EFLAGS.VM=1 to emulate Real Mode, i.e. hardware will still #UD.

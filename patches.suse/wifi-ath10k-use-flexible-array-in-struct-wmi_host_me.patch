Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath10k: use flexible array in struct wmi_host_mem_chunks
Git-commit: d2eb318f4b6be1176e87ac3f9f8cc976be1c014b
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

Currently struct wmi_host_mem_chunks defines:
	struct host_memory_chunk items[1];

Per the guidance in [1] this should be a flexible array. However there
is a documented requirement:
	some fw revisions require at least 1 chunk regardless of count

To satisfy this requirement, follow the guidance from [2] and wrap the
array in a union which contains both the flexible array and a single
instance of the underlying struct. Since the footprint of the struct
is unchanged, no additional driver changes are required.

No functional changes, compile tested only.

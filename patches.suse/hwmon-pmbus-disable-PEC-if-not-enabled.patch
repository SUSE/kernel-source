Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (pmbus) disable PEC if not enabled
Git-commit: 75d2b2b06bd8407d03a3f126bc8b95eb356906c7
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc6
References: git-fixes

Explicitly disable PEC when the client does not support it.
The problematic scenario is the following. A device with enabled PEC
support is up and running and a kernel driver is loaded.
Then the driver is unloaded (or device unbound), the HW device
is reconfigured externally (e.g. by i2cset) to advertise itself as not
supporting PEC. Without a new code, at the second load of the driver
(or bind) the "flags" variable is not updated to avoid PEC usage. As a
consequence the further communication with the device is done with
the PEC enabled, which is wrong and may fail.

The implementation first disable the I2C_CLIENT_PEC flag, then the old
code enable it if needed.

Subject: tools/resolve_btfids: Do not print any commands when building
 silently
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc3
Git-commit: 7f3bdbc3f13146eb9d07de81ea71f551587a384b
References: jsc#PED-1368

When building with 'make -s', there is some output from resolve_btfids:

$ make -sj"$(nproc)" oldconfig prepare
  MKDIR     .../tools/bpf/resolve_btfids/libbpf/
  MKDIR     .../tools/bpf/resolve_btfids//libsubcmd
  LINK     resolve_btfids

Silent mode means that no information should be emitted about what is
currently being done. Use the $(silent) variable from Makefile.include
to avoid defining the msg macro so that there is no information printed.

Fixes: fbbb68de80a4 ("bpf: Add resolve_btfids tool to resolve BTF IDs in ELF object")

Subject: drm/bridge: tc358768: Stop disabling when failing to enable
Git-commit: 9c77154b71ad936227d0c407835854604c532700
Patch-mainline: v6.16-rc1
References: jsc#PED-13979 jsc#PED-14039 jsc#PED-14046 jsc#PED-14211 jsc#PED-14333 jsc#PED-14487 jsc#PED-14488 jsc#PED-14497 jsc#PED-14499 jsc#PED-15868

The tc358768 bridge driver, if enabling it fails, tries to disable it.
This is pretty uncommon in bridge drivers, and also stands in the way
for further reworks.

Worse, since pre_enable and enable aren't expected to fail, disable and
post_disable might be called twice: once to handle the failure, and once
to actually disable the bridge.

Since post_disable uses regulators and clocks, this would lead to enable
count imbalances.

In order to prevent that imbalance, and to allow further reworks, let's
drop the calls to disable and post_disable, but keep the warning to let
users know about what's going on.

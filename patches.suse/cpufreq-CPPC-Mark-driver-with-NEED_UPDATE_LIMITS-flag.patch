Subject: cpufreq: CPPC: Mark driver with NEED_UPDATE_LIMITS flag
References: stable-fixes

Git-commit: 0a1416a49e63c320f6e6c1c8d07e1b58c0d4a3f3


AMU counters on certain CPPC-based platforms tend to yield inaccurate
delivered performance measurements on systems that are idle/mostly idle.
This results in an inaccurate frequency being stored by cpufreq in its
policy structure when the CPU is brought online. [1]

Consequently, if the userspace governor tries to set the frequency to a
new value, there is a possibility that it would be the erroneous value
stored earlier. In such a scenario, cpufreq would assume that the
requested frequency has already been set and return early, resulting in
the correct/new frequency request never making it to the hardware.

Since the operating frequency is liable to this sort of inconsistency,
mark the CPPC driver with CPUFREQ_NEED_UPDATE_LIMITS so that it is always
invoked when a target frequency update is requested.

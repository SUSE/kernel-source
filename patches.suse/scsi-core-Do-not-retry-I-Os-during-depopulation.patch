Subject: scsi: core: Do not retry I/Os during depopulation
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc2
Git-commit: 9ff7c383b8ac0c482a1da7989f703406d78445c6
References: git-fixes

Fail I/Os instead of retry to prevent user space processes from being
blocked on the I/O completion for several minutes.

Retrying I/Os during "depopulation in progress" or "depopulation restore in
progress" results in a continuous retry loop until the depopulation
completes or until the I/O retry loop is aborted due to a timeout by the
scsi_cmd_runtime_exceeced().

Depopulation is slow and can take 24+ hours to complete on 20+ TB HDDs.
Most I/Os in the depopulation retry loop end up taking several minutes
before returning the failure to user space.

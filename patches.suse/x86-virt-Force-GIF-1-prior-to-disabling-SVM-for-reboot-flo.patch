Subject: x86/virt: Force GIF=1 prior to disabling SVM (for reboot flows)
Git-commit: 6a3236580b0b1accc3976345e723104f74f6f8e6
Patch-mainline: v6.3-rc1
References: git-fixes

Set GIF=1 prior to disabling SVM to ensure that INIT is recognized if the
kernel is disabling SVM in an emergency, e.g. if the kernel is about to
jump into a crash kernel or may reboot without doing a full CPU RESET.
If GIF is left cleared, the new kernel (or firmware) will be unabled to
awaken APs.  Eat faults on STGI (due to EFER.SVME=0) as it's possible
that SVM could be disabled via NMI shootdown between reading EFER.SVME
and executing STGI.

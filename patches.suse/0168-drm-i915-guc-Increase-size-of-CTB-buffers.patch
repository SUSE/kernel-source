Subject: drm/i915/guc: Increase size of CTB buffers
Git-commit: c26e289f1d8d5b8716f825ac5d798897aca5a124
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: jsc#SLE-22601

With the introduction of non-blocking CTBs more than one CTB can be in
flight at a time. Increasing the size of the CTBs should reduce how
often software hits the case where no space is available in the CTB
buffer.

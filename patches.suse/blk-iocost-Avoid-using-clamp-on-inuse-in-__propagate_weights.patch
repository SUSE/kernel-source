Subject: blk-iocost: Avoid using clamp() on inuse in __propagate_weights()
Git-commit: 57e420c84f9ab55ba4c5e2ae9c5f6c8e1ea834d2
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc3
References: git-fixes

After a recent change to clamp() and its variants [1] that increases the
coverage of the check that high is greater than low because it can be
done through inlining, certain build configurations (such as s390
defconfig) fail to build with clang with:

  block/blk-iocost.c:1101:11: error: call to '__compiletime_assert_557' declared with 'error' attribute: clamp() low limit 1 greater than high limit active
   1101 |                 inuse = clamp_t(u32, inuse, 1, active);

    195 |         __clamp_once(type, val, lo, hi, __UNIQUE_ID(v_), __UNIQUE_ID(l_), __UNIQUE_ID(h_))
        |         ^
  include/linux/minmax.h:188:2: note: expanded from macro '__clamp_once'
    188 |         BUILD_BUG_ON_MSG(statically_true(ulo > uhi),                            \
        |         ^

__propagate_weights() is called with an active value of zero in
ioc_check_iocgs(), which results in the high value being less than the
low value, which is undefined because the value returned depends on the
order of the comparisons.

The purpose of this expression is to ensure inuse is not more than
active and at least 1. This could be written more simply with a ternary
expression that uses min(inuse, active) as the condition so that the
value of that condition can be used if it is not zero and one if it is.
Do this conversion to resolve the error and add a comment to deter
people from turning this back into clamp().

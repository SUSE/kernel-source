Subject: [PATCH] Revert "net: phy: dp83867: perform soft reset and retain established link"
Git-commit: a129b41fe0a8b4da828c46b10f5244ca07a3fec3
Patch-mainline: v6.4
References: git-fixes

This reverts commit da9ef50f545f86ffe6ff786174d26500c4db737a.

This fixes a regression in which the link would come up, but no
communication was possible.

The reverted commit was also removing a comment about
DP83867_PHYCR_FORCE_LINK_GOOD, this is not added back in this commits
since it seems that this is unrelated to the original code change.

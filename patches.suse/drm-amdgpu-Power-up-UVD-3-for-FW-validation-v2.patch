Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdgpu: Power up UVD 3 for FW validation (v2)

Patch-mainline: v6.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

Unlike later versions, UVD 3 has firmware validation.
For this to work, the UVD should be powered up correctly.

When DPM is enabled and the display clock is off,
the SMU may choose a power state which doesn't power
the UVD, which can result in failure to initialize UVD.

V2: 
Add code comments to explain about the UVD power state
and how UVD clock is turned on/off.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Assume timer IRQ was injected if APIC state is
 protected

If APIC state is protected, i.e. the vCPU is a TDX guest, assume a timer
IRQ was injected when deciding whether or not to busy wait in the "timer
advanced" path.  The "real" vIRR is not readable/writable, so trying to
query for a pending timer IRQ will return garbage.

Note, TDX can scour the PIR if it wants to be more precise and skip the
"wait" call entirely.

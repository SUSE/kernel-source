Subject: [PATCH] Input: xpad - delete a Razer DeathAdder mouse VID/PID entry
Git-commit: feee70f4568650cf44c573488798ffc0a2faeea3
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc6
References: git-fixes

While doing my research to improve the xpad device names I noticed
that the 1532:0037 VID/PID seems to be used by the DeathAdder 2013,
so that Razer Sabertooth instance looked wrong and very suspect to
me. I didn't see any mention in the official drivers, either.

After doing more research, it turns out that the xpad list
is used by many other projects (like Steam) as-is [1], this
issue was reported [2] and Valve/Sam Lantinga fixed it [3]:

[3]: https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/29809f6f0271

(With multiple Internet users reporting similar issues, not linked here)

After not being able to find the correct VID/PID combination anywhere
on the Internet and not receiving any reply from Razer support I did
some additional detective work, it seems like it presents itself as
"Razer Sabertooth Gaming Controller (XBOX360)", code 1689:FE00.

Leaving us with this:
 * Razer Sabertooth (1689:fe00)
 * Razer Sabertooth Elite (24c6:5d04)
 * Razer DeathAdder 2013 (1532:0037) [note: not a gamepad]

So, to sum things up; remove this conflicting/duplicate entry:

{ 0x1532, 0x0037, "Razer Sabertooth", 0, XTYPE_XBOX360 },

As the real/correct one is already present there, even if
the Internet as a whole insists on presenting it as the
Razer Sabertooth Elite, which (by all accounts) is not:

{ 0x1689, 0xfe00, "Razer Sabertooth", 0, XTYPE_XBOX360 },

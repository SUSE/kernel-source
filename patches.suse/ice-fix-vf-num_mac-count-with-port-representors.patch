Subject: ice: fix vf->num_mac count with port representors
Patch-mainline: v6.15
Git-commit: bbd95160a03dbfcd01a541f25c27ddb730dfbbd5
References: git-fixes

The ice_vc_repr_add_mac() function indicates that it does not store the MAC
address filters in the firmware. However, it still increments vf->num_mac.
This is incorrect, as vf->num_mac should represent the number of MAC
filters currently programmed to firmware.

Indeed, we only perform this increment if the requested filter is a unicast
address that doesn't match the existing vf->hw_lan_addr. In addition,
ice_vc_repr_del_mac() does not decrement the vf->num_mac counter. This
results in the counter becoming out of sync with the actual count.

As it turns out, vf->num_mac is currently only used in legacy made without
port representors. The single place where the value is checked is for
enforcing a filter limit on untrusted VFs.

Upcoming patches to support VF Live Migration will use this value when
determining the size of the TLV for MAC address filters. Fix the
representor mode function to stop incrementing the counter incorrectly.

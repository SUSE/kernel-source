Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda: Disable runtime resume at shutdown
Git-commit: 2eaf1635f9d62a2774c1c8114db24456dfd00721
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1192354

Although we modified the codec shutdown callback to perform
runtime-suspend, it's still not fully effective, as this may be
resumed again at any time later.

For fixing such an unwanted resume, this patch replaces
pm_runtime_suspend() with pm_runtime_force_suspend(), and call
pm_runtime_disable() afterward.  It assures to keep the device
suspended.

Also for code simplification, we apply the code unconditionally; when
it's been already suspended, nothing would happen by calls of
snd_pcm_suspend_all() and pm_runtime_force_suspend(), just proceed to
pm_runtime_disable().

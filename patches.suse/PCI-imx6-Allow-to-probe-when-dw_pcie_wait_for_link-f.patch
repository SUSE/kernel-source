Subject: [PATCH] PCI: imx6: Allow to probe when dw_pcie_wait_for_link() fails
Git-commit: f81f095e87715e198471f4653952fe5e3f824874
Patch-mainline: v5.18-rc1
References: git-fixes

The intention of commit 886a9c134755 ("PCI: dwc: Move link handling into
common code") was to standardize the behavior of link down as explained
in its commit log:

"The behavior for a link down was inconsistent as some drivers would fail
probe in that case while others succeed. Let's standardize this to
succeed as there are usecases where devices (and the link) appear later
even without hotplug. For example, a reconfigured FPGA device."

The pci-imx6 still fails to probe when the link is not present, which
causes the following warning:

imx6q-pcie 8ffc000.pcie: Phy link never came up

Imx6q-pcie: probe of 8ffc000.pcie failed with error -110

Fix this problem by ignoring the dw_pcie_wait_for_link() error like
it is done on the other dwc drivers.

Tested on imx6sx-sdb and imx6q-sabresd boards.

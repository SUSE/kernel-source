Subject: [PATCH] sched: Clear ttwu_pending after enqueue_task()

References: git fixes (sched/core)
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
Git-commit: d6962c4fe8f96f7d384d6489b6b5ab5bf3e35991

We found a long tail latency in schbench whem m*t is close to nr_cpus.
(e.g., "schbench -m 2 -t 16" on a machine with 32 cpus.)

This is because when the wakee cpu is idle, rq->ttwu_pending is cleared
too early, and idle_cpu() will return true until the wakee task enqueued.
This will mislead the waker when selecting idle cpu, and wake multiple
worker threads on the same wakee cpu. This situation is enlarged by
commit f3dd3f674555 ("sched: Remove the limitation of WF_ON_CPU on
wakelist if wakee cpu is idle") because it tends to use wakelist.

Here is the result of "schbench -m 2 -t 16" on a VM with 32vcpu
(Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8369B).

We also tested on unixbench and hackbench, and saw no performance
change.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-dsp: Skip IMR boot on ACE platforms in case of S3 suspend
Git-commit: c61115b37ff964d63191dbf4a058f481daabdf57
Patch-mainline: v6.9-rc3
References: stable-fixes

SoCs with ACE architecture are tailored to use s2idle instead deep (S3)
suspend state and the IMR content is lost when the system is forced to
enter even to S3.
When waking up from S3 state the IMR boot will fail as the content is lost.
Set the skip_imr_boot flag to make sure that we don't try IMR in this case.

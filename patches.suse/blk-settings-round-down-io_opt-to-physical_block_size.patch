Subject: blk-settings: round down io_opt to physical_block_size
Git-commit: 9c0ba14828d64744ccd195c610594ba254a1a9ab
Patch-mainline: v6.13-rc1
References: git-fixes

There was a bug report [1] where the user got a warning alignment
inconsistency. The user has optimal I/O 16776704 (0xFFFE00) and physical
block size 4096. Note that the optimal I/O size may be set by the DMA
engines or SCSI controllers and they have no knowledge about the disks
attached to them, so the situation with optimal I/O not aligned to
physical block size may happen.

This commit makes blk_validate_limits round down optimal I/O size to the
physical block size of the block device.

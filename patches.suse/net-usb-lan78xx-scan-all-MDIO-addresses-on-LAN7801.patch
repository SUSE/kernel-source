Subject: [PATCH] net: usb: lan78xx: scan all MDIO addresses on LAN7801
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: f1e2f0ce704e4a14e3f367d3b97d3dd2d8e183b7
Patch-mainline: v7.0-rc2
References: git-fixes

The LAN7801 is designed exclusively for external PHYs (unlike the
LAN7800/LAN7850 which have internal PHYs), but lan78xx_mdio_init()
restricts PHY scanning to MDIO addresses 0-7 by setting phy_mask to
~(0xFF). This prevents discovery of external PHYs wired to addresses
outside that range.

One such case is the DP83TC814 100BASE-T1 PHY, which is typically
configured at MDIO address 10 via PHYAD bootstrap pins and goes
undetected with the current mask.

Remove the restrictive phy_mask assignment for the LAN7801 so that the
default mask of 0 applies, allowing all 32 MDIO addresses to be
scanned during bus registration.

This issue can be reproduced by the following pressuse test:
1. A large number of cpuset cgroups are deleted.
2. Set cpu on and off repeatly.
3. Set watchdog_thresh repeatly.
The scripts can be obtained at LINK mentioned above the signature.

The reason for this issue is cgroup_mutex and cpu_hotplug_lock are
acquired in different tasks, which may lead to deadlock.
It can lead to a deadlock through the following steps:
1. A large number of cpusets are deleted asynchronously, which puts a
   large number of cgroup_bpf_release works into system_wq. The max_active
   of system_wq is WQ_DFL_ACTIVE(256). Consequently, all active works are
   cgroup_bpf_release works, and many cgroup_bpf_release works will be put
   into inactive queue. As illustrated in the diagram, there are 256 (in
   the acvtive queue) + n (in the inactive queue) works.
2. Setting watchdog_thresh will hold cpu_hotplug_lock.read and put
   smp_call_on_cpu work into system_wq. However step 1 has already filled
   system_wq, 'sscs.work' is put into inactive queue. 'sscs.work' has
   to wait until the works that were put into the inacvtive queue earlier
   have executed (n cgroup_bpf_release), so it will be blocked for a while.
3. Cpu offline requires cpu_hotplug_lock.write, which is blocked by step 2.
4. Cpusets that were deleted at step 1 put cgroup_release works into
   cgroup_destroy_wq. They are competing to get cgroup_mutex all the time.
   When cgroup_metux is acqured by work at css_killed_work_fn, it will
   call cpuset_css_offline, which needs to acqure cpu_hotplug_lock.read.
   However, cpuset_css_offline will be blocked for step 3.
5. At this moment, there are 256 works in active queue that are
   cgroup_bpf_release, they are attempting to acquire cgroup_mutex, and as
   a result, all of them are blocked. Consequently, sscs.work can not be
   executed. Ultimately, this situation leads to four processes being
   blocked, forming a deadlock.

				put sscs.work into system_wq

				warting sscs.work finish

								P(cpu_hotplug_lock.write)
								...blocking...
											css_killed_work_fn
											P(cgroup_mutex)
											cpuset_css_offline
											P(cpu_hotplug_lock.read)
											...blocking...
256 cgroup_bpf_release
mutex_lock(&cgroup_mutex);
..blocking...

To fix the problem, place cgroup_bpf_release works on a dedicated
workqueue which can break the loop and solve the problem. System wqs are
for misc things which shouldn't create a large number of concurrent work
items. If something is going to generate >WQ_DFL_ACTIVE(256) concurrent
work items, it should use its own dedicated workqueue.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: cfg80211: address several kerneldoc warnings
Git-commit: 3361597890ba901e4b666c2467b2cba349b0f63b
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: bsc#1227149

include/net/cfg80211.h includes a number of kerneldoc entries for struct
members that do not exist, leading to these warnings:

  ./include/net/cfg80211.h:3192: warning: Excess struct member 'band_pref' description in 'cfg80211_bss_selection'
  ./include/net/cfg80211.h:3192: warning: Excess struct member 'adjust' description in 'cfg80211_bss_selection'
  ./include/net/cfg80211.h:6181: warning: Excess struct member 'bssid' description in 'wireless_dev'
  ./include/net/cfg80211.h:6181: warning: Excess struct member 'beacon_interval' description in 'wireless_dev'
  ./include/net/cfg80211.h:7299: warning: Excess struct member 'bss' description in 'cfg80211_rx_assoc_resp_data'

Remove and/or repair each entry to address the warnings and ensure a proper
docs build for the affected structures.

Subject: [PATCH] sched/deadline: Fix BUG_ON condition for deboosted tasks
Git-commit: ddfc710395cccc61247348df9eb18ea50321cbed
Patch-mainline: v5.19-rc8
References: git-fixes

Tasks the are being deboosted from SCHED_DEADLINE might enter
enqueue_task_dl() one last time and hit an erroneous BUG_ON condition:
since they are not boosted anymore, the if (is_dl_boosted()) branch is
not taken, but the else if (!dl_prio) is and inside this one we
BUG_ON(!is_dl_boosted), which is of course false (BUG_ON triggered)
otherwise we had entered the if branch above. Long story short, the
current condition doesn't make sense and always leads to triggering of a
BUG.

Fix this by only checking enqueue flags, properly: ENQUEUE_REPLENISH has
to be present, but additional flags are not a problem.

Fixes: 64be6f1f5f71 ("sched/deadline: Don't replenish from a !SCHED_DEADLINE entity")

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: qcom: Do not advertise hotplug capability for IP v2.1.0
Git-commit: 1fdecc5bc8e81b0afba17876ff99b4131d0e03aa
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.5-rc1

SoCs making use of Qcom PCIe controller IP v2.1.0 do not support hotplug
functionality. But the hotplug capability bit is set by default in the
hardware. This causes the kernel PCI core to register hotplug service for
the controller and send hotplug commands to it. But those commands will
timeout generating messages as below during boot and suspend/resume.

[    5.782159] pcieport 0001:00:00.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x03c0 (issued 2020 msec ago)
[    5.810161] pcieport 0001:00:00.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x03c0 (issued 2048 msec ago)
[    7.838162] pcieport 0001:00:00.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x07c0 (issued 2020 msec ago)
[    7.870159] pcieport 0001:00:00.0: pciehp: Timeout on hotplug command 0x07c0 (issued 2052 msec ago)

This not only spams the console output but also induces a delay of a
couple of seconds. To fix this issue, let's clear the HPC bit in
PCI_EXP_SLTCAP register as a part of the post init sequence to not
advertise the hotplug capability for the controller.

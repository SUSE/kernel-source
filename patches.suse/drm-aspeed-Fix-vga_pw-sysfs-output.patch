Subject: [PATCH] drm/aspeed: Fix vga_pw sysfs output
Git-commit: b4a6aaeaf4aa79f23775f6688a7e8db3ee1c1303
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc3
References: git-fixes

Before the drm driver had support for this file there was a driver that
exposed the contents of the vga password register to userspace. It would
present the entire register instead of interpreting it.

The drm implementation chose to mask of the lower bit, without explaining
why. This breaks the existing userspace, which is looking for 0xa8 in
the lower byte.

Change our implementation to expose the entire register.

Subject: scsi: storvsc: Set correct data length for sending SCSI command without payload
Git-commit: 87c4b5e8a6b65189abd9ea5010ab308941f964a4
References: git-fixes

In StorVSC, payload->range.len is used to indicate if this SCSI command
carries payload. This data is allocated as part of the private driver data
by the upper layer and may get passed to lower driver uninitialized.

For example, the SCSI error handling mid layer may send TEST_UNIT_READY or
REQUEST_SENSE while reusing the buffer from a failed command. The private
data section may have stale data from the previous command.

If the SCSI command doesn't carry payload, the driver may use this value as
is for communicating with host, resulting in possible corruption.

Fix this by always initializing this value.

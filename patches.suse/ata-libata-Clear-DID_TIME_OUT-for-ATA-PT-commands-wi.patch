Subject: [PATCH] ata: libata: Clear DID_TIME_OUT for ATA PT commands with sense data
Git-commit: e5dd410acb34c7341a0a93b429dcf3dabf9e3323
Patch-mainline: v6.12-rc1
References: git-fixes

When ata_qc_complete() schedules a command for EH using
ata_qc_schedule_eh(), blk_abort_request() will be called, which leads to
req->q->mq_ops->timeout() / scsi_timeout() being called.

scsi_timeout(), if the LLDD has no abort handler (libata has no abort
handler), will set host byte to DID_TIME_OUT, and then call
scsi_eh_scmd_add() to add the command to EH.

Thus, when commands first enter libata's EH strategy_handler, all the
commands that have been added to EH will have DID_TIME_OUT set.

libata has its own flag (AC_ERR_TIMEOUT), that it sets for commands that
have not received a completion at the time of entering EH.

Thus, libata doesn't really care about DID_TIME_OUT at all, and currently
clears the host byte at the end of EH, in ata_scsi_qc_complete(), before
scsi_eh_finish_cmd() is called.

However, this clearing in ata_scsi_qc_complete() is currently only done
for commands that are not ATA passthrough commands.

Since the host byte is visible in the completion that we return to user
space for ATA passthrough commands, for ATA passthrough commands that got
completed via EH (commands with sense data), the user will incorrectly see:
ATA pass-through(16): transport error: Host_status=0x03 [DID_TIME_OUT]

Fix this by moving the clearing of the host byte (which is currently only
done for commands that are not ATA passthrough commands) from
ata_scsi_qc_complete() to the start of EH (regardless if the command is
ATA passthrough or not).

While at it, use the proper helper function to clear the host byte, rather
than open coding the clearing.

This will make sure that we:
-Correctly clear DID_TIME_OUT for both ATA passthrough commands and
 commands that are not ATA passthrough commands.
-Do not needlessly clear the host byte for commands that did not go via EH.
 ata_scsi_qc_complete() is called both for commands that are completed
 normally (without going via EH), and for commands that went via EH,
 however, only commands that went via EH will have DID_TIME_OUT set.

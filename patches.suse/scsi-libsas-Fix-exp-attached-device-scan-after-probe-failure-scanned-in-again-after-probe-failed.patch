Subject: scsi: libsas: Fix exp-attached device scan after probe failure
 scanned in again after probe failed
Git-commit: ab2068a6fb84751836a84c26ca72b3beb349619d
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc7
References: git-fixes

The expander phy will be treated as broadcast flutter in the next
revalidation after the exp-attached end device probe failed, as follows:

The cause of the problem is that the related ex_phy's attached_sas_addr was
not cleared after the end device probe failed, so reset it.

Subject: Documentation/x86: Document resctrl's new sparse_masks
MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: aaa5fa35743ab9f0726568611a85e3e15349b9bf
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: jsc#PED-6016

The documentation mentions that non-contiguous bit masks are not
supported in Intel Cache Allocation Technology (CAT).

Update the documentation on how to determine if sparse bit masks are
allowed in L2 and L3 CAT.

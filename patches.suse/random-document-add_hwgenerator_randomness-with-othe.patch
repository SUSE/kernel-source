Subject: [PATCH] random: document add_hwgenerator_randomness() with other
 input functions
Git-commit: 2b6c6e3d9ce3aa0e547ac25d60e06fe035cd9f79
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1

The section at the top of random.c which documents the input functions
available does not document add_hwgenerator_randomness() which might lead
a reader to overlook it. Add a brief note about it.

[Jason: reorganize position of function in doc comment and also document
 add_bootloader_randomness() while we're at it.]

Subject: [PATCH] regmap: Call regmap_debugfs_exit() prior to _init()
Git-commit: 530792efa6cb86f5612ff093333fec735793b582
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: git-fixes

Since commit cffa4b2122f5 ("regmap: debugfs: Fix a memory leak when
calling regmap_attach_dev"), the following debugfs error is seen
on i.MX boards:

Debugfs: Directory 'dummy-iomuxc-gpr@20e0000' with parent 'regmap' already present!

In the attempt to fix the memory leak, the above commit added a NULL check
for map->debugfs_name. For the first debufs entry, map->debugfs_name is NULL
and then the new name is allocated via kasprintf().

For the second debugfs entry, map->debugfs_name() is no longer NULL, so
it will keep using the old entry name and the duplicate name error is seen.

Quoting Mark Brown:

"That means that if the device gets freed we'll end up with the old debugfs
file hanging around pointing at nothing.
...
To be more explicit this means we need a call to regmap_debugfs_exit()
which will clean up all the existing debugfs stuff before we loose
references to it."

Call regmap_debugfs_exit() prior to regmap_debugfs_init() to fix
the problem.

Tested on i.MX6Q and i.MX6SX boards.

Subject: [PATCH] NFS: move generic_write_checks() call from
 nfs_file_direct_write() to nfs_file_write()
Patch-mainline: Not yet - undergoing review
References: bsc#1191876

generic_write_checks() is not needed for swap-out writes, and fails if
they are attempted.
nfs_file_direct_write() currently calls generic_write_checks() and is in
turn called from:
  nfs_direct_IO  - only for swap-out
  nfs_file_write - for normal O_DIRECT write

So move the generic_write_checks() call into nfs_file_write().  This
allows NFS swap-out writes to complete.

Fixes: dc617f29dbe5 ("vfs: don't allow writes to swap files")

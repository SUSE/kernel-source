Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/pmu: Ignore pmu->global_ctrl check if vPMU doesn't
 support global_ctrl

MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL is introduced as part of Architecture PMU V2,
as indicated by Intel SDM 19.2.2 and the intel_is_valid_msr() function.

So in the absence of global_ctrl support, all PMCs are enabled as AMD does.

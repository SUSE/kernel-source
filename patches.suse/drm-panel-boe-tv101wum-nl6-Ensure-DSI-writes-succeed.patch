Subject: [PATCH] drm/panel: boe-tv101wum-nl6: Ensure DSI writes succeed during disable
Git-commit: a3ee9e0b57f8ecca02d1c16fad4941e09bfe2941
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc7
Alt-commit: c913cd5489930abbb557ef144a333846286754c3
References: git-fixes

The unprepare sequence has started to fail after moving to panel bridge
code in the msm drm driver (commit 007ac0262b0d ("drm/msm/dsi: switch to
DRM_PANEL_BRIDGE")). You'll see messages like this in the kernel logs:

   panel-boe-tv101wum-nl6 ae94000.dsi.0: failed to set panel off: -22

This is because boe_panel_enter_sleep_mode() needs an operating DSI link
to set the panel into sleep mode. Performing those writes in the
unprepare phase of bridge ops is too late, because the link has already
been torn down by the DSI controller in post_disable, i.e. the PHY has
been disabled, etc. See dsi_mgr_bridge_post_disable() for more details
on the DSI .

Split the unprepare function into a disable part and an unprepare part.
For now, just the DSI writes to enter sleep mode are put in the disable
function. This fixes the panel off routine and keeps the panel happy.

My Wormdingler has an integrated touchscreen that stops responding to
touch if the panel is only half disabled too. This patch fixes it. And
finally, this saves power when the screen is off because without this
fix the regulators for the panel are left enabled when nothing is being
displayed on the screen.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix wrong mic setup for ASUS VivoBook 15
Git-commit: 9e7c6779e3530bbdd465214afcd13f19c33e51a2
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc5
References: git-fixes

ASUS VivoBook 15 with SSID 1043:1460 took an incorrect quirk via the
pin pattern matching for ASUS (ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC), resulting in
the two built-in mic pins (0x13 and 0x1b).  This had worked without
problems casually in the past because the right pin (0x1b) was picked
up as the primary device.  But since we fixed the pin enumeration for
other bugs, the bogus one (0x13) is picked up as the primary device,
hence the bug surfaced now.

For addressing the regression, this patch explicitly specifies the
quirk entry with ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC_NO_PRESENCE, which sets up only
the headset mic pin.

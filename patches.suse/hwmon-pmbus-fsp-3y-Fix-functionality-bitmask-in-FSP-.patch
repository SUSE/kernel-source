Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (pmbus/fsp-3y) Fix functionality bitmask in FSP-3Y YM-2151E
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: 93822f5161a2dc57a60b95b35b3cb8589f53413e
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

The bit flags in pmbus_driver_info functionality for YM-2151E chip were
joined with a comma operator instead of a bitwise OR. This means that
the last constant PMBUS_HAVE_IIN was not OR-ed with the other
PM_BUS_HAVE_* constants for this page but it initialized the next element
of the func array (which was not accessed from anywhere because of the
number of pages).

However, there is no need for setting PMBUS_HAVE_IIN in the 5Vsb page
because this command does not seem to be paged. Obviously, the device
only has one IIN sensor, so it doesn't make sense to query it again from
the second page.

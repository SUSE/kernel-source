Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: gadget: Ignore End Transfer delay on teardown
Git-commit: c4e3ef5685393c5051b52cf1e94b8891d49793ab
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc3
References: git-fixes

If we delay sending End Transfer for Setup TRB to be prepared, we need
to check if the End Transfer was in preparation for a driver
teardown/soft-disconnect. In those cases, just send the End Transfer
command without delay.

In the case of soft-disconnect, there's a very small chance the command
may not go through immediately. But should it happen, the Setup TRB will
be prepared during the polling of the controller halted state, allowing
the command to go through then.

In the case of disabling endpoint due to reconfiguration (e.g.
set_interface(alt-setting) or usb reset), then it's driven by the host.
Typically the host wouldn't immediately cancel the control request and
send another control transfer to trigger the End Transfer command
timeout.

Subject: [PATCH] i2c: omap: Fix standard mode false ACK readings
Git-commit: c770657bd2611b077ec1e7b1fe6aa92f249399bd
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

Using standard mode, rare false ACK responses were appearing with
i2cdetect tool. This was happening due to NACK interrupt triggering
ISR thread before register access interrupt was ready. Removing the
NACK interrupt's ability to trigger ISR thread lets register access
ready interrupt do this instead.

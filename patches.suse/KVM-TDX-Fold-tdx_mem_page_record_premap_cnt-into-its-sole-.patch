Subject: KVM: TDX: Fold tdx_mem_page_record_premap_cnt() into its sole caller
Git-commit: b4b2b6eda5afa92f42fd1cd67f2729acf7e95f5b
Patch-mainline: v6.19-rc1
References: git-fixes

Fold tdx_mem_page_record_premap_cnt() into tdx_sept_set_private_spte() as
providing a one-off helper for effectively three lines of code is at best a
wash, and splitting the code makes the comment for smp_rmb()  _extremely_
confusing as the comment talks about reading kvm->arch.pre_fault_allowed
before kvm_tdx->state, but the immediately visible code does the exact
opposite.

Opportunistically rewrite the comments to more explicitly explain who is
checking what, as well as _why_ the ordering matters.

No functional change intended.

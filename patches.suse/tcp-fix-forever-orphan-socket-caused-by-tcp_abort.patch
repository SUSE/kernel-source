Subject: tcp: fix forever orphan socket caused by tcp_abort
Git-commit: bac76cf89816bff06c4ec2f3df97dc34e150a1c4
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v6.11-rc6

We have some problem closing zero-window fin-wait-1 tcp sockets in our
environment. This patch come from the investigation.

Previously tcp_abort only sends out reset and calls tcp_done when the
socket is not SOCK_DEAD, aka orphan. For orphan socket, it will only
purging the write queue, but not close the socket and left it to the
timer.

While purging the write queue, tp->packets_out and sk->sk_write_queue
is cleared along the way. However tcp_retransmit_timer have early
return based on !tp->packets_out and tcp_probe_timer have early
return based on !sk->sk_write_queue.

This caused ICSK_TIME_RETRANS and ICSK_TIME_PROBE0 not being resched
and socket not being killed by the timers, converting a zero-windowed
orphan into a forever orphan.

This patch removes the SOCK_DEAD check in tcp_abort, making it send
reset to peer and close the socket accordingly. Preventing the
timer-less orphan from happening.

According to Lorenzo's email in the v1 thread, the check was there to
prevent force-closing the same socket twice. That situation is handled
by testing for TCP_CLOSE inside lock, and returning -ENOENT if it is
already closed.

The -ENOENT code comes from the associate patch Lorenzo made for
iproute2-ss; link attached below, which also conform to RFC 9293.

At the end of the patch, tcp_write_queue_purge(sk) is removed because it
was already called in tcp_done_with_error().

p.s. This is the same patch with v2. Resent due to mis-labeled "changes
requested" on patchwork.kernel.org.

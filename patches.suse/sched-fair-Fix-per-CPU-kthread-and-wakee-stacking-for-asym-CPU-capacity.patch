Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Fix per-CPU kthread and wakee stacking for asym
 CPU capacity

References: bsc#1189999 (Scheduler functional and performance backports)
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-commit: 014ba44e8184e1acf93e0cbb7089ee847802f8f0
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git

select_idle_sibling() has a special case for tasks woken up by a per-CPU
kthread where the selected CPU is the previous one. For asymmetric CPU
capacity systems, the assumption was that the wakee couldn't have a
bigger utilization during task placement than it used to have during the
last activation. That was not considering uclamp.min which can completely
change between two task activations and as a consequence mandates the
fitness criterion asym_fits_capacity(), even for the exit path described
above.

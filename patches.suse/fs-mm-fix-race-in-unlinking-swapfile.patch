Subject: [PATCH] fs, mm: fix race in unlinking swapfile

References: git fixes (mm)
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
Git-commit: 51cc3a6620a6ca934d468bda345678768493f5d8

We had a recurring situation in which admin procedures setting up
swapfiles would race with test preparation clearing away swapfiles; and
just occasionally that got stuck on a swapfile "(deleted)" which could
never be swapped off.  That is not supposed to be possible.

2.6.28 commit f9454548e17c ("don't unlink an active swapfile") admitted
that it was leaving a race window open: now close it.

may_delete() makes the IS_SWAPFILE check (amongst many others) before
inode_lock has been taken on target: now repeat just that simple check in
vfs_unlink() and vfs_rename(), after taking inode_lock.

Which goes most of the way to fixing the race, but swapon() must also
check after it acquires inode_lock, that the file just opened has not
already been unlinked.

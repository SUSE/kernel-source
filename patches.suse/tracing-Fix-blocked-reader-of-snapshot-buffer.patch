Subject: tracing: Fix blocked reader of snapshot buffer
Git-commit: 39a7dc23a1ed0fe81141792a09449d124c5953bd
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc8
References: git-fixes

If an application blocks on the snapshot or snapshot_raw files, expecting
to be woken up when a snapshot occurs, it will not happen. Or it may
happen with an unexpected result.

That result is that the application will be reading the main buffer
instead of the snapshot buffer. That is because when the snapshot occurs,
the main and snapshot buffers are swapped. But the reader has a descriptor
still pointing to the buffer that it originally connected to.

This is fine for the main buffer readers, as they may be blocked waiting
for a watermark to be hit, and when a snapshot occurs, the data that the
main readers want is now on the snapshot buffer.

But for waiters of the snapshot buffer, they are waiting for an event to
occur that will trigger the snapshot and they can then consume it quickly
to save the snapshot before the next snapshot occurs. But to do this, they
need to read the new snapshot buffer, not the old one that is now
receiving new data.

Also, it does not make sense to have a watermark "buffer_percent" on the
snapshot buffer, as the snapshot buffer is static and does not receive new
data except all at once.

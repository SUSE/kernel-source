Subject: [PATCH] net/core: disable NET_RX_BUSY_POLL on PREEMPT_RT
Git-commit: 20ab39d13e2e9f916cf570fc834f2cadd6e5dc4a
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsc#1189998

napi_busy_loop() disables preemption and performs a NAPI poll. We can't acquire
sleeping locks with disabled preemption which would be required while
__napi_poll() invokes the callback of the driver.

A threaded interrupt performing the NAPI-poll can be preempted on PREEMPT_RT.
A RT thread on another CPU may observe NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit set and busy-spin
until it is cleared or its spin time runs out. Given it is the task with the
highest priority it will never observe the NEED_RESCHED bit set.
In this case the time is better spent by simply sleeping.

The NET_RX_BUSY_POLL is disabled by default (the system wide sysctls for
poll/read are set to zero). Disabling NET_RX_BUSY_POLL on PREEMPT_RT to avoid
wrong locking context in case it is used.

Subject: workqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool

Git-commit: e76946110137703c16423baf6ee177b751a34b7e
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc3
References: bsc#1237866 CVE-2025-21786 bsc#1238505

The commit 68f83057b913("workqueue: Reap workers via kthread_stop() and
remove detach_completion") adds code to reap the normal workers but
mistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting
for the rescuer in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug
reported by Cheung Wall.

To avoid the use-after-free bug, the poolâ€™s reference must be held until
the detachment is complete. Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq
after detaching the rescuer from the pool.

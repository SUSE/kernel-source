Subject: fbcon: Fix accelerated fbdev scrolling while logo is still shown
Git-commit: 3866cba87dcd0162fb41e9b3b653d0af68fad5ec
Patch-mainline: v6.0-rc1
References: bsc#1152472

There is no need to directly skip over to the SCROLL_REDRAW case while
the logo is still shown.

When using DRM, this change has no effect because the code will reach
the SCROLL_REDRAW case immediately anyway.

But if you run an accelerated fbdev driver and have
FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_LEGACY_ACCELERATION enabled, console scrolling is
slowed down by factors so that it feels as if you use a 9600 baud
terminal.

So, drop those unnecessary checks and speed up fbdev console
acceleration during bootup.

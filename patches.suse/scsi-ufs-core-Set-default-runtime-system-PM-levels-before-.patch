Subject: scsi: ufs: core: Set default runtime/system PM levels before
 ufshcd_hba_init()
Git-commit: fe06b7c07f3fbcce2a2ca6f7b0d543b5699ea00f
Patch-mainline: v6.14-rc5
References: git-fixes

Commit bb9850704c04 ("scsi: ufs: core: Honor runtime/system PM levels if
set by host controller drivers") introduced the check for setting default
PM levels only if the levels are uninitialized by the host controller
drivers. But it missed the fact that the levels could be initialized to 0
(UFS_PM_LVL_0) on purpose by the controller drivers. Even though none of
the drivers are doing so now, the logic should be fixed irrespectively.

So set the default levels unconditionally before calling ufshcd_hba_init()
API which initializes the controller drivers. It ensures that the
controller drivers could override the default levels if required.

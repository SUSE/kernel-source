Subject: [PATCH] cxl/cxl-event: include missing <linux/types.h> and
 <linux/uuid.h>
Git-commit: 0e081a0ec04df58ac9caec1916ae6d9d048d50a7
Patch-mainline: v6.10-rc1
References: jsc#PED-10836

The linux/cxl-event.h header file uses the u8, u16, and uuid_t types,
but it doesn't include the necessary header files,
<linux/types.h> and <linux/uuid.h>.

Currently, cxl-event.h is only used by drivers/cxl/cxlmem.h,
and it doesn't cause any errors because cxlmem.h indirectly
includes the required types.

However, cxl-event.h may be used by other CXL-related code in the future,
so it's important to fix this issue by including the missing header files
directly in cxl-event.h.

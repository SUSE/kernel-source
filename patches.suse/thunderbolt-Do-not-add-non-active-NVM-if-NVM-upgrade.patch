Subject: [PATCH] thunderbolt: Do not add non-active NVM if NVM upgrade is disabled for retimer
Git-commit: ad79c278e478ca8c1a3bf8e7a0afba8f862a48a1
Patch-mainline: v6.15-rc1
References: stable-fixes

This is only used to write a new NVM in order to upgrade the retimer
firmware. It does not make sense to expose it if upgrade is disabled.
This also makes it consistent with the router NVM upgrade.

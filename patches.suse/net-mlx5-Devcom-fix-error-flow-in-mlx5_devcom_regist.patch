Subject: net/mlx5: Devcom, fix error flow in mlx5_devcom_register_device
Patch-mainline: v6.4-rc4
Git-commit: af87194352cad882d787d06fb7efa714acd95427
References: jsc#PED-1549

In case devcom allocation is failed, mlx5 is always freeing the priv.
However, this priv might have been allocated by a different thread,
and freeing it might lead to use-after-free bugs.
Fix it by freeing the priv only in case it was allocated by the
running thread.

Fixes: fadd59fc50d0 ("net/mlx5: Introduce inter-device communication mechanism")

Subject: perf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() fail
Git-commit: 07091aade394f690e7b655578140ef84d0e8d7b0
Patch-mainline: v6.17-rc1
References: CVE-2025-38563 bsc#1248306 dependency CVE-2025-38565 bsc#1248377

When perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes the
event_mapped() callback of the related event. On X86 this might increase
the perf_rdpmc_allowed reference counter. But nothing undoes this as
perf_mmap_close() is never called in this case, which causes another
reference count leak.

Return early on failure to prevent that.

Fixes: 1e0fb9ec679c ("perf: Add pmu callbacks to track event mapping and unmapping")

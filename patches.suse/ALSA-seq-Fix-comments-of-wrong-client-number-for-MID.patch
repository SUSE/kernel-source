Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: seq: Fix comments of wrong client number for MIDI Passthrough
Git-commit: c5aa8277a1d388ba634f756473ee63017708f9c6
Patch-mainline: v5.15-rc1
References: bsc#1192354

MIDI Passthrough sequencer client is assigned always to the fixed
number 14, while it's wrongly documented in the comments as if 62,
which was an old number that was used during development.  Fix all
those numbers.

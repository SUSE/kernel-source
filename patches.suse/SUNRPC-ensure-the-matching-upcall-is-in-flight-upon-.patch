Subject: [PATCH] SUNRPC: ensure the matching upcall is in-flight upon downcall
Git-commit: b18cba09e374637a0a3759d856a6bca94c133952
Patch-mainline: v6.2
References: git-fixes

Commit 9130b8dbc6ac ("SUNRPC: allow for upcalls for the same uid
but different gss service") introduced `auth` argument to
__gss_find_upcall(), but in gss_pipe_downcall() it was left as NULL
since it (and auth->service) was not (yet) determined.

When multiple upcalls with the same uid and different service are
ongoing, it could happen that __gss_find_upcall(), which returns the
first match found in the pipe->in_downcall list, could not find the
correct gss_msg corresponding to the downcall we are looking for.
Moreover, it might return a msg which is not sent to rpc.gssd yet.

We could see mount.nfs process hung in D state with multiple mount.nfs
are executed in parallel.  The call trace below is of CentOS 7.9
kernel-3.10.0-1160.24.1.el7.x86_64 but we observed the same hang w/
elrepo kernel-ml-6.0.7-1.el7.

The scenario is like this. Let's say there are two upcalls for
services A and B, A -> B in pipe->in_downcall, B -> A in pipe->pipe.

When rpc.gssd reads pipe to get the upcall msg corresponding to
service B from pipe->pipe and then writes the response, in
gss_pipe_downcall the msg corresponding to service A will be picked
because only uid is used to find the msg and it is before the one for
B in pipe->in_downcall.  And the process waiting for the msg
corresponding to service A will be woken up.

Actual scheduing of that process might be after rpc.gssd processes the
next msg.  In rpc_pipe_generic_upcall it clears msg->errno (for A).
The process is scheduled to see gss_msg->ctx == NULL and
gss_msg->msg.errno == 0, therefore it cannot break the loop in
gss_create_upcall and is never woken up after that.

This patch adds a simple check to ensure that a msg which is not
sent to rpc.gssd yet is not chosen as the matching upcall upon
receiving a downcall.

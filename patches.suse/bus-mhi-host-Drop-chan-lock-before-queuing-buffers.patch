Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: host: Drop chan lock before queuing buffers
Git-commit: 01bd694ac2f682fb8017e16148b928482bc8fa4b
Patch-mainline: v6.8-rc1
References: git-fixes

Ensure read and write locks for the channel are not taken in succession by
dropping the read lock from parse_xfer_event() such that a callback given
to client can potentially queue buffers and acquire the write lock in that
process. Any queueing of buffers should be done without channel read lock
acquired as it can result in multiple locks and a soft lockup.

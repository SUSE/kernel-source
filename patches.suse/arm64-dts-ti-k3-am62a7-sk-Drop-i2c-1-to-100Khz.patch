Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62a7-sk: Drop i2c-1 to 100Khz
Git-commit: 63e5aa69b821472a3203a29e17c025329c1b151f
Patch-mainline: v6.7-rc1
References: git-fixes

The TLV320AIC3106 audio codec is interfaced on the i2c-1 bus. With the
default rate of 400Khz the i2c register writes fail to sync:

[   36.026387] tlv320aic3x 1-001b: Unable to sync registers 0x16-0x16. -110
[   38.101130] omap_i2c 20010000.i2c: controller timed out

Dropping the rate to 100Khz fixes the issue.

Subject: sched: Consider task_struct::saved_state in wait_task_inactive().

Git-commit: 05cc83ce76f16277cc30610095a69b90bf83fb5d
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
References: SLE Realtime Extension
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel.git

wait_task_inactive() waits for thread to unschedule in a certain task state.
On PREEMPT_RT that state may be stored in task_struct::saved_state while the
thread, that is being waited for, blocks on a sleeping lock and
task_struct::__state is set to TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT.
It is not possible to check only for TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT to be sure that the task
is blocked on a sleeping lock because during wake up (after the sleeping lock
has been acquired) the task state is set TASK_RUNNING. After the task in on CPU
and acquired the pi_lock it will reset the state accordingly but until then
TASK_RUNNING will be observed (with the desired state is saved in saved_state).

Check also for task_struct::saved_state if the desired match was not found in
task_struct::__state on PREEMPT_RT. If the state was found in saved_state, wait
until the task is idle and state is visible in task_struct::__state.

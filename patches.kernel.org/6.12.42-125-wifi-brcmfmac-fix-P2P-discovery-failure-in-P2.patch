Subject: [PATCH] wifi: brcmfmac: fix P2P discovery failure in P2P peer due to
 missing P2P IE
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.42
Git-commit: 579bf8037b70b644a674c126a32bbb2212cf5c21

[ Upstream commit 579bf8037b70b644a674c126a32bbb2212cf5c21 ]

After commit bd99a3013bdc ("brcmfmac: move configuration of probe request
IEs"), the probe request MGMT IE addition operation brcmf_vif_set_mgmt_ie()
got moved from the brcmf_p2p_scan_prep() to the brcmf_cfg80211_scan().

Because of this, as part of the scan request handler for the P2P Discovery,
vif struct used for adding the Probe Request P2P IE in firmware got changed
from the P2PAPI_BSSCFG_DEVICE vif to P2PAPI_BSSCFG_PRIMARY vif incorrectly.
So the firmware stopped adding P2P IE to the outgoing P2P Discovery probe
requests frames and the other P2P peers were unable to discover this device
causing a regression on the P2P feature.

To fix this, while setting the P2P IE in firmware, properly use the vif of
the P2P discovery wdev on which the driver received the P2P scan request.
This is done by not changing the vif pointer, until brcmf_vif_set_mgmt_ie()
is completed.

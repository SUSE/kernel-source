Subject: [PATCH] cxl/region: Fix passthrough-decoder detection
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.12
Git-commit: 711442e29f16f0d39dd0e2460c9baacfccb9d5a7

commit 711442e29f16f0d39dd0e2460c9baacfccb9d5a7 upstream.

A passthrough decoder is a decoder that maps only 1 target. It is a
special case because it does not impose any constraints on the
interleave-math as compared to a decoder with multiple targets. Extend
the passthrough case to multi-target-capable decoders that only have one
target selected. I.e. the current code was only considering passthrough
*ports* which are only a subset of the potential passthrough decoder
scenarios.

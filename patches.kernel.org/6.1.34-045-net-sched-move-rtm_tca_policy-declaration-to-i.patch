Subject: [PATCH] net: sched: move rtm_tca_policy declaration to include file
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.34
Git-commit: 886bc7d6ed3357975c5f1d3c784da96000d4bbb4

[ Upstream commit 886bc7d6ed3357975c5f1d3c784da96000d4bbb4 ]

rtm_tca_policy is used from net/sched/sch_api.c and net/sched/cls_api.c,
thus should be declared in an include file.

This fixes the following sparse warning:
net/sched/sch_api.c:1434:25: warning: symbol 'rtm_tca_policy' was not declared. Should it be static?

Fixes: e331473fee3d ("net/sched: cls_api: add missing validation of netlink attributes")

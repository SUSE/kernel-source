Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: Skip resume if pm_runtime_set_active() fails
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: e3a9bd247cddfb6fa0c29c2361f70b76c359eaa0

commit e3a9bd247cddfb6fa0c29c2361f70b76c359eaa0 upstream.

When the system begins to enter suspend mode, dwc3_suspend() is called
by PM suspend. There is a problem that if someone interrupt the system
suspend process between dwc3_suspend() and pm_suspend() of its parent
device, PM suspend will be canceled and attempt to resume suspended
devices so that dwc3_resume() will be called. However, dwc3 and its
parent device (like the power domain or glue driver) may already be
suspended by runtime PM in fact. If this sutiation happened, the
pm_runtime_set_active() in dwc3_resume() will return an error since
parent device was suspended. This can lead to unexpected behavior if
DWC3 proceeds to execute dwc3_resume_common().

EX.
RPM suspend: ... -> dwc3_runtime_suspend()
                      -> rpm_suspend() of parent device
...
PM suspend: ... -> dwc3_suspend() -> pm_suspend of parent device
                                 ^ interrupt, so resume suspended device
          ...  <-  dwc3_resume()  <-/
                      ^ pm_runtime_set_active() returns error

To prevent the problem, this commit will skip dwc3_resume_common() and
return the error if pm_runtime_set_active() fails.

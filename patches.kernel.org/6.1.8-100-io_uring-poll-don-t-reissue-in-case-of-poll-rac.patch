Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/poll: don't reissue in case of poll race on
 multishot request
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.8
Git-commit: 8caa03f10bf92cb8657408a6ece6a8a73f96ce13

commit 8caa03f10bf92cb8657408a6ece6a8a73f96ce13 upstream.

A previous commit fixed a poll race that can occur, but it's only
applicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request, we can safely
ignore a spurious wakeup, as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.

A blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a
buffer, if they are ring provided. While this seems like a bug in itself,
it's not really defined behavior to reissue a multishot request directly.
It's less efficient to do so as well, and not required to rearm anything
like it is for singleshot poll requests.

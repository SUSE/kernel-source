Subject: [PATCH] media: ov5640: fix low resolution image abnormal issue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: a828002f38c5ee49d3f0c0e64c0f0caa1aec8dc2

[ Upstream commit a828002f38c5ee49d3f0c0e64c0f0caa1aec8dc2 ]

OV5640 will output abnormal image data when work at low resolution
(320x240, 176x144 and 160x120) after switching from high resolution,
such as 1080P, the time interval between high and low switching must
be less than 1000ms in order to OV5640 don't enter suspend state during
the time.

The reason is by 0x3824 value don't restore to initialize value when
do resolution switching. In high resolution setting array, 0x3824 is
set to 0x04, but low resolution setting array remove 0x3824 in commit
db15c1957a2d ("media: ov5640: Remove duplicated mode settings"). So
when do resolution switching from high to low, such as 1080P to 320x240,
and the time interval is less than auto suspend delay time which means
global initialize setting array will not be loaded, the output image
data are abnormal. Hence move 0x3824 from ov5640_init_setting[] table
to ov5640_setting_low_res[] table and also move 0x4407 0x460b, 0x460c
to avoid same issue.

Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: host: Fix race between channel preparation and M0
 event
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.4
Git-commit: 869a99907faea6d1835b0bd0d0422ae3519c6ea9

commit 869a99907faea6d1835b0bd0d0422ae3519c6ea9 upstream.

There is a race condition where mhi_prepare_channel() updates the
read and write pointers as the base address and in parallel, if
an M0 transition occurs, the tasklet goes ahead and rings
doorbells for all channels with a delta in TRE rings assuming
they are already enabled. This causes a null pointer access. Fix
it by adding a channel enabled check before ringing channel
doorbells.

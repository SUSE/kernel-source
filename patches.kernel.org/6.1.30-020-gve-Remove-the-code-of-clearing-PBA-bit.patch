Subject: [PATCH] gve: Remove the code of clearing PBA bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: f4c2e67c1773d2a2632381ee30e9139c1e744c16

[ Upstream commit f4c2e67c1773d2a2632381ee30e9139c1e744c16 ]

Clearing the PBA bit from the driver is race prone and it may lead to
dropped interrupt events. This could potentially lead to the traffic
being completely halted.

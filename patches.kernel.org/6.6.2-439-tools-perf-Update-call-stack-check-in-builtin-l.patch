Subject: [PATCH] tools/perf: Update call stack check in builtin-lock.c
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit d7c9ae8d5d1be0c4156d1e20e4369a77b711a4cc ]

The perf test named "kernel lock contention analysis test"
fails in powerpc system with below error:

  [command]# ./perf test 81 -vv
   81: kernel lock contention analysis test                            :
   --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 2140
  Testing perf lock record and perf lock contention
  Testing perf lock contention --use-bpf
  [Skip] No BPF support

  Testing perf lock contention --callstack-filter (w/ unix_stream)
  [Fail] Recorded result should have a lock from unix_stream:
  test child finished with -1
   ---- end ----
  kernel lock contention analysis test: FAILED!

The test is failing because we get an address entry with 0 in
perf lock samples for powerpc, and code for lock contention
option "--callstack-filter" will not check further entries after
address 0.

Below are some of the samples from test generated perf.data file, which
have 0 address in the 2nd entry of callstack:

 --------

Based on commit 20002ded4d93 ("perf_counter: powerpc: Add callchain support"),
incase of powerpc, the callchain saved by kernel always includes first
three entries as the NIP (next instruction pointer), LR (link register), and
the contents of LR save area in the second stack frame. In certain scenarios
its possible to have invalid kernel instruction addresses in either of LR or the
second stack frame's LR. In that case, kernel will store the address as zer0.
Hence, its possible to have 2nd or 3rd callstack entry as 0.

As per the current code in match_callstack_filter function, we skip the callstack
check incase we get 0 address. And hence the test case is failing in powerpc.

Fix this issue by updating the check in match_callstack_filter function,
to not skip callstack check if the 2nd or 3rd entry have 0 address
for powerpc.

Result in powerpc after patch changes:

  [command]# ./perf test 81 -vv

  kernel lock contention analysis test: Ok

Subject: [PATCH] mm/thp: simplify copying of huge zero page pmd when fork
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.5
Git-commit: 5fc7a5f6fd04bc18f309d9f979b32ef7d1d0a997

commit 5fc7a5f6fd04bc18f309d9f979b32ef7d1d0a997 upstream.

Patch series "mm/uffd: Misc fix for uffd-wp and one more test".

This series tries to fix some corner case bugs for uffd-wp on either thp
or fork().  Then it introduced a new test with pagemap/pageout.

Patch layout:

Patch 1:    cleanup for THP, it'll slightly simplify the follow up patches
Patch 2-4:  misc fixes for uffd-wp here and there; please refer to each patch
Patch 5:    add pagemap support for uffd-wp
Patch 6:    add pagemap/pageout test for uffd-wp

The last test introduced can also verify some of the fixes in previous
patches, as the test will fail without the fixes.  However it's not easy
to verify all the changes in patch 2-4, but hopefully they can still be
properly reviewed.

Note that if considering the ongoing uffd-wp shmem & hugetlbfs work, patch
5 will be incomplete as it's missing e.g.  hugetlbfs part or the special
swap pte detection.  However that's not needed in this series, and since
that series is still during review, this series does not depend on that
one (the last test only runs with anonymous memory, not file-backed).  So
this series can be merged even before that series.

This patch (of 6):

Huge zero page is handled in a special path in copy_huge_pmd(), however it
should share most codes with a normal thp page.  Trying to share more code
with it by removing the special path.  The only leftover so far is the
huge zero page refcounting (mm_get_huge_zero_page()), because that's
separately done with a global counter.

This prepares for a future patch to modify the huge pmd to be installed,
so that we don't need to duplicate it explicitly into huge zero page case
too.

Subject: [PATCH] dlm: fix removal of rsb struct that is master and dir record
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: 134129520beaf3339482c557361ea0bde709cf36

[ Upstream commit 134129520beaf3339482c557361ea0bde709cf36 ]

An rsb struct was not being removed in the case where it
was both the master and the dir record.  This case (master
and dir node) was missed in the condition for doing add_scan()
from deactivate_rsb().  Fixing this triggers a related WARN_ON
that needs to be fixed, and requires adjusting where two
del_scan() calls are made.

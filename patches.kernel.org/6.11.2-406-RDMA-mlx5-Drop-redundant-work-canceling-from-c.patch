Subject: [PATCH] RDMA/mlx5: Drop redundant work canceling from clean_keys()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.2
Git-commit: 30e6bd8d3b5639f8f4261e5e6c0917ce264b8dc2

[ Upstream commit 30e6bd8d3b5639f8f4261e5e6c0917ce264b8dc2 ]

The canceling of dealyed work in clean_keys() is a leftover from years
back and was added to prevent races in the cleanup process of MR cache.
The cleanup process was rewritten a few years ago and the canceling of
delayed work and flushing of workqueue was added before the call to
clean_keys().

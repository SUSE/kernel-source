Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpu/vfm: Add/initialize x86_vfm field to struct
 cpuinfo_x86
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.69
Git-commit: a9d0adce69075192961f3be466c4810a21b7bc9e

[ Upstream commit a9d0adce69075192961f3be466c4810a21b7bc9e ]

Refactor struct cpuinfo_x86 so that the vendor, family, and model
fields are overlaid in a union with a 32-bit field that combines
all three (together with a one byte reserved field in the upper
byte).

This will make it easy, cheap, and reliable to check all three
values at once.

See

  https://lore.kernel.org/r/Zgr6kT8oULbnmEXx@agluck-desk3

for why the ordering is (low-to-high bits):

  (vendor, family, model)

  [ bp: Move comments over the line, add the backstory about the
    particular order of the fields. ]

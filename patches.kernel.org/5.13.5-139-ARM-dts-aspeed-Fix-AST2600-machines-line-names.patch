Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed: Fix AST2600 machines line names
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.5
Git-commit: ca46ad2214473df1a6a9496be17156d65ba89b9f

commit ca46ad2214473df1a6a9496be17156d65ba89b9f upstream.

Tacoma and Rainier both have a line-names array that is too long:

 gpio gpiochip0: gpio-line-names is length 232 but should be at most length 208

This was probably copied from an AST2500 device tree that did have more
GPIOs on the controller.

Fixes: e9b24b55ca4f ("ARM: dts: aspeed: rainier: Add gpio line names")
Fixes: 2f68e4e7df67 ("ARM: dts: aspeed: tacoma: Add gpio line names")

Subject: [PATCH] floppy: Fix hang in watchdog when disk is ejected
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.3
Git-commit: fb48febce7e30baed94dd791e19521abd2c3fd83

[ Upstream commit fb48febce7e30baed94dd791e19521abd2c3fd83 ]

When the watchdog detects a disk change, it calls cancel_activity(),
which in turn tries to cancel the fd_timer delayed work.

In the above scenario, fd_timer_fn is set to fd_watchdog(), meaning
it is trying to cancel its own work.
This results in a hang as cancel_delayed_work_sync() is waiting for the
watchdog (itself) to return, which never happens.

This can be reproduced relatively consistently by attempting to read a
broken floppy, and ejecting it while IO is being attempted and retried.

To resolve this, this patch calls cancel_delayed_work() instead, which
cancels the work without waiting for the watchdog to return and finish.

Before this regression was introduced, the code in this section used
del_timer(), and not del_timer_sync() to delete the watchdog timer.

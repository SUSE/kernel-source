Subject: [PATCH] drm/panthor: Record devfreq busy as soon as a job is started
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 896868eded124059023be0af92d68cdaf9b4de70

[ Upstream commit 896868eded124059023be0af92d68cdaf9b4de70 ]

If a queue is already assigned to the hardware, then a newly submitted
job can start straight away without waiting for the tick. However in
this case the devfreq infrastructure isn't notified that the GPU is
busy. By the time the tick happens the job might well have finished and
no time will be accounted for the GPU being busy.

Fix this by recording the GPU as busy directly in queue_run_job() in the
case where there is a CSG assigned and therefore we just ring the
doorbell.

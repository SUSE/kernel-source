Subject: [PATCH] net: plip: fix break; causing plip to never transmit
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.59
Git-commit: f99cf996ba5a315f8b9f13cc21dff0604a0eb749

[ Upstream commit f99cf996ba5a315f8b9f13cc21dff0604a0eb749 ]

Since commit
  71ae2cb30531 ("net: plip: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang")

plip was not able to send any packets, this patch replaces one
unintended break; with fallthrough; which was originally missed by
commit 9525d69a3667 ("net: plip: mark expected switch fall-throughs").

I have verified with a real hardware PLIP connection that everything
works once again after applying this patch.

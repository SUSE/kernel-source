Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: pm8350c: Drop PWM reg declaration
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: eeca7d46217ccfe9289530e959c0fb29190af0d6

[ Upstream commit eeca7d46217ccfe9289530e959c0fb29190af0d6 ]

The PWM is a part of the SPMI PMIC block and maps several different
addresses within the SPMI block. It is not accurate to describe as pwm@reg
as a result.

Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add Tigerlake support in no-HWP mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 71bb5c82aaaea007167f3ba68d3a669c74d7d55d

[ Upstream commit 71bb5c82aaaea007167f3ba68d3a669c74d7d55d ]

Users may disable HWP in firmware, in which case intel_pstate wouldn't load
unless the CPU model is explicitly supported.

Add TIGERLAKE to the list of CPUs that can register intel_pstate while not
advertising the HWP capability. Without this change, an TIGERLAKE in no-HWP
mode could only use the acpi_cpufreq frequency scaling driver.

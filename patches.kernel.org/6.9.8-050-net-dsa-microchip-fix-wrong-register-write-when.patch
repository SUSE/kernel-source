Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: microchip: fix wrong register write when masking
 interrupt
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.8
Git-commit: b1c4b4d45263241ec6c2405a8df8265d4b58e707

[ Upstream commit b1c4b4d45263241ec6c2405a8df8265d4b58e707 ]

The switch global port interrupt mask, REG_SW_PORT_INT_MASK__4, is
defined as 0x001C in ksz9477_reg.h.  The designers used 32-bit value in
anticipation for increase of port count in future product but currently
the maximum port count is 7 and the effective value is 0x7F in register
0x001F.  Each port has its own interrupt mask and is defined as 0x#01F.
It uses only 4 bits for different interrupts.

The developer who implemented the current interrupt mechanism in the
switch driver noticed there are similarities between the mechanism to
mask port interrupts in global interrupt and individual interrupts in
each port and so used the same code to handle these interrupts.  He
updated the code to use the new macro REG_SW_PORT_INT_MASK__1 which is
defined as 0x1F in ksz_common.h but he forgot to update the 32-bit write
to 8-bit as now the mask registers are 0x1F and 0x#01F.

In addition all KSZ switches other than the KSZ9897/KSZ9893 and LAN937X
families use only 8-bit access and so this common code will eventually
be changed to accommodate them.

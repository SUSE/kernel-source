Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8180x: Fix ss_phy_irq for secondary USB
 controller
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.9
Git-commit: ecda8309098402f878c96184f29a1b7ec682d772

[ Upstream commit ecda8309098402f878c96184f29a1b7ec682d772 ]

The ACPI DSDT of the Surface Pro X (SQ2) specifies the interrupts for
the secondary UBS controller as

    Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate ()
    {
        Interrupt (ResourceConsumer, Level, ActiveHigh, Shared, ,, )
        {
            0x000000AA,
        }
        Interrupt (ResourceConsumer, Level, ActiveHigh, SharedAndWake, ,, )
        {
            0x000000A7,     // hs_phy_irq: &intc GIC_SPI 136
        }
        Interrupt (ResourceConsumer, Level, ActiveHigh, SharedAndWake, ,, )
        {
            0x00000228,     // ss_phy_irq: &pdc 40
        }
        Interrupt (ResourceConsumer, Edge, ActiveHigh, SharedAndWake, ,, )
        {
            0x0000020A,     // dm_hs_phy_irq: &pdc 10
        }
        Interrupt (ResourceConsumer, Edge, ActiveHigh, SharedAndWake, ,, )
        {
            0x0000020B,     // dp_hs_phy_irq: &pdc 11
        }
    })

Generally, the interrupts above 0x200 map to the PDC interrupts (as used
in the devicetree) as ACPI_NUMBER - 0x200. Note that this lines up with
dm_hs_phy_irq and dp_hs_phy_irq (as well as the interrupts for the
primary USB controller).

Based on the snippet above, ss_phy_irq should therefore be PDC 40 (=
0x28) and not PDC 7. The latter is according to ACPI instead used as
ss_phy_irq for port 0 of the multiport USB controller). Fix this by
setting ss_phy_irq to '&pdc 40'.

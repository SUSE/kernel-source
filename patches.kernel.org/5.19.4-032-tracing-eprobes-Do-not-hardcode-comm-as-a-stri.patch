Subject: [PATCH] tracing/eprobes: Do not hardcode $comm as a string
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: 02333de90e5945e2fe7fc75b15b4eb9aee187f0a

commit 02333de90e5945e2fe7fc75b15b4eb9aee187f0a upstream.

The variable $comm is hard coded as a string, which is true for both
kprobes and uprobes, but for event probes (eprobes) it is a field name. In
most cases the "comm" field would be a string, but there's no guarantee of
that fact.

Do not assume that comm is a string. Not to mention, it currently forces
comm fields to fault, as string processing for event probes is currently
broken.

Subject: [PATCH] ibmvnic: Properly dispose of all skbs during a failover.
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.11
Git-commit: 1b18f09d31cfa7148df15a7d5c5e0e86f105f7d1

[ Upstream commit 1b18f09d31cfa7148df15a7d5c5e0e86f105f7d1 ]

During a reset, there may have been transmits in flight that are no
longer valid and cannot be fulfilled.  Resetting and clearing the
queues is insufficient; each skb also needs to be explicitly freed
so that upper levels are not left waiting for confirmation of a
transmit that will never happen.  If this happens frequently enough,
the apparent backlog will cause TCP to begin "congestion control"
unnecessarily, culminating in permanently decreased throughput.

Fixes: d7c0ef36bde03 ("ibmvnic: Free and re-allocate scrqs when tx/rx scrqs change")

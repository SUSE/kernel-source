Subject: [PATCH] locking/mutex: Fix HANDOFF condition
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.4
Git-commit: 048661a1f963e9517630f080687d48af79ed784c

[ Upstream commit 048661a1f963e9517630f080687d48af79ed784c ]

Yanfei reported that setting HANDOFF should not depend on recomputing
@first, only on @first state. Which would then give:

  if (ww_ctx || !first)
    first = __mutex_waiter_is_first(lock, &waiter);
  if (first)
    __mutex_set_flag(lock, MUTEX_FLAG_HANDOFF);

But because 'ww_ctx || !first' is basically 'always' and the test for
first is relatively cheap, omit that first branch entirely.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: fix NULL pointer dereference
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.6
Git-commit: fc68f42aa737dc15e7665a4101d4168aadb8e4c4

commit fc68f42aa737dc15e7665a4101d4168aadb8e4c4 upstream.

Commit 71f642833284 ("ACPI: utils: Fix reference counting in
for_each_acpi_dev_match()") started doing "acpi_dev_put()" on a pointer
that was possibly NULL.  That fails miserably, because that helper
inline function is not set up to handle that case.

Just make acpi_dev_put() silently accept a NULL pointer, rather than
calling down to put_device() with an invalid offset off that NULL
pointer.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix per-subvolume RO/RW flags with new mount API
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: cda7163d4e3d99db93aa38f0e825b8433c7a8452

commit cda7163d4e3d99db93aa38f0e825b8433c7a8452 upstream.

[BUG]
With util-linux 2.40.2, the 'mount' utility is already utilizing the new
mount API. e.g:

  # strace  mount -o subvol=subv1,ro /dev/test/scratch1 /mnt/test/
  ...
  fsconfig(3, FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "source", "/dev/mapper/test-scratch1", 0) = 0
  fsconfig(3, FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "subvol", "subv1", 0) = 0
  fsconfig(3, FSCONFIG_SET_FLAG, "ro", NULL, 0) = 0
  fsconfig(3, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, NULL, NULL, 0) = 0
  fsmount(3, FSMOUNT_CLOEXEC, 0)          = 4
  mount_setattr(4, "", AT_EMPTY_PATH, {attr_set=MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY, attr_clr=0, propagation=0 /* MS_??? */, userns_fd=0}, 32) = 0
  move_mount(4, "", AT_FDCWD, "/mnt/test", MOVE_MOUNT_F_EMPTY_PATH) = 0

But this leads to a new problem, that per-subvolume RO/RW mount no
longer works, if the initial mount is RO:

  # mount -o subvol=subv1,ro /dev/test/scratch1 /mnt/test
  # mount -o rw,subvol=subv2 /dev/test/scratch1  /mnt/scratch
  # mount | grep mnt
  /dev/mapper/test-scratch1 on /mnt/test type btrfs (ro,relatime,discard=async,space_cache=v2,subvolid=256,subvol=/subv1)
  /dev/mapper/test-scratch1 on /mnt/scratch type btrfs (ro,relatime,discard=async,space_cache=v2,subvolid=257,subvol=/subv2)
  # touch /mnt/scratch/foobar
  touch: cannot touch '/mnt/scratch/foobar': Read-only file system

This is a common use cases on distros.

[CAUSE]
We have a workaround for remount to handle the RO->RW change, but if the
mount is using the new mount API, we do not do that, and rely on the
mount tool NOT to set the ro flag.

But that's not how the mount tool is doing for the new API:

  fsconfig(3, FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "source", "/dev/mapper/test-scratch1", 0) = 0
  fsconfig(3, FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "subvol", "subv1", 0) = 0
  fsconfig(3, FSCONFIG_SET_FLAG, "ro", NULL, 0) = 0       <<<< Setting RO flag for super block
  fsconfig(3, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, NULL, NULL, 0) = 0
  fsmount(3, FSMOUNT_CLOEXEC, 0)          = 4
  mount_setattr(4, "", AT_EMPTY_PATH, {attr_set=MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY, attr_clr=0, propagation=0 /* MS_??? */, userns_fd=0}, 32) = 0
  move_mount(4, "", AT_FDCWD, "/mnt/test", MOVE_MOUNT_F_EMPTY_PATH) = 0

This means we will set the super block RO at the first mount.

Later RW mount will not try to reconfigure the fs to RW because the
mount tool is already using the new API.

This totally breaks the per-subvolume RO/RW mount behavior.

[FIX]
Do not skip the reconfiguration even if using the new API.  The old
comments are just expecting any mount tool to properly skip the RO flag
set even if we specify "ro", which is not the reality.

Update the comments regarding the backward compatibility on the kernel
level so it works with old and new mount utilities.

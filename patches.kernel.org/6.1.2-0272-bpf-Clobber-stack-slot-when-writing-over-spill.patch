Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Clobber stack slot when writing over spilled
 PTR_TO_BTF_ID
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 261f4664caffdeb9dff4e83ee3c0334b1c3a552f

[ Upstream commit 261f4664caffdeb9dff4e83ee3c0334b1c3a552f ]

When support was added for spilled PTR_TO_BTF_ID to be accessed by
helper memory access, the stack slot was not overwritten to STACK_MISC
(and that too is only safe when env->allow_ptr_leaks is true).

This means that helpers who take ARG_PTR_TO_MEM and write to it may
essentially overwrite the value while the verifier continues to track
the slot for spilled register.

This can cause issues when PTR_TO_BTF_ID is spilled to stack, and then
overwritten by helper write access, which can then be passed to BPF
helpers or kfuncs.

Handle this by falling back to the case introduced in a later commit,
which will also handle PTR_TO_BTF_ID along with other pointer types,
i.e. cd17d38f8b28 ("bpf: Permits pointers on stack for helper calls").

Finally, include a comment on why REG_LIVE_WRITTEN is not being set when
clobber is set to true. In short, the reason is that while when clobber
is unset, we know that we won't be writing, when it is true, we *may*
write to any of the stack slots in that range. It may be a partial or
complete write, to just one or many stack slots.

We cannot be sure, hence to be conservative, we leave things as is and
never set REG_LIVE_WRITTEN for any stack slot. However, clobber still
needs to reset them to STACK_MISC assuming writes happened. However read
marks still need to be propagated upwards from liveness point of view,
as parent stack slot's contents may still continue to matter to child
states.

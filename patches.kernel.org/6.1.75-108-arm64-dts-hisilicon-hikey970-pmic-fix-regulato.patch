Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: hisilicon: hikey970-pmic: fix regulator cells
 properties
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: 44ab3ee76a5a977864ba0bb6c352dcf6206804e0

[ Upstream commit 44ab3ee76a5a977864ba0bb6c352dcf6206804e0 ]

The Hi6421 PMIC regulator child nodes do not have unit addresses so drop
the incorrect '#address-cells' and '#size-cells' properties.

Fixes: 6219b20e1ecd ("arm64: dts: hisilicon: Add support for Hikey 970 PMIC")

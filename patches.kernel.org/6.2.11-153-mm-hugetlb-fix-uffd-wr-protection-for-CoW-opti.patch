Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: fix uffd wr-protection for CoW optimization path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.11
Git-commit: 60d5b473d61be61ac315e544fcd6a8234a79500e

commit 60d5b473d61be61ac315e544fcd6a8234a79500e upstream.

This patch fixes an issue that a hugetlb uffd-wr-protected mapping can be
writable even with uffd-wp bit set.  It only happens with hugetlb private
mappings, when someone firstly wr-protects a missing pte (which will
install a pte marker), then a write to the same page without any prior
access to the page.

Userfaultfd-wp trap for hugetlb was implemented in hugetlb_fault() before
reaching hugetlb_wp() to avoid taking more locks that userfault won't
need.  However there's one CoW optimization path that can trigger
hugetlb_wp() inside hugetlb_no_page(), which will bypass the trap.

This patch skips hugetlb_wp() for CoW and retries the fault if uffd-wp bit
is detected.  The new path will only trigger in the CoW optimization path
because generic hugetlb_fault() (e.g.  when a present pte was
wr-protected) will resolve the uffd-wp bit already.  Also make sure
anonymous UNSHARE won't be affected and can still be resolved, IOW only
skip CoW not CoR.

This patch will be needed for v5.19+ hence copy stable.

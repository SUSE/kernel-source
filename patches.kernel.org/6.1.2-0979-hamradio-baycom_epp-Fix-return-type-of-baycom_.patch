Subject: [PATCH] hamradio: baycom_epp: Fix return type of baycom_send_packet()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: c5733e5b15d91ab679646ec3149e192996a27d5d

[ Upstream commit c5733e5b15d91ab679646ec3149e192996a27d5d ]

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
reveals:

  drivers/net/hamradio/baycom_epp.c:1119:25: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' (aka 'enum netdev_tx (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)') with an expression of type 'int (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]
          .ndo_start_xmit      = baycom_send_packet,
                                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 error generated.

->ndo_start_xmit() in 'struct net_device_ops' expects a return type of
'netdev_tx_t', not 'int'. Adjust the return type of baycom_send_packet()
to match the prototype's to resolve the warning and CFI failure.

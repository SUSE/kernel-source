Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Do not report error code when synthesizing VM-Exit
 from Real Mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.11
Git-commit: 80962ec912db56d323883154efc2297473e692cb

commit 80962ec912db56d323883154efc2297473e692cb upstream.

Don't report an error code to L1 when synthesizing a nested VM-Exit and
L2 is in Real Mode.  Per Intel's SDM, regarding the error code valid bit:

  This bit is always 0 if the VM exit occurred while the logical processor
  was in real-address mode (CR0.PE=0).

The bug was introduced by a recent fix for AMD's Paged Real Mode, which
moved the error code suppression from the common "queue exception" path
to the "inject exception" path, but missed VMX's "synthesize VM-Exit"
path.

Fixes: b97f07458373 ("KVM: x86: determine if an exception has an error code only when injecting it.")

[ Upstream commit 5a597a19a2148d1c5cd987907a60c042ab0f62d5 ]

After previous changes, the description of the teo governor in the
documentation comment does not match the code any more, so update it
as appropriate.

Fixes: 449914398083 ("cpuidle: teo: Remove recent intercepts metric")
Fixes: 2662342079f5 ("cpuidle: teo: Gather statistics regarding whether or not to stop the tick")
Fixes: 6da8f9ba5a87 ("cpuidle: teo: Skip tick_nohz_get_sleep_length() call in some cases")

  * DOC: teo-description

  * The idea of this governor is based on the observation that on many systems
- * timer events are two or more orders of magnitude more frequent than any
- * other interrupts, so they are likely to be the most significant cause of CPU
- * wakeups from idle states.  Moreover, information about what happened in the
- * (relatively recent) past can be used to estimate whether or not the deepest
- * idle state with target residency within the (known) time till the closest
- * timer event, referred to as the sleep length, is likely to be suitable for
- * the upcoming CPU idle period and, if not, then which of the shallower idle
- * states to choose instead of it.
+ * timer interrupts are two or more orders of magnitude more frequent than any
+ * other interrupt types, so they are likely to dominate CPU wakeup patterns.
+ * Moreover, in principle, the time when the next timer event is going to occur
+ * can be determined at the idle state selection time, although doing that may
+ * be costly, so it can be regarded as the most reliable source of information
+ * for idle state selection.
  *
- * Of course, non-timer wakeup sources are more important in some use cases
- * which can be covered by taking a few most recent idle time intervals of the
- * CPU into account.  However, even in that context it is not necessary to
- * consider idle duration values greater than the sleep length, because the
- * closest timer will ultimately wake up the CPU anyway unless it is woken up
- * earlier.
+ * Of course, non-timer wakeup sources are more important in some use cases,
+ * but even then it is generally unnecessary to consider idle duration values
+ * greater than the time time till the next timer event, referred as the sleep
+ * length in what follows, because the closest timer will ultimately wake up the
+ * CPU anyway unless it is woken up earlier.
  *
- * Thus this governor estimates whether or not the prospective idle duration of
- * a CPU is likely to be significantly shorter than the sleep length and selects
- * an idle state for it accordingly.
+ * However, since obtaining the sleep length may be costly, the governor first
+ * checks if it can select a shallow idle state using wakeup pattern information
+ * from recent times, in which case it can do without knowing the sleep length
+ * at all.  For this purpose, it counts CPU wakeup events and looks for an idle
+ * state whose target residency has not exceeded the idle duration (measured
+ * after wakeup) in the majority of relevant recent cases.  If the target
+ * residency of that state is small enough, it may be used right away and the
+ * sleep length need not be determined.

  * The computations carried out by this governor are based on using bins whose

  * In order to select an idle state for a CPU, the governor takes the following

- *      had been equal to the current one).
+ *    - The sum of the "hits" metric for all of the idle states shallower than

  *      former and excluding the latter).
  *
- *    - If each of these sums that needs to be taken into account (because the
- *      check related to it has indicated that the CPU is likely to wake up

+ *    candidate state needs to be found, so look for it.

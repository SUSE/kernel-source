Subject: [PATCH] nvme: requeue namespace scan on missed AENs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.5
Git-commit: 9546ad1a9bda7362492114f5866b95b0ac4a100e

[ Upstream commit 9546ad1a9bda7362492114f5866b95b0ac4a100e ]

Scanning for namespaces can take some time, so if the target is
reconfigured while the scan is running we may miss a Attached Namespace
Attribute Changed AEN.

Check if the NVME_AER_NOTICE_NS_CHANGED bit is set once the scan has
finished, and requeue scanning to pick up any missed change.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: fix sound card reset line polarity
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 76d21ffc5d425bf7ea9888652c49d7dbda15f356

[ Upstream commit 76d21ffc5d425bf7ea9888652c49d7dbda15f356 ]

When resetting the block, the reset line is being driven low and then
high, which means that the line in DTS should be annotated as "active
low". It will become important when wcd9335 driver will be converted
to gpiod API that respects declared line polarities.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: fix usb_2 wakeup interrupt types
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: 24f8aba9a7c77c7e9d814a5754798e8346c7dd28

[ Upstream commit 24f8aba9a7c77c7e9d814a5754798e8346c7dd28 ]

The DP/DM wakeup interrupts are edge triggered and which edge to trigger
on depends on use-case and whether a Low speed or Full/High speed device
is connected.

Note that only triggering on rising edges can be used to detect resume
events but not disconnect events.

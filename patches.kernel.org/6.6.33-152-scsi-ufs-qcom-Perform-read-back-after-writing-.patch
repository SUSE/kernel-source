Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ufs: qcom: Perform read back after writing unipro mode
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.33
Git-commit: 823150ecf04f958213cf3bf162187cd1a91c885c

[ Upstream commit 823150ecf04f958213cf3bf162187cd1a91c885c ]

Currently, the QUNIPRO_SEL bit is written to and then an mb() is used to
ensure that completes before continuing.

mb() ensures that the write completes, but completion doesn't mean that it
isn't stored in a buffer somewhere. The recommendation for ensuring this
bit has taken effect on the device is to perform a read back to force it to
make it all the way to the device. This is documented in device-io.rst and
a talk by Will Deacon on this can be seen over here:

But, there's really no reason to even ensure completion before
continuing. The only requirement here is that this write is ordered to this
endpoint (which readl()/writel() guarantees already). For that reason the
mb() can be dropped altogether without anything forcing completion.

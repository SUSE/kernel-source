Subject: [PATCH] coresight: Fix loss of connection info when a module is
 unloaded
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: c45b2835e7b205783bdfe08cc98fa86a7c5eeb74

[ Upstream commit c45b2835e7b205783bdfe08cc98fa86a7c5eeb74 ]

child_fwnode should be a read only property based on the DT or ACPI. If
it's cleared on the parent device when a child is unloaded, then when
the child is loaded again the connection won't be remade.

child_dev should be cleared instead which signifies that the connection
should be remade when the child_fwnode registers a new coresight_device.

Similarly the reference count shouldn't be decremented as long as the
parent device exists. The correct place to drop the reference is in
coresight_release_platform_data() which is already done.

Reproducible on Juno with the following steps:

  # load all coresight modules.
  $ cd /sys/bus/coresight/devices/
  $ echo 1 > tmc_etr0/enable_sink
  $ echo 1 > etm0/enable_source
  # Works fine ^

  $ echo 0 > etm0/enable_source
  $ rmmod coresight-funnel
  $ modprobe coresight-funnel
  $ echo 1 > etm0/enable_source
  -bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

Fixes: 37ea1ffddffa ("coresight: Use fwnode handle instead of device names")
Fixes: 2af89ebacf29 ("coresight: Clear the connection field properly")

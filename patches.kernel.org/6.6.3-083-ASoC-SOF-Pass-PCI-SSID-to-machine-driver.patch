Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: Pass PCI SSID to machine driver
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.3
Git-commit: ba2de401d32625fe538d3f2c00ca73740dd2d516

[ Upstream commit ba2de401d32625fe538d3f2c00ca73740dd2d516 ]

Pass the PCI SSID of the audio interface through to the machine driver.
This allows the machine driver to use the SSID to uniquely identify the
specific hardware configuration and apply any platform-specific
configuration.

struct snd_sof_pdata is passed around inside the SOF code, but it then
passes configuration information to the machine driver through
struct snd_soc_acpi_mach and struct snd_soc_acpi_mach_params. So SSID
information has been added to both snd_sof_pdata and
snd_soc_acpi_mach_params.

PCI does not define 0x0000 as an invalid value so we can't use zero to
indicate that the struct member was not written. Instead a flag is
included to indicate that a value has been written to the
subsystem_vendor and subsystem_device members.

sof_pci_probe() creates the struct snd_sof_pdata. It is passed a struct
pci_dev so it can fill in the SSID value.

sof_machine_check() finds the appropriate struct snd_soc_acpi_mach. It
copies the SSID information across to the struct snd_soc_acpi_mach_params.
This done before calling any custom set_mach_params() so that it could be
used by the set_mach_params() callback to apply variant params.

The machine driver receives the struct snd_soc_acpi_mach as its
platform_data.

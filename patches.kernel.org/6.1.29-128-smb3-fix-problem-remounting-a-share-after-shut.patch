Subject: [PATCH] smb3: fix problem remounting a share after shutdown
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 716a3cf317456fa01d54398bb14ab354f50ed6a2

commit 716a3cf317456fa01d54398bb14ab354f50ed6a2 upstream.

xfstests generic/392 showed a problem where even after a
shutdown call was made on a mount, we would still attempt
to use the (now inaccessible) superblock if another mount
was attempted for the same share.

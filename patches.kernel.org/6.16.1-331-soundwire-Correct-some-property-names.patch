Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: Correct some property names
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: ae6a0f5b8a5b0ca2e4bf1c0380267ad83aca8401

[ Upstream commit ae6a0f5b8a5b0ca2e4bf1c0380267ad83aca8401 ]

The DisCo properties should be mipi-sdw-paging-supported and
mipi-sdw-bank-delay-supported, with an 'ed' on the end. Correct the
property names used in sdw_slave_read_prop().

The internal flag bank_delay_support is currently unimplemented, so that
being read wrong does not currently affect anything. The two existing
users for this helper and the paging_support flag rt1320-sdw.c and
rt721-sdca-sdw.c both manually set the flag in their slave properties,
thus are not affected by this bug either.

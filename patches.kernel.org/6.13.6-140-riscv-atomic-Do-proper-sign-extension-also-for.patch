Subject: [PATCH] riscv/atomic: Do proper sign extension also for unsigned in
 arch_cmpxchg
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.6
Git-commit: 1898300abf3508bca152e65b36cce5bf93d7e63e

commit 1898300abf3508bca152e65b36cce5bf93d7e63e upstream.

Sign extend also an unsigned compare value to match what lr.w is doing.
Otherwise try_cmpxchg may spuriously return true when used on a u32 value
that has the sign bit set, as it happens often in inode_set_ctime_current.

Do this in three conversion steps.  The first conversion to long is needed
to avoid a -Wpointer-to-int-cast warning when arch_cmpxchg is used with a
pointer type.  Then convert to int and back to long to always sign extend
the 32-bit value to 64-bit.

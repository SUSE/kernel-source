Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm: nl: announce deny-join-id0 flag
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.49
Git-commit: 2293c57484ae64c9a3c847c8807db8c26a3a4d41

commit 2293c57484ae64c9a3c847c8807db8c26a3a4d41 upstream.

During the connection establishment, a peer can tell the other one that
it cannot establish new subflows to the initial IP address and port by
setting the 'C' flag [1]. Doing so makes sense when the sender is behind
a strict NAT, operating behind a legacy Layer 4 load balancer, or using
anycast IP address for example.

When this 'C' flag is set, the path-managers must then not try to
establish new subflows to the other peer's initial IP address and port.
The in-kernel PM has access to this info, but the userspace PM didn't.

The RFC8684 [1] is strict about that:

  (...) therefore the receiver MUST NOT try to open any additional
  subflows toward this address and port.

So it is important to tell the userspace about that as it is responsible
for the respect of this flag.

When a new connection is created and established, the Netlink events
now contain the existing but not currently used 'flags' attribute. When
MPTCP_PM_EV_FLAG_DENY_JOIN_ID0 is set, it means no other subflows
to the initial IP address and port -- info that are also part of the
event -- can be established.

[ Conflicts in mptcp_pm.yaml, because the indentation has been modified
  in commit ec362192aa9e ("netlink: specs: fix up indentation errors"),
  which is not in this version. Applying the same modifications, but at
  a different level. ]

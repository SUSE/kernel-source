Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: test both signal & subflow
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.46
Git-commit: 4d2868b5d191c74262f7407972d68d1bf3245d6a

commit 4d2868b5d191c74262f7407972d68d1bf3245d6a upstream.

It should be quite uncommon to set both the subflow and the signal
flags: the initiator of the connection is typically the one creating new
subflows, not the other peer, then no need to announce additional local
addresses, and use it to create subflows.

But some people might be confused about the flags, and set both "just to
be sure at least the right one is set". To verify the previous fix, and
avoid future regressions, this specific case is now validated: the
client announces a new address, and initiates a new subflow from the
same address.

While working on this, another bug has been noticed, where the client
reset the new subflow because an ADD_ADDR echo got received as the 3rd
ACK: this new test also explicitly checks that no RST have been sent by
the client and server.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.

Subject: [PATCH] libbpf: Add missing per-arch include path

[ Upstream commit 710fbca820c721cdd60fa8c5bbe9deb4c0788aae ]

libbpf does not include the per-arch tools include path, e.g.
tools/arch/riscv/include. Some architectures depend those files to
build properly.

Include tools/arch/$(SUBARCH)/include in the libbpf build.

Fixes: 6d74d178fe6e ("tools: Add riscv barrier implementation")

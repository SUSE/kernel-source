Subject: [PATCH] char: misc: register chrdev region with all possible minors
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.5
Git-commit: c876be906ce7e518d9ef9926478669c151999e69

commit c876be906ce7e518d9ef9926478669c151999e69 upstream.

register_chrdev will only register the first 256 minors of a major chrdev.
That means that dynamically allocated misc devices with minor above 255
will fail to open with -ENXIO.

This was found by kernel test robot when testing a different change that
makes all dynamically allocated minors be above 255. This has, however,
been separately tested by creating 256 serio_raw devices with the help of
userio driver.

Ever since allowing misc devices with minors above 128, this has been
possible.

Fix it by registering all minor numbers from 0 to MINORMASK + 1 for
MISC_MAJOR.

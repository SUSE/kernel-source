Subject: [PATCH] iommu/iova: Improve 32-bit free space estimate
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: 5b61343b50590fb04a3f6be2cdc4868091757262

commit 5b61343b50590fb04a3f6be2cdc4868091757262 upstream.

For various reasons based on the allocator behaviour and typical
use-cases at the time, when the max32_alloc_size optimisation was
introduced it seemed reasonable to couple the reset of the tracked
size to the update of cached32_node upon freeing a relevant IOVA.
However, since subsequent optimisations focused on helping genuine
32-bit devices make best use of even more limited address spaces, it
is now a lot more likely for cached32_node to be anywhere in a "full"
32-bit address space, and as such more likely for space to become
available from IOVAs below that node being freed.

At this point, the short-cut in __cached_rbnode_delete_update() really
doesn't hold up any more, and we need to fix the logic to reliably
provide the expected behaviour. We still want cached32_node to only move
upwards, but we should reset the allocation size if *any* 32-bit space
has become available.

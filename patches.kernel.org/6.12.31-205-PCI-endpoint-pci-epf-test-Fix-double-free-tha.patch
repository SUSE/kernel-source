Subject: [PATCH] PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Fix double free that causes
 kernel to oops

[ Upstream commit 934e9d137d937706004c325fa1474f9e3f1ba10a ]

Fix a kernel oops found while testing the stm32_pcie Endpoint driver
with handling of PERST# deassertion:

During EP initialization, pci_epf_test_alloc_space() allocates all BARs,
which are further freed if epc_set_bar() fails (for instance, due to no
free inbound window).

However, when pci_epc_set_bar() fails, the error path:

  pci_epc_set_bar() ->
    pci_epf_free_space()

does not clear the previous assignment to epf_test->reg[bar].

Then, if the host reboots, the PERST# deassertion restarts the BAR
allocation sequence with the same allocation failure (no free inbound
window), creating a double free situation since epf_test->reg[bar] was
deallocated and is still non-NULL.

Thus, make sure that pci_epf_alloc_space() and pci_epf_free_space()
invocations are symmetric, and as such, set epf_test->reg[bar] to NULL
when memory is freed.

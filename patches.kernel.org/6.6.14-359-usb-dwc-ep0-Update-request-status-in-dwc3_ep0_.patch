Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc: ep0: Update request status in
 dwc3_ep0_stall_restart
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.14
Git-commit: e9d40b215e38480fd94c66b06d79045717a59e9c

commit e9d40b215e38480fd94c66b06d79045717a59e9c upstream.

Current implementation blocks the running operations when Plug-out and
Plug-In is performed continuously, process gets stuck in
dwc3_thread_interrupt().

Code Flow:

	CPU1

	->Gadget_start
	->dwc3_interrupt
	->dwc3_thread_interrupt
	->dwc3_process_event_buf
	->dwc3_process_event_entry
	->dwc3_endpoint_interrupt
	->dwc3_ep0_interrupt
	->dwc3_ep0_inspect_setup
	->dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart

By this time if pending_list is not empty, it will get the next request
on the given list and calls dwc3_gadget_giveback which will unmap request
and call its complete() callback to notify upper layers that it has
completed. Currently dwc3_gadget_giveback status is set to -ECONNRESET,
whereas it should be -ESHUTDOWN based on condition if not dwc->connected
is true.

Subject: [PATCH] net/neighbor: clear error in case strict check is not set
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.66
Git-commit: 0de6a472c3b38432b2f184bd64eb70d9ea36d107

[ Upstream commit 0de6a472c3b38432b2f184bd64eb70d9ea36d107 ]

Commit 51183d233b5a ("net/neighbor: Update neigh_dump_info for strict
data checking") added strict checking. The err variable is not cleared,
so if we find no table to dump we will return the validation error even
if user did not want strict checking.

I think the only way to hit this is to send an buggy request, and ask
for a table which doesn't exist, so there's no point treating this
as a real fix. I only noticed it because a syzbot repro depended on it
to trigger another bug.

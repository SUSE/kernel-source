Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: gdsc: Bump parent usage count when GDSC is found
 enabled
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 41fff779d7948147f2440c4bb134cdf8b45b22d7

[ Upstream commit 41fff779d7948147f2440c4bb134cdf8b45b22d7 ]

When a GDSC is found to be enabled at boot the pm_runtime state will
be unbalanced as the GDSC is later turned off. Fix this by increasing
the usage counter on the power-domain, in line with how we handled the
regulator state.

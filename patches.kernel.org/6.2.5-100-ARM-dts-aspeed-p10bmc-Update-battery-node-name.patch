Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed: p10bmc: Update battery node name
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.5
Git-commit: a8cef541dd5ef9445130660008c029205c4c5aa5

[ Upstream commit a8cef541dd5ef9445130660008c029205c4c5aa5 ]

The ADC sensor for the battery needs to be named "iio-hwmon" for
compatibility with user space applications.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: hp-wmi: Resolve WMI query failures on some
 devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.4
Git-commit: dc6a6ab58379f25bf991d8e4a13b001ed806e881

[ Upstream commit dc6a6ab58379f25bf991d8e4a13b001ed806e881 ]

WMI queries fail on some devices where the ACPI method HWMC
unconditionally attempts to create Fields beyond the buffer
if the buffer is too small, this breaks essential features
such as power profiles:

         CreateByteField (Arg1, 0x10, D008)
         CreateByteField (Arg1, 0x11, D009)
         CreateByteField (Arg1, 0x12, D010)
         CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x10, D032)
         CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, 0x0400, D128)

In cases where args->data had zero length, ACPI BIOS Error
(bug): AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT, Field [D008] at bit
offset/length 128/8 exceeds size of target Buffer (128 bits)
(20211217/dsopcode-198) was obtained.

ACPI BIOS Error (bug): AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT, Field [D009] at bit
offset/length 136/8 exceeds size of target Buffer (136bits)
(20211217/dsopcode-198)

The original code created a buffer size of 128 bytes regardless if
the WMI call required a smaller buffer or not.  This particular
behavior occurs in older BIOS and reproduced in OMEN laptops.  Newer
BIOS handles buffer sizes properly and meets the latest specification
requirements.  This is the reason why testing with a dynamically
allocated buffer did not uncover any failures with the test systems at
hand.

This patch was tested on several OMEN, Elite, and Zbooks.  It was
confirmed the patch resolves HPWMI_FAN GET/SET calls in an OMEN
Laptop 15-ek0xxx.  No problems were reported when testing on several Elite
and Zbooks notebooks.

Subject: [PATCH] can: m_can: m_can_close(): don't call free_irq() for IRQ-less
 devices
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.61
Git-commit: e4de81f9e134c78ff7c75a00e43bd819643530d0

commit e4de81f9e134c78ff7c75a00e43bd819643530d0 upstream.

In commit b382380c0d2d ("can: m_can: Add hrtimer to generate software
interrupt") support for IRQ-less devices was added. Instead of an
interrupt, the interrupt routine is called by a hrtimer-based polling
loop.

That patch forgot to change free_irq() to be only called for devices
with IRQs. Fix this, by calling free_irq() conditionally only if an
IRQ is available for the device (and thus has been requested
previously).

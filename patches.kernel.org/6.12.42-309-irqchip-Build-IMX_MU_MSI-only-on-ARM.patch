Subject: [PATCH] irqchip: Build IMX_MU_MSI only on ARM
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.42
Git-commit: 3b6a18f0da8720d612d8a682ea5c55870da068e0

[ Upstream commit 3b6a18f0da8720d612d8a682ea5c55870da068e0 ]

Compile-testing IMX_MU_MSI on x86 without PCI_MSI support results in a
build failure:

drivers/gpio/gpio-sprd.c:8:
include/linux/gpio/driver.h:41:33: error: field 'msiinfo' has incomplete type
drivers/iommu/iommufd/viommu.c:4:
include/linux/msi.h:528:33: error: field 'alloc_info' has incomplete type

Tighten the dependency further to only allow compile testing on Arm.
This could be refined further to allow certain x86 configs.

This was submitted before to address a different build failure, which was
fixed differently, but the problem has now returned in a different form.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: Fix returned array size name for
 atomic_get_input_bus_fmts kdoc
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.21
Git-commit: 0d3c9333d976af41d7dbc6bf4d9d2e95fbdf9c89

[ Upstream commit 0d3c9333d976af41d7dbc6bf4d9d2e95fbdf9c89 ]

The returned array size for input formats is set through
atomic_get_input_bus_fmts()'s 'num_input_fmts' argument, so use
'num_input_fmts' to represent the array size in the function's kdoc,
not 'num_output_fmts'.

Fixes: 91ea83306bfa ("drm/bridge: Fix the bridge kernel doc")
Fixes: f32df58acc68 ("drm/bridge: Add the necessary bits to support bus format negotiation")

Subject: [PATCH] ata: libata-sata: increase PMP SRST timeout to 10s
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.56
Git-commit: 753a4d531bc518633ea88ac0ed02b25a16823d51

commit 753a4d531bc518633ea88ac0ed02b25a16823d51 upstream.

On certain SATA controllers, softreset fails after wakeup from S2RAM with
the message "softreset failed (1st FIS failed)", sometimes resulting in
drives not being detected again. With the increased timeout, this issue
is avoided. Instead, "softreset failed (device not ready)" is now
logged 1-2 times; this later failure seems to cause fewer problems
however, and the drives are detected reliably once they've spun up and
the probe is retried.

The issue was observed with the primary SATA controller of the QNAP
TS-453B, which is an "Intel Corporation Celeron/Pentium Silver Processor
SATA Controller [8086:31e3] (rev 06)" integrated in the Celeron J4125 CPU,
and the following drives:

- Seagate IronWolf ST12000VN0008
- Seagate IronWolf ST8000NE0004

The SATA controller seems to be more relevant to this issue than the
drives, as the same drives are always detected reliably on the secondary
SATA controller on the same board (an ASMedia 106x) without any "softreset
failed" errors even without the increased timeout.

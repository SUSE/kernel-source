commit e339c6d628fe66c9b64bf31040a55770952aec57 upstream.

If we can't find a free fence register to handle a fault in the GMADR
range just return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE without populating the PTE so that
userspace will retry the access and trigger another fault. Eventually
we should find a free fence and the fault will get properly handled.

A further improvement idea might be to reserve a fence (or one per CPU?)
for the express purpose of handling faults without having to retry. But
that would require some additional work.

Looks like this may have gotten broken originally by
commit 39965b376601 ("drm/i915: don't trash the gtt when running out of fences")
as that changed the errno to -EDEADLK which wasn't handle by the gtt
fault code either. But later in commit 2feeb52859fc ("drm/i915/gt: Fix
-EDEADLK handling regression") I changed it again to -ENOBUFS as -EDEADLK
was now getting used for the ww mutex dance. So this fix only makes
sense after that last commit.

Subject: [PATCH] nvme-tcp: stop auth work after tearing down queues in error
 recovery
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.13
Git-commit: 1f1a4f89562d3b33b6ca4fc8a4f3bd4cd35ab4ea

[ Upstream commit 1f1a4f89562d3b33b6ca4fc8a4f3bd4cd35ab4ea ]

when starting error recovery there might be a authentication work
running, and it involves I/O commands. Given the controller is tearing
down there is no chance for the I/O to complete other than timing out
which may unnecessarily take a full io timeout.

So first tear down the queues, fail/cancel all inflight I/O (including
potentially authentication) and only then stop authentication. This
ensures that failover is not stalled due to blocked authentication I/O.

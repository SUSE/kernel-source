Subject: [PATCH] of: address: Preserve the flags portion on 1:1 dma-ranges
 mapping
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.7
Git-commit: 7f05e20b989ac33c9c0f8c2028ec0a566493548f

commit 7f05e20b989ac33c9c0f8c2028ec0a566493548f upstream.

A missing or empty dma-ranges in a DT node implies a 1:1 mapping for dma
translations. In this specific case, the current behaviour is to zero out
the entire specifier so that the translation could be carried on as an
offset from zero. This includes address specifier that has flags (e.g.
PCI ranges).

Once the flags portion has been zeroed, the translation chain is broken
since the mapping functions will check the upcoming address specifier
against mismatching flags, always failing the 1:1 mapping and its entire
purpose of always succeeding.

Set to zero only the address portion while passing the flags through.

Subject: [PATCH] nfc: st-nci: Add SPI ID matching DT compatible
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.9
Git-commit: 31339440b2d0a4987030aac026adbaba44e22490

[ Upstream commit 31339440b2d0a4987030aac026adbaba44e22490 ]

Currently autoloading for SPI devices does not use the DT ID table, it uses
SPI modalises. Supporting OF modalises is going to be difficult if not
impractical, an attempt was made but has been reverted, so ensure that
module autoloading works for this driver by adding the part name used in
the compatible to the list of SPI IDs.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp: correct ref clock for ufs_mem_phy
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: f3aa975e230e060c07dcfdf3fe92b59809422c13

[ Upstream commit f3aa975e230e060c07dcfdf3fe92b59809422c13 ]

The first UFS host controller fails to start on the SA8540P automotive
board (QDrive3) due to the following errors:

    ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufs: ufshcd_query_flag: Sending flag query for idn 18 failed, err = 253
    ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufs: ufshcd_query_flag: Sending flag query for idn 18 failed, err = 253
    ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufs: ufshcd_query_flag: Sending flag query for idn 18 failed, err = 253
    ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufs: ufshcd_query_flag_retry: query attribute, opcode 5, idn 18, failed
        with error 253 after 3 retries

The system eventually fails to boot with the warning:

    gcc_ufs_phy_axi_clk status stuck at 'off'

This issue can be worked around by adding clk_ignore_unused to the
kernel command line since the system firmware sets up this clock for us.

Let's fix this issue by updating the ref clock on ufs_mem_phy. Note
that the downstream MSM 5.4 sources list this as ref_clk_parent. With
this patch, the SA8540P is able to be booted without clk_ignore_unused.

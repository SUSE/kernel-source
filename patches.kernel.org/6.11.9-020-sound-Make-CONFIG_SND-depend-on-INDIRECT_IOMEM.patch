Subject: [PATCH] sound: Make CONFIG_SND depend on INDIRECT_IOMEM instead of
 UML
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.9
Git-commit: ad6639f143a0b42d7fb110ad14f5949f7c218890

[ Upstream commit ad6639f143a0b42d7fb110ad14f5949f7c218890 ]

When building for the UM arch and neither INDIRECT_IOMEM=y, nor
HAS_IOMEM=y is selected, it will fall back to the implementations from
asm-generic/io.h for IO memcpy. But these fall-back functions just do a
memcpy. So, instead of depending on UML, add dependency on 'HAS_IOMEM ||
INDIRECT_IOMEM'.

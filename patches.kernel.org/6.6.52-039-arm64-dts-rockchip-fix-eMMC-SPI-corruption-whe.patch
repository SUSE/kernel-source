Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix eMMC/SPI corruption when audio has
 been used on RK3399 Puma
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.52
Git-commit: bb94a157b37ec23f53906a279320f6ed64300eba

commit bb94a157b37ec23f53906a279320f6ed64300eba upstream.

In commit 91419ae0420f ("arm64: dts: rockchip: use BCLK to GPIO switch
on rk3399"), an additional pinctrl state was added whose default pinmux
is for 8ch i2s0. However, Puma only has 2ch i2s0. It's been overriding
the pinctrl-0 property but the second property override was missed in
the aforementioned commit.

On Puma, a hardware slider called "BIOS Disable/Normal Boot" can disable
eMMC and SPI to force booting from SD card. Another software-controlled
GPIO is then configured to override this behavior to make eMMC and SPI
available without human intervention. This is currently done in U-Boot
and it was enough until the aforementioned commit.

Indeed, because of this additional not-yet-overridden property, this
software-controlled GPIO is now muxed in a state that does not override
this hardware slider anymore, rendering SPI and eMMC flashes unusable.

Let's override the property with the 2ch pinmux to fix this.

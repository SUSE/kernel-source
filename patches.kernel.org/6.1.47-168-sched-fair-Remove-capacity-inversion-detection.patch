Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Remove capacity inversion detection
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.47
Git-commit: a2e90611b9f425adbbfcdaa5b5e49958ddf6f61b

commit a2e90611b9f425adbbfcdaa5b5e49958ddf6f61b upstream.

Remove the capacity inversion detection which is now handled by
util_fits_cpu() returning -1 when we need to continue to look for a
potential CPU with better performance.

This ends up almost reverting patches below except for some comments:
commit da07d2f9c153 ("sched/fair: Fixes for capacity inversion detection")
commit aa69c36f31aa ("sched/fair: Consider capacity inversion in util_fits_cpu()")
commit 44c7b80bffc3 ("sched/fair: Detect capacity inversion")

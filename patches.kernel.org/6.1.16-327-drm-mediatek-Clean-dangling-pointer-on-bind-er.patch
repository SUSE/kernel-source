Subject: [PATCH] drm/mediatek: Clean dangling pointer on bind error path

[ Upstream commit 36aa8c61af55675ed967900fbe5deb32d776f051 ]

mtk_drm_bind() can fail, in which case drm_dev_put() is called,
destroying the drm_device object. However a pointer to it was still
being held in the private object, and that pointer would be passed along
to DRM in mtk_drm_sys_prepare() if a suspend were triggered at that
point, resulting in a panic. Clean the pointer when destroying the
object in the error path to prevent this from happening.

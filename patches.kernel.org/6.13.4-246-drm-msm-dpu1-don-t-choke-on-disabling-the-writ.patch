Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dpu1: don't choke on disabling the writeback
 connector

commit d9f55e2abfb933818c772eba659a9b7ab28a44d0 upstream.

During suspend/resume process all connectors are explicitly disabled and
then reenabled. However resume fails because of the connector_status check:

[dpu error]connector not connected 3
[drm:drm_mode_config_helper_resume [drm_kms_helper]] *ERROR* Failed to resume (-22)

It doesn't make sense to check for the Writeback connected status (and
other drivers don't perform such check), so drop the check.

It wasn't a problem before the commit 71174f362d67 ("drm/msm/dpu: move
writeback's atomic_check to dpu_writeback.c"), since encoder's
atomic_check() is called under a different conditions that the
connector's atomic_check() (e.g. it is not called if there is no
connected CRTC or if the corresponding connector is not a part of the
new state).

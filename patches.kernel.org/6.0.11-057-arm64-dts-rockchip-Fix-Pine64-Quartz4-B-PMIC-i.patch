Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix Pine64 Quartz4-B PMIC interrupt
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.11
Git-commit: 562105c1b072411c71ac2202410d83ee79297624

[ Upstream commit 562105c1b072411c71ac2202410d83ee79297624 ]

Ths PMIC's interrupt line is tied to GPIO0_A3. This is described
correctly for the pinmux setting, but incorrectly for the interrupt.

Correct the interrupt setting so that interrupts from the PMIC get
delivered.

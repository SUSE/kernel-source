Subject: [PATCH] m68k: mcfgpio: Fix incorrect register offset for
 CONFIG_M5441x
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.64
Git-commit: f212140962c93cd5da43283a18e31681540fc23d

[ Upstream commit f212140962c93cd5da43283a18e31681540fc23d ]

Fix a typo in the CONFIG_M5441x preprocessor condition, where the GPIO
register offset was incorrectly set to 8 instead of 0. This prevented
proper GPIO configuration for m5441x targets.

Fixes: bea8bcb12da0 ("m68knommu: Add support for the Coldfire m5441x.")

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dt-bindings: mt6359: Update generic node name and
 dmic-mode
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.64
Git-commit: 4649cbd97fdae5069e9a71cd7669b62b90e03669

[ Upstream commit 4649cbd97fdae5069e9a71cd7669b62b90e03669 ]

Some fix and updates in the following items:
1. examples:
   Update generic node name to 'audio-codec' to comply with the
   coming change in 'mt6359.dtsi'. This change is necessary to fix the
   dtbs_check error:
   pmic: 'mt6359codec' does not match any of the regexes: 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'

2. mediatek,dmic-mode:
   After inspecting the .dts and .dtsi files using 'mt6359-codec', it was
   discovered that the definitions of 'two wires' and 'one wire' are
   inverted compared to the DT schema.
   For example, the following boards using MT6359 PMIC:
    - mt8192-asurada.dtsi
    - mt8195-cherry.dtsi
   These boards use the same definitions of 'dmic-mode' as other boards
   using MT6358 PMIC. The meaning of '0' or '1' has been noted as comments
   in the device trees.

   Upon examining the code in [1] and [2], it was confirmed that the
   definitions of 'dmic-mode' are consistent between "MT6359 PMIC" and
   "MT6358 PMIC". Therefore, the DT Schema should be correct as is.

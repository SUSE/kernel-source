Subject: [PATCH] perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix sampling using single range output
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: ce0d998be9274dd3a3d971cbeaa6fe28fd2c3062

commit ce0d998be9274dd3a3d971cbeaa6fe28fd2c3062 upstream.

Deal with errata TGL052, ADL037 and RPL017 "Trace May Contain Incorrect
Data When Configured With Single Range Output Larger Than 4KB" by
disabling single range output whenever larger than 4KB.

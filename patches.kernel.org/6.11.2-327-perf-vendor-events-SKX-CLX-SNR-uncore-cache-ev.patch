Subject: [PATCH] perf vendor events: SKX, CLX, SNR uncore cache event fixes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.2
Git-commit: 7a75c6c23a2ea8dd22d90805b3a42bd65c53830e

[ Upstream commit 7a75c6c23a2ea8dd22d90805b3a42bd65c53830e ]

Cache home agent (CHA) events were setting the low rather than high
config1 bits. SNR was using CLX CHA events, however its CHA is similar
to ICX so remove the events.

Incorporate the updates in:

  https://github.com/intel/perfmon/pull/215
  https://github.com/intel/perfmon/pull/216

Fixes: 4cc49942444e958b ("perf vendor events: Update cascadelakex events/metrics")
Closes: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-perf-users/CAPhsuW4nem9XZP+b=sJJ7kqXG-cafz0djZf51HsgjCiwkGBA+A@mail.gmail.com/

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: pinctrl: mt8192: Use generic bias instead of
 pull-*-adv
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: 353d2ef77f2be4c1b9b3c70f1637a9986f07b997

commit 353d2ef77f2be4c1b9b3c70f1637a9986f07b997 upstream.

Commit cafe19db7751 ("pinctrl: mediatek: Backward compatible to previous
Mediatek's bias-pull usage") allowed the bias-pull-up and bias-pull-down
properties to be used for setting PUPD/R1/R0 type bias on mtk-paris
based SoC's, which was previously only supported by the custom
mediatek,pull-up-adv and mediatek,pull-down-adv properties.

Since the bias-pull-{up,down} properties already have defines associated
thus being more descriptive and is more universal on MediaTek platforms,
and given that there are no mediatek,pull-{up,down}-adv users on mt8192
yet, remove the custom adv properties in favor of the generic ones.

Note that only mediatek,pull-up-adv was merged in the binding, but not
its down counterpart.

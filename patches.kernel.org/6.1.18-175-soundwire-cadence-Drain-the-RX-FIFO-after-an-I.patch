Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: cadence: Drain the RX FIFO after an IO timeout
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.18
Git-commit: 0603a47bd3a8f439d7844b841eee1819353063e0

[ Upstream commit 0603a47bd3a8f439d7844b841eee1819353063e0 ]

If wait_for_completion_timeout() times-out in _cdns_xfer_msg() it
is possible that something could have been written to the RX FIFO.
In this case, we should drain the RX FIFO so that anything in it
doesn't carry over and mess up the next transfer.

Obviously, if we got to this state something went wrong, and we
don't really know the state of everything. The cleanup in this
situation cannot be bullet-proof but we should attempt to avoid
breaking future transaction, if only to reduce the amount of
error noise when debugging the failure from a kernel log.

Note that this patch only implements the draining for blocking
(non-deferred) transfers. The deferred API doesn't have any proper
handling of error conditions and would need some re-design before
implementing cleanup. That is a task for a separate patch...

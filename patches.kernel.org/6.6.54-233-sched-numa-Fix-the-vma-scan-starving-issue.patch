Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Fix the vma scan starving issue
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.54
Git-commit: f22cde4371f3c624e947a35b075c06c771442a43

[ Upstream commit f22cde4371f3c624e947a35b075c06c771442a43 ]

Problem statement:
Since commit fc137c0ddab2 ("sched/numa: enhance vma scanning logic"), the
Numa vma scan overhead has been reduced a lot.  Meanwhile, the reducing of
the vma scan might create less Numa page fault information.  The
insufficient information makes it harder for the Numa balancer to make
decision.  Later, commit b7a5b537c55c08 ("sched/numa: Complete scanning of
partial VMAs regardless of PID activity") and commit 84db47ca7146d7
("sched/numa: Fix mm numa_scan_seq based unconditional scan") are found to
bring back part of the performance.

Recently when running SPECcpu omnetpp_r on a 320 CPUs/2 Sockets system, a
long duration of remote Numa node read was observed by PMU events: A few
cores having ~500MB/s remote memory access for ~20 seconds.  It causes
high core-to-core variance and performance penalty.  After the
investigation, it is found that many vmas are skipped due to the active
PID check.  According to the trace events, in most cases,
vma_is_accessed() returns false because the history access info stored in
pids_active array has been cleared.

Proposal:
The main idea is to adjust vma_is_accessed() to let it return true easier.
Thus compare the diff between mm->numa_scan_seq and
vma->numab_state->prev_scan_seq.  If the diff has exceeded the threshold,
scan the vma.

This patch especially helps the cases where there are small number of
threads, like the process-based SPECcpu.  Without this patch, if the
SPECcpu process access the vma at the beginning, then sleeps for a long
time, the pid_active array will be cleared.  A a result, if this process
is woken up again, it never has a chance to set prot_none anymore.
Because only the first 2 times of access is granted for vma scan:
(current->mm->numa_scan_seq) - vma->numab_state->start_scan_seq) < 2 to be
worse, no other threads within the task can help set the prot_none.  This
causes information lost.

Raghavendra helped test current patch and got the positive result
on the AMD platform:

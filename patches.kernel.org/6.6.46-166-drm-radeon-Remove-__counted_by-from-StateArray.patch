Subject: [PATCH] drm/radeon: Remove __counted_by from StateArray.states[]
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.46
Git-commit: 2bac084468847cfe5bbc7166082b2a208514bb1c

commit 2bac084468847cfe5bbc7166082b2a208514bb1c upstream.

Work for __counted_by on generic pointers in structures (not just
flexible array members) has started landing in Clang 19 (current tip of
tree). During the development of this feature, a restriction was added
to __counted_by to prevent the flexible array member's element type from
including a flexible array member itself such as:

  struct foo {
    int count;
    char buf[];
  };

  struct bar {
    int count;
    struct foo data[] __counted_by(count);
  };

because the size of data cannot be calculated with the standard array
size formula:

  sizeof(struct foo) * count

This restriction was downgraded to a warning but due to CONFIG_WERROR,
it can still break the build. The application of __counted_by on the
states member of 'struct _StateArray' triggers this restriction,
resulting in:

  drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/pptable.h:442:5: error: 'counted_by' should not be applied to an array with element of unknown size because 'ATOM_PPLIB_STATE_V2' (aka 'struct _ATOM_PPLIB_STATE_V2') is a struct type with a flexible array member. This will be an error in a future compiler version [-Werror,-Wbounds-safety-counted-by-elt-type-unknown-size]
    442 |     ATOM_PPLIB_STATE_V2 states[] __counted_by(ucNumEntries);
        |     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 error generated.

Remove this use of __counted_by to fix the warning/error. However,
rather than remove it altogether, leave it commented, as it may be
possible to support this in future compiler releases.

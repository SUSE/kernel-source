Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280-idp: Configure CTS pin to
 bias-bus-hold for bluetooth
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 497b272759986af1aa5a25b5e903d082c67bd8f6

[ Upstream commit 497b272759986af1aa5a25b5e903d082c67bd8f6 ]

WLAN rail was leaking power during RBSC/sleep even after turning BT off.
Change active and sleep pinctrl configurations to handle same.

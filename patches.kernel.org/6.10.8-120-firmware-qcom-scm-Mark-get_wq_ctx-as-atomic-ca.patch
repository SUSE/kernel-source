Subject: [PATCH] firmware: qcom: scm: Mark get_wq_ctx() as atomic call
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.8
Git-commit: 9960085a3a82c58d3323c1c20b991db6045063b0

commit 9960085a3a82c58d3323c1c20b991db6045063b0 upstream.

Currently get_wq_ctx() is wrongly configured as a standard call. When two
SMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to
resume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is
interrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated
a waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.

To avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can't be a standard
SMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.

Subject: [PATCH] book3s64/radix : Align section vmemmap start address to
 PAGE_SIZE
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.6

[ Upstream commit 9cf7e13fecbab0894f6986fc6986ab2eba8de52e ]

A vmemmap altmap is a device-provided region used to provide
backing storage for struct pages. For each namespace, the altmap
should belong to that same namespace. If the namespaces are
created unaligned, there is a chance that the section vmemmap
start address could also be unaligned. If the section vmemmap
start address is unaligned, the altmap page allocated from the
current namespace might be used by the previous namespace also.
During the free operation, since the altmap is shared between two
namespaces, the previous namespace may detect that the page does
not belong to its altmap and incorrectly assume that the page is a
normal page. It then attempts to free the normal page, which leads
to a kernel crash.

Another issue is that if there is no altmap, a PMD-sized vmemmap
page will be allocated from RAM, regardless of the alignment of
the section start address. If the section start address is not
aligned to the PMD size, a VM_BUG_ON will be triggered when
setting the PMD-sized page to page table.

In this patch, we are aligning the section vmemmap start address
to PAGE_SIZE. After alignment, the start address will not be
part of the current namespace, and a normal page will be allocated
for the vmemmap mapping of the current section. For the remaining
sections, altmaps will be allocated. During the free operation,
the normal page will be correctly freed.

In the same way, a PMD_SIZE vmemmap page will be allocated only if
the section start address is PMD_SIZE-aligned; otherwise, it will
fall back to a PAGE-sized vmemmap allocation.

Without this patch
==================
NS1 start               NS2 start
 _________________________________________________________
|         NS1               |            NS2              |
 ---------------------------------------------------------
| Altmap| Altmap | .....|Altmap| Altmap | ...........
|  NS1  |  NS1   |      | NS2  |  NS2   |

In the above scenario, NS1 and NS2 are two namespaces. The vmemmap
for NS1 comes from Altmap NS1, which belongs to NS1, and the
vmemmap for NS2 comes from Altmap NS2, which belongs to NS2.

The vmemmap start for NS2 is not aligned, so Altmap NS2 is shared
by both NS1 and NS2. During the free operation in NS1, Altmap NS2
is not part of NS1's altmap, causing it to attempt to free an
invalid page.

With this patch
===============
NS1 start               NS2 start
 _________________________________________________________
|         NS1               |            NS2              |
 ---------------------------------------------------------
| Altmap| Altmap | .....| Normal | Altmap | Altmap |.......
|  NS1  |  NS1   |      |  Page  |  NS2   |  NS2   |

If the vmemmap start for NS2 is not aligned then we are allocating
a normal page. NS1 and NS2 vmemmap will be freed correctly.

Subject: [PATCH] protect the fetch of ->fd[fd] in do_dup2() from
 mispredictions
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.45
Git-commit: 8aa37bde1a7b645816cda8b80df4753ecf172bf1

commit 8aa37bde1a7b645816cda8b80df4753ecf172bf1 upstream.

both callers have verified that fd is not greater than ->max_fds;
however, misprediction might end up with
        tofree = fdt->fd[fd];
being speculatively executed.  That's wrong for the same reasons
why it's wrong in close_fd()/file_close_fd_locked(); the same
solution applies - array_index_nospec(fd, fdt->max_fds) could differ
from fd only in case of speculative execution on mispredicted path.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx8mp-beacon-kit: Fix audio_pll2 clock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: 161af16c18f3e10d81870328928e5fff3a7d47bb

[ Upstream commit 161af16c18f3e10d81870328928e5fff3a7d47bb ]

Commit 16c984524862 ("arm64: dts: imx8mp: don't initialize audio clocks
from CCM node") removed the Audio clocks from the main clock node, because
the intent is to force people to setup the audio PLL clocks per board
instead of having a common set of rates since not all boards may use
the various audio PLL clocks for audio devices.

This resulted in an incorrect clock rate when attempting to playback
audio, since the AUDIO_PLL2 wasn't set any longer. Fix this by
setting the AUDIO_PLL2 rate inside the SAI3 node since it's the SAI3
that needs it.

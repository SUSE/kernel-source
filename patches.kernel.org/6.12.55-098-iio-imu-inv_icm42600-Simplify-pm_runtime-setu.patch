Subject: [PATCH] iio: imu: inv_icm42600: Simplify pm_runtime setup
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.55
Git-commit: 0792c1984a45ccd7a296d6b8cb78088bc99a212e

[ Upstream commit 0792c1984a45ccd7a296d6b8cb78088bc99a212e ]

Rework the power management in inv_icm42600_core_probe() to use
devm_pm_runtime_set_active_enabled(), which simplifies the runtime PM
setup by handling activation and enabling in one step.
Remove the separate inv_icm42600_disable_pm callback, as it's no longer
needed with the devm-managed approach.
Using devm_pm_runtime_enable() also fixes the missing disable of
autosuspend.
Update inv_icm42600_disable_vddio_reg() to only disable the regulator if
the device is not suspended i.e. powered-down, preventing unbalanced
disables.
Also remove redundant error msg on regulator_disable(), the regulator
framework already emits an error message when regulator_disable() fails.

This simplifies the PM setup and avoids manipulating the usage counter
unnecessarily.

Subject: [PATCH] lsm: handle the NULL buffer case in lsm_fill_user_ctx()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: eaf0e7a3d2711018789e9fdb89191d19aa139c47

[ Upstream commit eaf0e7a3d2711018789e9fdb89191d19aa139c47 ]

Passing a NULL buffer into the lsm_get_self_attr() syscall is a valid
way to quickly determine the minimum size of the buffer needed to for
the syscall to return all of the LSM attributes to the caller.
Unfortunately we/I broke that behavior in commit d7cf3412a9f6
("lsm: consolidate buffer size handling into lsm_fill_user_ctx()")
such that it returned an error to the caller; this patch restores the
original desired behavior of using the NULL buffer as a quick way to
correctly size the attribute buffer.

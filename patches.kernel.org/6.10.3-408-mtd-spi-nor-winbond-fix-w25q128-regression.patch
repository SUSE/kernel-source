Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: winbond: fix w25q128 regression
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: d35df77707bf5ae1221b5ba1c8a88cf4fcdd4901

[ Upstream commit d35df77707bf5ae1221b5ba1c8a88cf4fcdd4901 ]

Commit 83e824a4a595 ("mtd: spi-nor: Correct flags for Winbond w25q128")
removed the flags for non-SFDP devices. It was assumed that it wasn't in
use anymore. This wasn't true. Add the no_sfdp_flags as well as the size
again.

We add the additional flags for dual and quad read because they have
been reported to work properly by Hartmut using both older and newer
versions of this flash, the similar flashes with 64Mbit and 256Mbit
already have these flags and because it will (luckily) trigger our
legacy SFDP parsing, so newer versions with SFDP support will still get
the parameters from the SFDP tables.

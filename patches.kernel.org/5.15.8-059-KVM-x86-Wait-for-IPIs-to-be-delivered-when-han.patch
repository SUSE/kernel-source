Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Wait for IPIs to be delivered when handling Hyper-V
 TLB flush hypercall
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.8
Git-commit: 1ebfaa11ebb5b603a3c3f54b2e84fcf1030f5a14

commit 1ebfaa11ebb5b603a3c3f54b2e84fcf1030f5a14 upstream.

Prior to commit 0baedd792713 ("KVM: x86: make Hyper-V PV TLB flush use
tlb_flush_guest()"), kvm_hv_flush_tlb() was using 'KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH |
KVM_REQUEST_NO_WAKEUP' when making a request to flush TLBs on other vCPUs
and KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH is/was defined as:

 (0 | KVM_REQUEST_WAIT | KVM_REQUEST_NO_WAKEUP)

so KVM_REQUEST_WAIT was lost. Hyper-V TLFS, however, requires that
"This call guarantees that by the time control returns back to the
caller, the observable effects of all flushes on the specified virtual
processors have occurred." and without KVM_REQUEST_WAIT there's a small
chance that the vCPU making the TLB flush will resume running before
all IPIs get delivered to other vCPUs and a stale mapping can get read
there.

Fix the issue by adding KVM_REQUEST_WAIT flag to KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST:
kvm_hv_flush_tlb() is the sole caller which uses it for
kvm_make_all_cpus_request()/kvm_make_vcpus_request_mask() where
KVM_REQUEST_WAIT makes a difference.

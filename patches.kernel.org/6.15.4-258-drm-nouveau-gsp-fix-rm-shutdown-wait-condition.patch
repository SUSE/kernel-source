Subject: [PATCH] drm/nouveau/gsp: fix rm shutdown wait condition
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: 7904bcdcf6b56602a049ed2b47282db63671fa99

[ Upstream commit 7904bcdcf6b56602a049ed2b47282db63671fa99 ]

Though the initial upstreamed GSP-RM version in nouveau was 535.113.01,
the code was developed against earlier versions.

535.42.02 modified the mailbox value used by GSP-RM to signal shutdown
has completed, which was missed at the time.

I'm not aware of any issues caused by this, but noticed the bug while
working on GB20x support.

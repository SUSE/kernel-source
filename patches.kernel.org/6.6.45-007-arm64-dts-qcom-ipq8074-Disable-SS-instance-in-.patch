Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: Disable SS instance in Parkmode
 for USB
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.45
Git-commit: dc6ba95c6c4400a84cca5b419b34ae852a08cfb5

[ Upstream commit dc6ba95c6c4400a84cca5b419b34ae852a08cfb5 ]

For Gen-1 targets like IPQ8074, it is seen that stressing out the
controller in host mode results in HC died error:

 xhci-hcd.12.auto: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
 xhci-hcd.12.auto: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
 xhci-hcd.12.auto: HC died; cleaning up

And at this instant only restarting the host mode fixes it. Disable
SuperSpeed instance in park mode for IPQ8074 to mitigate this issue.

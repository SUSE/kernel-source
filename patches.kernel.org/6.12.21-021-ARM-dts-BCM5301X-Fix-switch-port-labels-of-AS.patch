Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: BCM5301X: Fix switch port labels of ASUS RT-AC3200
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.21
Git-commit: 24d4c56dd68906bf55ff8fc2e2d36760f97dce5f

[ Upstream commit 24d4c56dd68906bf55ff8fc2e2d36760f97dce5f ]

After using the device for a while, Tom reports that he initially described
the switch port labels incorrectly. Apparently, ASUS's own firmware also
describes them incorrectly. Correct them to what is seen on the chassis.

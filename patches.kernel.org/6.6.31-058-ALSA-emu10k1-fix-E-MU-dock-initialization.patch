Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: emu10k1: fix E-MU dock initialization
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.31
Git-commit: e8289fd3fa65d60cf04dab6f7845eda352c04ea6

[ Upstream commit e8289fd3fa65d60cf04dab6f7845eda352c04ea6 ]

A side effect of making the dock monitoring interrupt-driven was that
we'd be very quick to program a freshly connected dock. However, for
unclear reasons, the dock does not work when we do that - despite the
FPGA netlist upload going just fine. We work around this by adding a
delay before programming the dock; for safety, the value is several
times as much as was determined empirically.

Note that a badly timed dock hot-plug would have triggered the problem
even before the referenced commit - but now it would happen 100% instead
of about 3% of the time, thus making it impossible to work around by
re-plugging.

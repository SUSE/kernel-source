Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: Increase CPU core voltage on STM32MP13xx
 DHCOR SoM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: a4422a9183278162093d4524fdf4b6bbd7dd8a28

[ Upstream commit a4422a9183278162093d4524fdf4b6bbd7dd8a28 ]

The STM32MP13xx DHCOR DHSBC is populated with STM32MP13xx part capable
of 1 GHz operation, increase the CPU core voltage to 1.35 V to make
sure the SoC is stable even if the blobs unconditionally force the CPU
to 1 GHz operation.

It is not possible to make use of CPUfreq on the STM32MP13xx because
the SCMI protocol 0x13 is not implemented by upstream OpTee-OS which
is the SCMI provider.

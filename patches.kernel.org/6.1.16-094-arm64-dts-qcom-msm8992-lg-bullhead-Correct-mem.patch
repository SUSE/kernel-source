Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8992-lg-bullhead: Correct memory
 overlaps with the SMEM and MPSS memory regions
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: d44106883d74992343710f18c4aaae937c7cefab

[ Upstream commit d44106883d74992343710f18c4aaae937c7cefab ]

The memory region reserved by a previous commit (see fixes tag below)
overlaps with the SMEM and MPSS memory regions, causing error messages in
dmesg:
	OF: reserved mem: OVERLAP DETECTED!
	reserved@5000000 (0x0000000005000000--0x0000000007200000)
	overlaps with smem_region@6a00000
	(0x0000000006a00000--0x0000000006c00000)

	OF: reserved mem: OVERLAP DETECTED!
	reserved@6c00000 (0x0000000006c00000--0x0000000007200000)
	overlaps with memory@7000000
	(0x0000000007000000--0x000000000ca00000)

This patch resolves both of these by splitting the previously reserved
memory region into two sections either side of the SMEM region and by
cutting off the second memory region to 0x7000000.

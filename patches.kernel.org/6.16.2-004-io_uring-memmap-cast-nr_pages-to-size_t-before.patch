Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/memmap: cast nr_pages to size_t before shifting
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: 33503c083fda048c77903460ac0429e1e2c0e341

commit 33503c083fda048c77903460ac0429e1e2c0e341 upstream.

If the allocated size exceeds UINT_MAX, then it's necessary to cast
the mr->nr_pages value to size_t to prevent it from overflowing. In
practice this isn't much of a concern as the required memory size will
have been validated upfront, and accounted to the user. And > 4GB sizes
will be necessary to make the lack of a cast a problem, which greatly
exceeds normal user locked_vm settings that are generally in the kb to
mb range. However, if root is used, then accounting isn't done, and
then it's possible to hit this issue.

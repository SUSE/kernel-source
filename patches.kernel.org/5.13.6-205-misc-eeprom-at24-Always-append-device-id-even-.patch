Subject: [PATCH] misc: eeprom: at24: Always append device id even if label
 property is set.

commit c36748ac545421d94a5091c754414c0f3664bf10 upstream.

We need to append device id even if eeprom have a label property set as some
platform can have multiple eeproms with same label and we can not register
each of those with same label. Failing to register those eeproms trigger
cascade failures on such platform (system is no longer working).

This fix regression on such platform introduced with 4e302c3b568e

Subject: [PATCH] bus: tegra-aconnect: Update dependency to ARCH_TEGRA
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 4acd21a45c1446277e2abaece97d7fa7c2e692a9

[ Upstream commit 4acd21a45c1446277e2abaece97d7fa7c2e692a9 ]

Update the architecture dependency to be the generic Tegra
because the driver works on the four latest Tegra generations
not just Tegra210, if you build a kernel with a specific
ARCH_TEGRA_xxx_SOC option that excludes Tegra210 you don't get
this driver.

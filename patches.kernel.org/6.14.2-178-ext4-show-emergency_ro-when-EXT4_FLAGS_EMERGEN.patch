Subject: [PATCH] ext4: show 'emergency_ro' when EXT4_FLAGS_EMERGENCY_RO is set
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: 6b76715d5e41fc332b0b879e66fad6ef3db07a3f

[ Upstream commit 6b76715d5e41fc332b0b879e66fad6ef3db07a3f ]

After commit d3476f3dad4a ("ext4: don't set SB_RDONLY after filesystem
errors") in v6.12-rc1, the 'errors=remount-ro' mode no longer sets
SB_RDONLY on errors, which results in us seeing the filesystem is still
in rw state after errors.

Therefore, after setting EXT4_FLAGS_EMERGENCY_RO, display the emergency_ro
option so that users can query whether the current file system has become
emergency read-only due to errors through commands such as 'mount' or
'cat /proc/fs/ext4/sdx/options'.

Fixes: d3476f3dad4a ("ext4: don't set SB_RDONLY after filesystem errors")

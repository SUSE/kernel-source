Subject: [PATCH] soc: qcom: socinfo: rename PM2250 to PM4125
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 5155e48128826d0c5999dc9f47aa746df54da448

[ Upstream commit 5155e48128826d0c5999dc9f47aa746df54da448 ]

It seems, the only actual mentions of PM2250 can be found are related to
the Qualcomm RB1 platform. However even RB1 schematics use PM4125 as a
PMIC name. Rename PM2250 to PM4125 to follow the documentation.

Fixes: 082f9bc60f33 ("soc: qcom: spmi-pmic: add more PMIC SUBTYPE IDs")
Fixes: 112d96fd2927 ("soc: qcom: socinfo: Add some PMICs")

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "clocksource/drivers/riscv: Events are stopped during
 CPU suspend"
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit d9f15a9de44affe733e34f93bc184945ba277e6d ]

This reverts commit 232ccac1bd9b5bfe73895f527c08623e7fa0752d.

On the subject of suspend, the RISC-V SBI spec states:

  This does not cover whether any given events actually reach the hart or
  not, just what the hart will do if it receives an event. On PolarFire
  SoC, and potentially other SiFive based implementations, events from the
  RISC-V timer do reach a hart during suspend. This is not the case for the
  implementation on the Allwinner D1 - there timer events are not received
  during suspend.

To fix this, the CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP (mis)feature was enabled for the
timer driver - but this has broken both RCU stall detection and timers
generally on PolarFire SoC and potentially other SiFive based
implementations.

If an AXI read to the PCIe controller on PolarFire SoC times out, the
system will stall, however, with CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP active, the system
just locks up without RCU stalling:

Similarly issues were reported with clock_nanosleep() - with a test app
that sleeps each cpu for 6, 5, 4, 3 ms respectively, HZ=250 & the blamed
commit in place, the sleep times are rounded up to the next jiffy:

Fortunately, the D1 has a second timer, which is "currently used in
preference to the RISC-V/SBI timer driver" so a revert here does not
hurt operation of D1 in its current form.

Ultimately, a DeviceTree property (or node) will be added to encode the
behaviour of the timers, but until then revert the addition of
CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP.

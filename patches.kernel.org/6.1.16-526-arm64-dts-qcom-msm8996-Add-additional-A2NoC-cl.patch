Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Add additional A2NoC clocks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 67fb53745e0b38275fa0b422b6a3c6c1c028c9a2

[ Upstream commit 67fb53745e0b38275fa0b422b6a3c6c1c028c9a2 ]

On eMMC devices, the UFS clocks aren't started in the bootloader (or well,
at least it should not be, as that would just leak power..), which results
in platform reboots when trying to access the unclocked UFS hardware,
which unfortunately happens on each and every boot, as interconnect calls
sync_state and goes over each and every path.

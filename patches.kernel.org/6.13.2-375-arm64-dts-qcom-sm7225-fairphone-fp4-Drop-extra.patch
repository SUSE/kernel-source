Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm7225-fairphone-fp4: Drop extra
 qcom,msm-id value
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: 7fb88e0d4dc1a40a29d49b603faa1484334c60f3

[ Upstream commit 7fb88e0d4dc1a40a29d49b603faa1484334c60f3 ]

The ID 434 is for SM6350 while 459 is for SM7225. Fairphone 4 is only
SM7225, so drop the unused 434 entry.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Validate DSC After Enable All New CRTCs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 876fcc4222e1d0e5b73343f4010a8b66be058f48

commit 876fcc4222e1d0e5b73343f4010a8b66be058f48 upstream.

Before enabling new crtc, stream_count in dc_state does not sync with
that in drm_atomic_state. Validating dsc in such case would leave newly
added stream not jointly participating in dsc optimization with existing
streams, but simply using default initialized vcpi all the time which
gives wrong dsc determination decision.

Consider the scenaio where one 4k60 connected to the dock under dp-alt mode.
Since dp-alt mode is 2-lane setup, stream 1 consumes 63 slots with dsc needed.
Then hook up a second 4k60 to the dock.
stream 2 connected with 65 slot initialized by default without dsc.  dsc
pre validate will not jointly optimize stream 2 with stream 1 before
crtc 2 added into the dc_state. That leads to stream 2 not getting dsc
optimization, and trigger atomic_check failure all the time, as 65 > 63
limit.

After getting all new crtcs added into the state, stream_count in
dc_state correctly reflect that in drm_atomic_state which comes up with
correct dsc decision.

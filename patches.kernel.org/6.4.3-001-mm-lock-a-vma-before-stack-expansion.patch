Subject: [PATCH] mm: lock a vma before stack expansion
Patch-mainline: 6.4.3
References: bsc#1012628 bsc#1212775
Git-commit: c137381f71aec755fbf47cd4e9bd4dce752c054c

commit c137381f71aec755fbf47cd4e9bd4dce752c054c upstream.

With recent changes necessitating mmap_lock to be held for write while
expanding a stack, per-VMA locks should follow the same rules and be
write-locked to prevent page faults into the VMA being expanded. Add
the necessary locking.

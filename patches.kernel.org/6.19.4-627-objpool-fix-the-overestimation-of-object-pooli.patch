Subject: [PATCH] objpool: fix the overestimation of object pooling metadata
 size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: 5ed4b6b37c647d168ae31035b3f61b705997e043

[ Upstream commit 5ed4b6b37c647d168ae31035b3f61b705997e043 ]

objpool uses struct objpool_head to store metadata information, and its
cpu_slots member points to an array of pointers that store the addresses
of the percpu ring arrays.  However, the memory size allocated during the
initialization of cpu_slots is nr_cpu_ids * sizeof(struct objpool_slot).
On a 64-bit machine, the size of struct objpool_slot is 16 bytes, which is
twice the size of the actual pointer required, and the extra memory is
never be used, resulting in a waste of memory.  Therefore, the memory size
required for cpu_slots needs to be corrected.

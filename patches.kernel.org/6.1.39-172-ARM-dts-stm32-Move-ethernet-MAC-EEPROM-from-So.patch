Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: Move ethernet MAC EEPROM from SoM to carrier
 boards
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 9660efc2af37f3c12dc6e6a5511ad99e0addc297

[ Upstream commit 9660efc2af37f3c12dc6e6a5511ad99e0addc297 ]

The ethernet MAC EEPROM is not populated on the SoM itself, it has to be
populated on each carrier board. Move the EEPROM into the correct place
in DTs, i.e. the carrier board DTs. Add label to the EEPROM too.

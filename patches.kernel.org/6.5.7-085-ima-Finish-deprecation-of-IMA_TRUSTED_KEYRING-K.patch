Subject: [PATCH] ima: Finish deprecation of IMA_TRUSTED_KEYRING Kconfig
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.7
Git-commit: be210c6d3597faf330cb9af33b9f1591d7b2a983

[ Upstream commit be210c6d3597faf330cb9af33b9f1591d7b2a983 ]

The removal of IMA_TRUSTED_KEYRING made IMA_LOAD_X509
and IMA_BLACKLIST_KEYRING unavailable because the latter
two depend on the former. Since IMA_TRUSTED_KEYRING was
deprecated in favor of INTEGRITY_TRUSTED_KEYRING use it
as a dependency for the two Kconfigs affected by the
deprecation.

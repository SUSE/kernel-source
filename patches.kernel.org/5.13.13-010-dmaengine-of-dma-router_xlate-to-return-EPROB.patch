Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: of-dma: router_xlate to return -EPROBE_DEFER if
 controller is not yet available
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.13
Git-commit: eda97cb095f2958bbad55684a6ca3e7d7af0176a

[ Upstream commit eda97cb095f2958bbad55684a6ca3e7d7af0176a ]

If the router_xlate can not find the controller in the available DMA
devices then it should return with -EPORBE_DEFER in a same way as the
of_dma_request_slave_channel() does.

The issue can be reproduced if the event router is registered before the
DMA controller itself and a driver would request for a channel before the
controller is registered.
In of_dma_request_slave_channel():
1. of_dma_find_controller() would find the dma_router
2. ofdma->of_dma_xlate() would fail and returned NULL
3. -ENODEV is returned as error code

with this patch we would return in this case the correct -EPROBE_DEFER and
the client can try to request the channel later.

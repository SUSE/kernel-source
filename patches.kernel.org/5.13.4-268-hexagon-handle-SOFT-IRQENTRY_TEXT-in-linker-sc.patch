Subject: [PATCH] hexagon: handle {,SOFT}IRQENTRY_TEXT in linker script
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: 6fef087d0d37ba7dba8f3d75566eb4c256cd6742

[ Upstream commit 6fef087d0d37ba7dba8f3d75566eb4c256cd6742 ]

Patch series "hexagon: Fix build error with CONFIG_STACKDEPOT and select CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_LD_ORPHAN_WARN".

This series fixes an error with ARCH=hexagon that was pointed out by the
patch "mm/slub: use stackdepot to save stack trace in objects".

The first patch fixes that error by handling the '.irqentry.text' and
'.softirqentry.text' sections.

The second patch switches Hexagon over to the common DISCARDS macro, which
should have been done when Hexagon was merged into the tree to match
commit 023bf6f1b8bf ("linker script: unify usage of discard definition").

The third patch selects CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_LD_ORPHAN_WARN so that something
like this does not happen again.

This patch (of 3):

Patch "mm/slub: use stackdepot to save stack trace in objects" in -mm
selects CONFIG_STACKDEPOT when CONFIG_STACKTRACE_SUPPORT is selected and
CONFIG_STACKDEPOT requires IRQENTRY_TEXT and SOFTIRQENTRY_TEXT to be
handled after commit 505a0ef15f96 ("kasan: stackdepot: move
filter_irq_stacks() to stackdepot.c") due to the use of the
__{,soft}irqentry_text_{start,end} section symbols.  If those sections are
not handled, the build is broken.

$ make ARCH=hexagon CROSS_COMPILE=hexagon-linux- LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 defconfig all
...
ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: __irqentry_text_start

Add these sections to the Hexagon linker script so the build continues to
work.  ld.lld's orphan section warning would have caught this prior to the
-mm commit mentioned above:

ld.lld: warning: kernel/built-in.a(softirq.o):(.softirqentry.text) is being placed in '.softirqentry.text'
ld.lld: warning: kernel/built-in.a(softirq.o):(.softirqentry.text) is being placed in '.softirqentry.text'
ld.lld: warning: kernel/built-in.a(softirq.o):(.softirqentry.text) is being placed in '.softirqentry.text'

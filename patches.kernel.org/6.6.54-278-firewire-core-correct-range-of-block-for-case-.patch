Subject: [PATCH] firewire: core: correct range of block for case of switch
 statement
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.54
Git-commit: ebb9d3ca8f7efc1b6a2f1750d1058eda444883d0

[ Upstream commit ebb9d3ca8f7efc1b6a2f1750d1058eda444883d0 ]

A commit d8527cab6c31 ("firewire: cdev: implement new event to notify
response subaction with time stamp") adds an additional case,
FW_CDEV_EVENT_RESPONSE2, into switch statement in complete_transaction().
However, the range of block is beyond to the case label and reaches
neibour default label.

This commit corrects the range of block. Fortunately, it has few impacts
in practice since the local variable in the scope under the label is not
used in codes under default label.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Remove hdmi's 2nd interrupt on rk3328
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.61
Git-commit: de50a7e3681771c6b990238af82bf1dea9b11b21

[ Upstream commit de50a7e3681771c6b990238af82bf1dea9b11b21 ]

The "synopsys,dw-hdmi.yaml" binding specifies that the interrupts
property of the hdmi node has 'maxItems: 1', so the hdmi node in
rk3328.dtsi having 2 is incorrect.

Paragraph 1.3 ("System Interrupt connection") of the RK3328 TRM v1.1
page 16 and 17 define the following hdmi related interrupts:
-  67 hdmi_intr
- 103 hdmi_intr_wakeup

The difference of 32 is due to a different base used in the TRM.

The RK3399 (which uses the same binding) has '23: hdmi_irq' and
'24: hdmi_wakeup_irq' according to its TRM (page 19).
The RK3568 (also same binding) has '76: hdmi_wakeup' and '77: hdmi'
according to page 17 of its TRM.
In both cases the non-wakeup IRQ was used, so use that too for rk3328.

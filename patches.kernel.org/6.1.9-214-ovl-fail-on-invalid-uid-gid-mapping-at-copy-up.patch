Subject: [PATCH] ovl: fail on invalid uid/gid mapping at copy up
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.9
Git-commit: 4f11ada10d0ad3fd53e2bd67806351de63a4f9c3

commit 4f11ada10d0ad3fd53e2bd67806351de63a4f9c3 upstream.

If st_uid/st_gid doesn't have a mapping in the mounter's user_ns, then
copy-up should fail, just like it would fail if the mounter task was doing
the copy using "cp -a".

There's a corner case where the "cp -a" would succeed but copy up fail: if
there's a mapping of the invalid uid/gid (65534 by default) in the user
namespace.  This is because stat(2) will return this value if the mapping
doesn't exist in the current user_ns and "cp -a" will in turn be able to
create a file with this uid/gid.

This behavior would be inconsistent with POSIX ACL's, which return -1 for
invalid uid/gid which result in a failed copy.

For consistency and simplicity fail the copy of the st_uid/st_gid are
invalid.

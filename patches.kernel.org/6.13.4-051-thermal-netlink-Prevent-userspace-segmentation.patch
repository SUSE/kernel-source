Subject: [PATCH] thermal/netlink: Prevent userspace segmentation fault by
 adjusting UAPI header
Patch-mainline: 6.13.4
References: bsc#1012628 bsc#1237219
Git-commit: c195b9c6ab9c383d7aa3f4a65879b3ca90cb378b

[ Upstream commit c195b9c6ab9c383d7aa3f4a65879b3ca90cb378b ]

The intel-lpmd tool [1], which uses the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY
attribute to receive HFI events from kernel space, encounters a
segmentation fault after commit 1773572863c4 ("thermal: netlink: Add the
commands and the events for the thresholds").

The issue arises because the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY raw value
was changed while intel_lpmd still uses the old value.

Although intel_lpmd can be updated to check the THERMAL_GENL_VERSION and
use the appropriate THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY value, the commit
itself is questionable.

The commit introduced a new element in the middle of enum thermal_genl_attr,
which affects many existing attributes and introduces potential risks
and unnecessary maintenance burdens for userspace thermal netlink event
users.

Solve the issue by moving the newly introduced
THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_TZ_PREV_TEMP attribute to the end of the
enum thermal_genl_attr. This ensures that all existing thermal generic
netlink attributes remain unaffected.

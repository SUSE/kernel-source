Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: Make drivers using CPUFREQ_ETERNAL specify
 transition latency
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.54
Git-commit: f97aef092e199c10a3da96ae79b571edd5362faa

[ Upstream commit f97aef092e199c10a3da96ae79b571edd5362faa ]

Commit a755d0e2d41b ("cpufreq: Honour transition_latency over
transition_delay_us") caused platforms where cpuinfo.transition_latency
is CPUFREQ_ETERNAL to get a very large transition latency whereas
previously it had been capped at 10 ms (and later at 2 ms).

This led to a user-observable regression between 6.6 and 6.12 as
described by Shawn:

"The dbs sampling_rate was 10000 us on 6.6 and suddently becomes
 6442450 us (4294967295 / 1000 * 1.5) on 6.12 for these platforms
 because the default transition delay was dropped [...].

 It slows down dbs governor's reacting to CPU loading change
 dramatically.  Also, as transition_delay_us is used by schedutil
 governor as rate_limit_us, it shows a negative impact on device
 idle power consumption, because the device gets slightly less time
 in the lowest OPP."

Evidently, the expectation of the drivers using CPUFREQ_ETERNAL as
cpuinfo.transition_latency was that it would be capped by the core,
but they may as well return a default transition latency value instead
of CPUFREQ_ETERNAL and the core need not do anything with it.

Accordingly, introduce CPUFREQ_DEFAULT_TRANSITION_LATENCY_NS and make
all of the drivers in question use it instead of CPUFREQ_ETERNAL.  Also
update the related Rust binding.

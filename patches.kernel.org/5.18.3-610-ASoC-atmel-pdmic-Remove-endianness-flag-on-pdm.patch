Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: atmel-pdmic: Remove endianness flag on pdmic component
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 52857c3baa0e5ddeba7b2c84e56bb71c9674e048

[ Upstream commit 52857c3baa0e5ddeba7b2c84e56bb71c9674e048 ]

The endianness flag should have been removed when the driver was
ported across from having both a CODEC and CPU side component, to
just having a CPU component and using the dummy for the CODEC. The
endianness flag is used to indicate that the device is completely
ambivalent to the endianness of the data, typically due to the
endianness being lost over the hardware link (ie. the link defines
bit ordering). It's usage didn't have any effect when the driver
had both a CPU and CODEC component, since the union of those equals
the CPU side settings, but now causes the driver to falsely report
it supports big endian. Correct this by removing the flag.

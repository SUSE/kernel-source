Subject: [PATCH] neigh: make sure used and confirmed times are valid
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.15
Git-commit: c1d2ecdf5e38e3489ce8328238b558b3b2866fe1

[ Upstream commit c1d2ecdf5e38e3489ce8328238b558b3b2866fe1 ]

Entries can linger in cache without timer for days, thanks to
the gc_thresh1 limit. As result, without traffic, the confirmed
time can be outdated and to appear to be in the future. Later,
on traffic, NUD_STALE entries can switch to NUD_DELAY and start
the timer which can see the invalid confirmed time and wrongly
switch to NUD_REACHABLE state instead of NUD_PROBE. As result,
timer is set many days in the future. This is more visible on
32-bit platforms, with higher HZ value.

Why this is a problem? While we expect unused entries to expire,
such entries stay in REACHABLE state for too long, locked in
cache. They are not expired normally, only when cache is full.

Problem and the wrong state change reported by Zhang Changzhong:

172.16.1.18 dev bond0 lladdr 0a:0e:0f:01:12:01 ref 1 used 350521/15994171/350520 probes 4 REACHABLE

350520 seconds have elapsed since this entry was last updated, but it is
still in the REACHABLE state (base_reachable_time_ms is 30000),
preventing lladdr from being updated through probe.

Fix it by ensuring timer is started with valid used/confirmed
times. Considering the valid time range is LONG_MAX jiffies,
we try not to go too much in the past while we are in
DELAY/PROBE state. There are also places that need
used/updated times to be validated while timer is not running.

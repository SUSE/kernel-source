Subject: [PATCH] x86/lam: Disable ADDRESS_MASKING in most cases
References: bsc#1012628 CVE-2024-50112 bsc#1232867
Patch-mainline: 6.11.6
Git-commit: 3267cb6d3a174ff83d6287dcd5b0047bbd912452

commit 3267cb6d3a174ff83d6287dcd5b0047bbd912452 upstream.

Linear Address Masking (LAM) has a weakness related to transient
execution as described in the SLAM paper[1]. Unless Linear Address
Space Separation (LASS) is enabled this weakness may be exploitable.

Until kernel adds support for LASS[2], only allow LAM for COMPILE_TEST,
or when speculation mitigations have been disabled at compile time,
otherwise keep LAM disabled.

There are no processors in market that support LAM yet, so currently
nobody is affected by this issue.

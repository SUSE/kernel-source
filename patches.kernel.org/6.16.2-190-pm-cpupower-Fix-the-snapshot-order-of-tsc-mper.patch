Subject: [PATCH] pm: cpupower: Fix the snapshot-order of tsc,mperf, clock in
 mperf_stop()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: cda7ac8ce7de84cf32a3871ba5f318aa3b79381e

[ Upstream commit cda7ac8ce7de84cf32a3871ba5f318aa3b79381e ]

In the function mperf_start(), mperf_monitor snapshots the time, tsc
and finally the aperf,mperf MSRs. However, this order of snapshotting
in is reversed in mperf_stop(). As a result, the C0 residency (which
is computed as delta_mperf * 100 / delta_tsc) is under-reported on
CPUs that is 100% busy.

Fix this by snapshotting time, tsc and then aperf,mperf in
mperf_stop() in the same order as in mperf_start().

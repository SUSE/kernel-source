Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6ul-pico-dwarf: Use 'clock-frequency'
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.9
Git-commit: 94e2cf1e0db5b06c7a6ae0878c5cbec925819a8a

[ Upstream commit 94e2cf1e0db5b06c7a6ae0878c5cbec925819a8a ]

'clock_frequency' is not a valid property.

Use the correct 'clock-frequency' instead.

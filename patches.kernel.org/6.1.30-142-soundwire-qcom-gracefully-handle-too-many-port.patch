Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: qcom: gracefully handle too many ports in DT
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: 2367e0ecb498764e95cfda691ff0828f7d25f9a4

[ Upstream commit 2367e0ecb498764e95cfda691ff0828f7d25f9a4 ]

There are two issues related to the number of ports coming from
Devicetree when exceeding in total QCOM_SDW_MAX_PORTS.  Both lead to
incorrect memory accesses:
1. With DTS having too big value of input or output ports, the driver,
   when copying port parameters from local/stack arrays into 'pconfig'
   array in 'struct qcom_swrm_ctrl', will iterate over their sizes.

2. If DTS also has too many parameters for these ports (e.g.
   qcom,ports-sinterval-low), the driver will overflow buffers on the
   stack when reading these properties from DTS.

Add a sanity check so incorrect DTS will not cause kernel memory
corruption.

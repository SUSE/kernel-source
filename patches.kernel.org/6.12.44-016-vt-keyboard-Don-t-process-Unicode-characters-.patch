Subject: [PATCH] vt: keyboard: Don't process Unicode characters in K_OFF mode
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.44
Git-commit: b1cc2092ea7a52e2c435aee6d2b1bcb773202663

commit b1cc2092ea7a52e2c435aee6d2b1bcb773202663 upstream.

We don't process Unicode characters if the virtual terminal is in raw
mode, so there's no reason why we shouldn't do the same for K_OFF
(especially since people would expect K_OFF to actually turn off all VT
key processing).

Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: use dp_ctrl_off_link_stream during PHY compliance
 test run
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.8
Git-commit: 7591c532b818ef4b8e3e635d842547c08b3a32b4

[ Upstream commit 7591c532b818ef4b8e3e635d842547c08b3a32b4 ]

DP cable should always connect to DPU during the entire PHY compliance
testing run. Since DP PHY compliance test is executed at irq_hpd event
context, dp_ctrl_off_link_stream() should be used instead of dp_ctrl_off().
dp_ctrl_off() is used for unplug event which is triggered when DP cable is
dis connected.

Changes in V2:
-- add fixes statement

Fixes: f21c8a276c2d ("drm/msm/dp: handle irq_hpd with sink_count = 0 correctly")

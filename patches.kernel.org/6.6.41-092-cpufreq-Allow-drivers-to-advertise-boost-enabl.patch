Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: Allow drivers to advertise boost enabled
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.41
Git-commit: 102fa9c4b439ca3bd93d13fb53f5b7592d96a109

commit 102fa9c4b439ca3bd93d13fb53f5b7592d96a109 upstream.

The behavior introduced in commit f37a4d6b4a2c ("cpufreq: Fix per-policy
boost behavior on SoCs using cpufreq_boost_set_sw()") sets up the boost
policy incorrectly when boost has been enabled by the platform firmware
initially even if a driver sets the policy up.

This is because policy_has_boost_freq() assumes that there is a frequency
table set up by the driver and that the boost frequencies are advertised
in that table. This assumption doesn't work for acpi-cpufreq or
amd-pstate. Only use this check to enable boost if it's not already
enabled instead of also disabling it if alreayd enabled.

Fixes: f37a4d6b4a2c ("cpufreq: Fix per-policy boost behavior on SoCs using cpufreq_boost_set_sw()")

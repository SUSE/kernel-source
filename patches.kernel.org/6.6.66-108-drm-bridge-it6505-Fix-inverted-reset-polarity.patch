Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: it6505: Fix inverted reset polarity
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.66
Git-commit: c5f3f21728b069412e8072b8b1d0a3d9d3ab0265

[ Upstream commit c5f3f21728b069412e8072b8b1d0a3d9d3ab0265 ]

The IT6505 bridge chip has a active low reset line. Since it is a
"reset" and not an "enable" line, the GPIO should be asserted to
put it in reset and deasserted to bring it out of reset during
the power on sequence.

The polarity was inverted when the driver was first introduced, likely
because the device family that was targeted had an inverting level
shifter on the reset line.

The MT8186 Corsola devices already have the IT6505 in their device tree,
but the whole display pipeline is actually disabled and won't be enabled
until some remaining issues are sorted out. The other known user is
the MT8183 Kukui / Jacuzzi family; their device trees currently do not
have the IT6505 included.

Fix the polarity in the driver while there are no actual users.

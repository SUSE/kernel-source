Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp: fix ufs_card_phy ref clock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: 8d6b458ce6e93286a607e54f787f7a86067f58bd

[ Upstream commit 8d6b458ce6e93286a607e54f787f7a86067f58bd ]

The GCC_UFS_REF_CLKREF_CLK must be enabled or the second UFS controller
fails to enumerate on sa8295p-adp.

Note that the vendor kernel enables both GCC_UFS_REF_CLKREF_CLK and
GCC_UFS_1_CARD_CLKREF_CLK and it is possible that the former should be
modelled as a parent of the latter. The clock driver also has a
GCC_UFS_CARD_CLKREF_CLK clock which the firmware appears to enable on
the ADP.

The usual lack of documentation for Qualcomm SoCs makes this a highly
annoying guessing game, but as the second controller works on the ADP
without either card reference clock enabled, only enable
GCC_UFS_REF_CLKREF_CLK for now.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Mark PCIe controller as cache
 coherent
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.9
Git-commit: 8a63441e83724fee1ef3fd37b237d40d90780766

commit 8a63441e83724fee1ef3fd37b237d40d90780766 upstream.

If the controller is not marked as cache coherent, then kernel will
try to ensure coherency during dma-ops and that may cause data corruption.
So, mark the PCIe node as dma-coherent as the devices on PCIe bus are
cache coherent.

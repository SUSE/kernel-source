Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon/core: handle damon_call_control as normal under
 kdmond deactivation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.7
Git-commit: bb1b5929b4279b136816f95ce1e8f1fa689bf4a1

commit bb1b5929b4279b136816f95ce1e8f1fa689bf4a1 upstream.

DAMON sysfs interface internally uses damon_call() to update DAMON
parameters as users requested, online.  However, DAMON core cancels any
damon_call() requests when it is deactivated by DAMOS watermarks.

As a result, users cannot change DAMON parameters online while DAMON is
deactivated.  Note that users can turn DAMON off and on with different
watermarks to work around.  Since deactivated DAMON is nearly same to
stopped DAMON, the work around should have no big problem.  Anyway, a bug
is a bug.

There is no real good reason to cancel the damon_call() request under
DAMOS deactivation.  Fix it by simply handling the request as normal,
rather than cancelling under the situation.

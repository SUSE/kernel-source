commit bfe55a1f7fd6bfede16078bf04c6250fbca11588 upstream.

Add and ACPI idle power level limit for 32-bit ThinkPad T40.

There is a regression on T40 introduced by commit d6b88ce2, starting
with kernel 5.16:

  ACPI: processor idle: Allow playing dead in C3 state

The above patch is trying to enter C3 state during init, what is causing
a T40 system freeze. I have not found a similar issue on any other of my
32-bit machines.

The fix is to add another exception to the processor_power_dmi_table[] list.
As a result the dmesg shows as expected:

[2.155398] ACPI: IBM ThinkPad T40 detected - limiting to C2 max_cstate. Override with "processor.max_cstate=9"
[2.155404] ACPI: processor limited to max C-state 2

The fix is trivial and affects only vintage T40 systems.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: parade-ps8640: Fix regulator supply order
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: fc94224c2e0ae8d83ac511a3ef4962178505469d

[ Upstream commit fc94224c2e0ae8d83ac511a3ef4962178505469d ]

The datasheet says that VDD12 must be enabled and at full voltage before
VDD33 is enabled.

Reorder the bulk regulator supply names so that VDD12 is enabled before
VDD33. Any enable ramp delays should be handled by setting proper
constraints on the regulators.

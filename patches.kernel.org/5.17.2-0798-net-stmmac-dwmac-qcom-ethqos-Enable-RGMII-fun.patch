Subject: [PATCH] net: stmmac: dwmac-qcom-ethqos: Enable RGMII functional clock
 on resume
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: ffba2123e1714a27e9362fda57c42155dda37efc

[ Upstream commit ffba2123e1714a27e9362fda57c42155dda37efc ]

When the Qualcomm ethqos driver is properly described in its associated
GDSC power-domain, the hardware will be powered down and loose its state
between qcom_ethqos_probe() and stmmac_init_dma_engine().

The result of this is that the functional clock from the RGMII IO macro
is no longer provides and the DMA software reset in dwmac4_dma_reset()
will time out, due to lacking clock signal.

Re-enable the functional clock, as part of the Qualcomm specific clock
enablement sequence to avoid this problem.

The final clock configuration will be adjusted by ethqos_fix_mac_speed()
once the link is being brought up.

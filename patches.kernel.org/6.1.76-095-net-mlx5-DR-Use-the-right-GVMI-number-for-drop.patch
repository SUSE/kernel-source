Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5: DR, Use the right GVMI number for drop action
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.76
Git-commit: 5665954293f13642f9c052ead83c1e9d8cff186f

[ Upstream commit 5665954293f13642f9c052ead83c1e9d8cff186f ]

When FW provides ICM addresses for drop RX/TX, the provided capability
is 64 bits that contain its GVMI as well as the ICM address itself.
In case of TX DROP this GVMI is different from the GVMI that the
domain is operating on.

This patch fixes the action to use these GVMI IDs, as provided by FW.

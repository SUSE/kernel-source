Subject: [PATCH] libbpf: Do not close un-owned FD 0 on errors
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.12
Git-commit: c34c338a40e4f3b6f80889cd17fd9281784d1c32

[ Upstream commit c34c338a40e4f3b6f80889cd17fd9281784d1c32 ]

Before this patch, btf_new() was liable to close an arbitrary FD 0 if
BTF parsing failed. This was because:

* btf->fd was initialized to 0 through the calloc()
* btf__free() (in the `done` label) closed any FDs >= 0
* btf->fd is left at 0 if parsing fails

This issue was discovered on a system using libbpf v0.3 (without
BTF_KIND_FLOAT support) but with a kernel that had BTF_KIND_FLOAT types
in BTF. Thus, parsing fails.

While this patch technically doesn't fix any issues b/c upstream libbpf
has BTF_KIND_FLOAT support, it'll help prevent issues in the future if
more BTF types are added. It also allow the fix to be backported to
older libbpf's.

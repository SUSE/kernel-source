Subject: [PATCH] mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix IPv4 nexthop gateway indication
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.15
Git-commit: e5ec6a2513383fe2ecc2ee3b5f51d97acbbcd4d8

commit e5ec6a2513383fe2ecc2ee3b5f51d97acbbcd4d8 upstream.

mlxsw needs to distinguish nexthops with a gateway from connected
nexthops in order to write the former to the adjacency table of the
device. The check used to rely on the fact that nexthops with a gateway
have a 'link' scope whereas connected nexthops have a 'host' scope. This
is no longer correct after commit 747c14307214 ("ip: fix dflt addr
selection for connected nexthop").

Fix that by instead checking the address family of the gateway IP. This
is a more direct way and also consistent with the IPv6 counterpart in
mlxsw_sp_rt6_is_gateway().

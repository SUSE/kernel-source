Subject: [PATCH] scsi: libsas: Fix exp-attached device scan after probe
 failure scanned in again after probe failed
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.42
Git-commit: ab2068a6fb84751836a84c26ca72b3beb349619d

[ Upstream commit ab2068a6fb84751836a84c26ca72b3beb349619d ]

The expander phy will be treated as broadcast flutter in the next
revalidation after the exp-attached end device probe failed, as follows:

The cause of the problem is that the related ex_phy's attached_sas_addr was
not cleared after the end device probe failed, so reset it.

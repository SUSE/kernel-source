Subject: [PATCH] net: bridge: Do not offload IGMP/MLD messages
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.40
Git-commit: 683dc24da8bf199bb7446e445ad7f801c79a550e

[ Upstream commit 683dc24da8bf199bb7446e445ad7f801c79a550e ]

Do not offload IGMP/MLD messages as it could lead to IGMP/MLD Reports
being unintentionally flooded to Hosts. Instead, let the bridge decide
where to send these IGMP/MLD messages.

Consider the case where the local host is sending out reports in response
to a remote querier like the following:

       mcast-listener-process (IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP)
          \
          br0
         /   \
      swp1   swp2
        |     |
  QUERIER     SOME-OTHER-HOST

In the above setup, br0 will want to br_forward() reports for
mcast-listener-process's group(s) via swp1 to QUERIER; but since the
source hwdom is 0, the report is eligible for tx offloading, and is
flooded by hardware to both swp1 and swp2, reaching SOME-OTHER-HOST as
well. (Example and illustration provided by Tobias.)

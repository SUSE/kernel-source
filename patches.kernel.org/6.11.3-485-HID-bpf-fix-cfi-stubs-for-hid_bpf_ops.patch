Subject: [PATCH] HID: bpf: fix cfi stubs for hid_bpf_ops
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.3
Git-commit: acd5f76fd5292c91628e04da83e8b78c986cfa2b

commit acd5f76fd5292c91628e04da83e8b78c986cfa2b upstream.

With the introduction of commit e42ac1418055 ("bpf: Check unsupported ops
from the bpf_struct_ops's cfi_stubs"), a HID-BPF struct_ops containing
a .hid_hw_request() or a .hid_hw_output_report() was failing to load
as the cfi stubs were not defined.

Fix that by defining those simple static functions and restore HID-BPF
functionality.

This was detected with the HID selftests suddenly failing on Linus' tree.

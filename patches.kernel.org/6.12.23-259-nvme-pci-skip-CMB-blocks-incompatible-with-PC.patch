Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: skip CMB blocks incompatible with PCI P2P DMA
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.23
Git-commit: 56cf7ef0d490b28fad8f8629fc135c5ab7c9f54e

[ Upstream commit 56cf7ef0d490b28fad8f8629fc135c5ab7c9f54e ]

The PCI P2PDMA code will register the CMB block to the memory
hot-plugging subsystem, which have an alignment requirement. Memory
blocks that do not satisfy this alignment requirement (usually 2MB) will
lead to a WARNING from memory hotplugging.

Verify the CMB block's address and size against the alignment and only
try to send CMB blocks compatible with it to prevent this warning.

Tested on Intel DC D4502 SSD, which has a 512K CMB block that is too
small for memory hotplugging (thus PCI P2PDMA).

Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: pass netlink extack to mqprio and taprio offload
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.4
Git-commit: c54876cd5961ce0f8e74807f79a6739cd6b35ddf

[ Upstream commit c54876cd5961ce0f8e74807f79a6739cd6b35ddf ]

With the multiplexed ndo_setup_tc() model which lacks a first-class
struct netlink_ext_ack * argument, the only way to pass the netlink
extended ACK message down to the device driver is to embed it within the
offload structure.

Do this for struct tc_mqprio_qopt_offload and struct tc_taprio_qopt_offload.

Since struct tc_taprio_qopt_offload also contains a tc_mqprio_qopt_offload
structure, and since device drivers might effectively reuse their mqprio
implementation for the mqprio portion of taprio, we make taprio set the
extack in both offload structures to point at the same netlink extack
message.

In fact, the taprio handling is a bit more tricky, for 2 reasons.

First is because the offload structure has a longer lifetime than the
extack structure. The driver is supposed to populate the extack
synchronously from ndo_setup_tc() and leave it alone afterwards.
To not have any use-after-free surprises, we zero out the extack pointer
when we leave taprio_enable_offload().

The second reason is because taprio does overwrite the extack message on
ndo_setup_tc() error. We need to switch to the weak form of setting an
extack message, which preserves a potential message set by the driver.

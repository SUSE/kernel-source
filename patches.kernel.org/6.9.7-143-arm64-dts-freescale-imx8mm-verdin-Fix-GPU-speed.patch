Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: freescale: imx8mm-verdin: Fix GPU speed
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.7
Git-commit: 08f0fa5d6aa9488f752eb5410e32636f143b3d8e

[ Upstream commit 08f0fa5d6aa9488f752eb5410e32636f143b3d8e ]

The GPU clock was reduced on iMX8MM SOC device tree to prevent boards
that don't support GPU overdrive from being out of specification. However,
this caused a regression in GPU speed for the Verdin iMX8MM, which does
support GPU overdrive. This patch fixes this by enabling overdrive mode
in the SOM dtsi.

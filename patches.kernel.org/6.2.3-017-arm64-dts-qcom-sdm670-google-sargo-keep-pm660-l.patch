Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm670-google-sargo: keep pm660 ldo8 on
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.3
Git-commit: 861b67fbdccd62a9319d7350b1924d95f597db09

[ Upstream commit 861b67fbdccd62a9319d7350b1924d95f597db09 ]

According to the downstream device tree, the regulator that powers the
I/O for eMMC should not be turned off. Keep it always on just in case
the eMMC driver fails and doesn't enable it, or unloads and disables it.

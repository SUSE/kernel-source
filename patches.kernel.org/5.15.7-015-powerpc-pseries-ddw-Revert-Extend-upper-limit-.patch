Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries/ddw: Revert "Extend upper limit for huge DMA
 window for persistent memory"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.7
Git-commit: 2d33f5504490a9d90924476dbccd4a5349ee1ad0

[ Upstream commit 2d33f5504490a9d90924476dbccd4a5349ee1ad0 ]

This reverts commit 54fc3c681ded9437e4548e2501dc1136b23cfa9a
which does not allow 1:1 mapping even for the system RAM which
is usually possible.

Subject: [PATCH] net: stmmac: enable HW-accelerated VLAN stripping for gmac4
 only
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.9
Git-commit: 8eb301bd7b0f45d36e663ecbe59b7c80b9863950

[ Upstream commit 8eb301bd7b0f45d36e663ecbe59b7c80b9863950 ]

Commit 750011e239a5 ("net: stmmac: Add support for HW-accelerated VLAN
stripping") enables MAC level VLAN tag stripping for all MAC cores, but
leaves set_hw_vlan_mode() and rx_hw_vlan() un-implemented for both gmac
and xgmac.

On gmac and xgmac, ethtool reports rx-vlan-offload is on, both MAC and
driver do nothing about VLAN packets actually, although VLAN works well.

Driver level stripping should be used on gmac and xgmac for now.

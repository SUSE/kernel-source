Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: flower: Fix wrong handle assignment during filter
 change
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.3
Git-commit: 32eff6bacec2cb574677c15378169a9fa30043ef

[ Upstream commit 32eff6bacec2cb574677c15378169a9fa30043ef ]

Commit 08a0063df3ae ("net/sched: flower: Move filter handle initialization
earlier") moved filter handle initialization but an assignment of
the handle to fnew->handle is done regardless of fold value. This is wrong
because if fold != NULL (so fold->handle == handle) no new handle is
allocated and passed handle is assigned to fnew->handle. Then if any
subsequent action in fl_change() fails then the handle value is
removed from IDR that is incorrect as we will have still valid old filter
instance with handle that is not present in IDR.
Fix this issue by moving the assignment so it is done only when passed
fold == NULL.

Prior the patch:
[root@machine tc-testing]# ./tdc.py -d enp1s0f0np0 -e 14be
Test 14be: Concurrently replace same range of 100k flower filters from 10 tc instances
exit: 123
exit: 0
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
We have an error talking to the kernel
Command failed tmp/replace_6:1885

All test results:

1..1
not ok 1 14be - Concurrently replace same range of 100k flower filters from 10 tc instances
        Command exited with 123, expected 0

After the patch:
[root@machine tc-testing]# ./tdc.py -d enp1s0f0np0 -e 14be
Test 14be: Concurrently replace same range of 100k flower filters from 10 tc instances

All test results:

1..1
ok 1 14be - Concurrently replace same range of 100k flower filters from 10 tc instances

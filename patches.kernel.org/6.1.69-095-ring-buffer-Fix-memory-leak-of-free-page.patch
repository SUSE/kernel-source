Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Fix memory leak of free page
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.69
Git-commit: 17d801758157bec93f26faaf5ff1a8b9a552d67a

commit 17d801758157bec93f26faaf5ff1a8b9a552d67a upstream.

Reading the ring buffer does a swap of a sub-buffer within the ring buffer
with a empty sub-buffer. This allows the reader to have full access to the
content of the sub-buffer that was swapped out without having to worry
about contention with the writer.

The readers call ring_buffer_alloc_read_page() to allocate a page that
will be used to swap with the ring buffer. When the code is finished with
the reader page, it calls ring_buffer_free_read_page(). Instead of freeing
the page, it stores it as a spare. Then next call to
ring_buffer_alloc_read_page() will return this spare instead of calling
into the memory management system to allocate a new page.

Unfortunately, on freeing of the ring buffer, this spare page is not
freed, and causes a memory leak.

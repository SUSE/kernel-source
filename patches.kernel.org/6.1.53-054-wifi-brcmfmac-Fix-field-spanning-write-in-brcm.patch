Subject: [PATCH] wifi: brcmfmac: Fix field-spanning write in
 brcmf_scan_params_v2_to_v1()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: 16e455a465fca91907af0108f3d013150386df30

[ Upstream commit 16e455a465fca91907af0108f3d013150386df30 ]

Using brcmfmac with 6.5-rc3 on a brcmfmac43241b4-sdio triggers
a backtrace caused by the following field-spanning warning:

memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 120) of single field
  "&params_le->channel_list[0]" at
  drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c:1072 (size 2)

The driver still works after this warning. The warning was introduced by the
new field-spanning write checks which were enabled recently.

Fix this by replacing the channel_list[1] declaration at the end of
the struct with a flexible array declaration.

Most users of struct brcmf_scan_params_le calculate the size to alloc
using the size of the non flex-array part of the struct + needed extra
space, so they do not care about sizeof(struct brcmf_scan_params_le).

brcmf_notify_escan_complete() however uses the struct on the stack,
expecting there to be room for at least 1 entry in the channel-list
to store the special -1 abort channel-id.

To make this work use an anonymous union with a padding member
added + the actual channel_list flexible array.

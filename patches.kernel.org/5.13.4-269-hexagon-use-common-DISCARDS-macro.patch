Subject: [PATCH] hexagon: use common DISCARDS macro
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: 681ba73c72302214686401e707e2087ed11a6556

[ Upstream commit 681ba73c72302214686401e707e2087ed11a6556 ]

ld.lld warns that the '.modinfo' section is not currently handled:

ld.lld: warning: kernel/built-in.a(workqueue.o):(.modinfo) is being placed in '.modinfo'
ld.lld: warning: kernel/built-in.a(printk/printk.o):(.modinfo) is being placed in '.modinfo'
ld.lld: warning: kernel/built-in.a(irq/spurious.o):(.modinfo) is being placed in '.modinfo'
ld.lld: warning: kernel/built-in.a(rcu/update.o):(.modinfo) is being placed in '.modinfo'

The '.modinfo' section was added in commit 898490c010b5 ("moduleparam:
Save information about built-in modules in separate file") to the DISCARDS
macro but Hexagon has never used that macro.  The unification of DISCARDS
happened in commit 023bf6f1b8bf ("linker script: unify usage of discard
definition") in 2009, prior to Hexagon being added in 2011.

Switch Hexagon over to the DISCARDS macro so that anything that is
expected to be discarded gets discarded.

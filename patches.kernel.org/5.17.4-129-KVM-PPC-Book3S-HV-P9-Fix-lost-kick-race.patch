Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Fix "lost kick" race
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.4
Git-commit: c7fa848ff01dad9ed3146a6b1a7d3622131bcedd

[ Upstream commit c7fa848ff01dad9ed3146a6b1a7d3622131bcedd ]

When new work is created that requires attention from the hypervisor
(e.g., to inject an interrupt into the guest), fast_vcpu_kick is used to
pull the target vcpu out of the guest if it may have been running.

Therefore the work creation side looks like this:

  vcpu->arch.doorbell_request = 1;
  kvmppc_fast_vcpu_kick_hv(vcpu) {
    smp_mb();
    cpu = vcpu->cpu;
    if (cpu != -1)
        send_ipi(cpu);
  }

And the guest entry side *should* look like this:

  vcpu->cpu = smp_processor_id();
  smp_mb();
  if (vcpu->arch.doorbell_request) {
    // do something (abort entry or inject doorbell etc)
  }

But currently the store and load are flipped, so it is possible for the
entry to see no doorbell pending, and the doorbell creation misses the
store to set cpu, resulting lost work (or at least delayed until the
next guest exit).

Fix this by reordering the entry operations and adding a smp_mb
between them. The P8 path appears to have a similar race which is
commented but not addressed yet.

Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/sifive-plic: Fix syscore registration for
 multi-socket systems
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.2
Git-commit: f99b926f6543faeadba1b4524d8dc9c102489135

[ Upstream commit f99b926f6543faeadba1b4524d8dc9c102489135 ]

Multi-socket systems have a separate PLIC in each socket, so __plic_init()
is invoked for each PLIC. __plic_init() registers syscore operations, which
obviously fails on the second invocation.

Move it into the already existing condition for installing the CPU hotplug
state so it is only invoked once when the first PLIC is initialized.

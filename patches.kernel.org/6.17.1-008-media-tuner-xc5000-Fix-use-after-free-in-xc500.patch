Subject: [PATCH] media: tuner: xc5000: Fix use-after-free in xc5000_release
References: bsc#1012628 CVE-2025-39994 bsc#1252072
Patch-mainline: 6.17.1
Git-commit: 40b7a19f321e65789612ebaca966472055dab48c

commit 40b7a19f321e65789612ebaca966472055dab48c upstream.

The original code uses cancel_delayed_work() in xc5000_release(), which
does not guarantee that the delayed work item timer_sleep has fully
completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free scenarios
where xc5000_release() may free the xc5000_priv while timer_sleep is still
active and attempts to dereference the xc5000_priv.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (release thread)                 | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
xc5000_release()                       | xc5000_do_timer_sleep()
  cancel_delayed_work()                |
  hybrid_tuner_release_state(priv)     |
    kfree(priv)                        |
                                       |   priv = container_of() // UAF

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the timer_sleep is properly canceled before the xc5000_priv memory
is deallocated.

A deadlock concern was considered: xc5000_release() is called in a process
context and is not holding any locks that the timer_sleep work item might
also need. Therefore, the use of the _sync() variant is safe here.

This bug was initially identified through static analysis.

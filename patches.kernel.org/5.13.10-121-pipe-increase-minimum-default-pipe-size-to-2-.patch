Subject: [PATCH] pipe: increase minimum default pipe size to 2 pages
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.10
Git-commit: 46c4c9d1beb7f5b4cec4dd90e7728720583ee348

commit 46c4c9d1beb7f5b4cec4dd90e7728720583ee348 upstream.

This program always prints 4096 and hangs before the patch, and always
prints 8192 and exits successfully after:

  int main()
  {
      int pipefd[2];
      for (int i = 0; i < 1025; i++)
          if (pipe(pipefd) == -1)
              return 1;
      size_t bufsz = fcntl(pipefd[1], F_GETPIPE_SZ);
      printf("%zd\n", bufsz);
      char *buf = calloc(bufsz, 1);
      write(pipefd[1], buf, bufsz);
      read(pipefd[0], buf, bufsz-1);
      write(pipefd[1], buf, 1);
  }

Note that you may need to increase your RLIMIT_NOFILE before running the
program.

Fixes: 759c01142a ("pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes")

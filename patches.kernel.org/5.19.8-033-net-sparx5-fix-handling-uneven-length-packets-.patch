Subject: [PATCH] net: sparx5: fix handling uneven length packets in manual
 extraction
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.8
Git-commit: 7498a457ecf7ff2c4d379360aa8f24566bb1543e

[ Upstream commit 7498a457ecf7ff2c4d379360aa8f24566bb1543e ]

Packets that are not of length divisible by 4 (e.g. 77, 78, 79) would
have the checksum included up to next multiple of 4 (a 77 bytes packet
would have 3 bytes of ethernet checksum included). The check for the
value expects it in host (Little) endian.

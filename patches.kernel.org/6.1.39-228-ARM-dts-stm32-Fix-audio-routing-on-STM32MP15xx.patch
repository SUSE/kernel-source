Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: Fix audio routing on STM32MP15xx DHCOM PDK2
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: e3f2778b1b6ced649bffdc7cbb05b80bb92f2108

[ Upstream commit e3f2778b1b6ced649bffdc7cbb05b80bb92f2108 ]

The audio routing flow is not correct, the flow should be from source
(second element in the pair) to sink (first element in the pair). The
flow now is from "HP_OUT" to "Playback", where "Playback" is source
and "HP_OUT" is sink, i.e. the direction is swapped and there is no
direct link between the two either.

Fill in the correct routing, where "HP_OUT" supplies the "Headphone Jack",
"Line In Jack" supplies "LINE_IN" input, "Microphone Jack" supplies "MIC_IN"
input and "Mic Bias" supplies "Microphone Jack".

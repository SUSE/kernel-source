Subject: [PATCH] riscv: use lw when reading int cpu in asm_per_cpu
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.6
Git-commit: f4ea67a722e8c9e1fb8109adebb9fb881ff0793a

commit f4ea67a722e8c9e1fb8109adebb9fb881ff0793a upstream.

REG_L is wrong, because thread_info.cpu is 32-bit, not xlen-bit wide.
The struct currently has a hole after cpu, so little endian accesses
seemed fine.

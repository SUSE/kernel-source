Subject: [PATCH] SUNRPC: prevent port reuse on transports which don't request
 it.
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: bc1c56e9bbe92766d017efb5f0a0c71f80da5570

[ Upstream commit bc1c56e9bbe92766d017efb5f0a0c71f80da5570 ]

If an RPC client is created without RPC_CLNT_CREATE_REUSEPORT, it should
not reuse the source port when a TCP connection is re-established.
This is currently implemented by preventing the source port being
recorded after a successful connection (the call to xs_set_srcport()).

However the source port is also recorded after a successful bind in xs_bind().
This may not be needed at all and certainly is not wanted when
RPC_CLNT_CREATE_REUSEPORT wasn't requested.

So avoid that assignment when xprt.reuseport is not set.

With this change, NFSv4.1 and later mounts use a different port number on
each connection.  This is helpful with some firewalls which don't cope
well with port reuse.

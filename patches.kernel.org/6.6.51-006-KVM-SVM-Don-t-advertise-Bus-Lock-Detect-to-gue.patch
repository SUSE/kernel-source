Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Don't advertise Bus Lock Detect to guest if SVM
 support is missing
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.51
Git-commit: 54950bfe2b69cdc06ef753872b5225e54eb73506

commit 54950bfe2b69cdc06ef753872b5225e54eb73506 upstream.

If host supports Bus Lock Detect, KVM advertises it to guests even if
SVM support is absent. Additionally, guest wouldn't be able to use it
despite guest CPUID bit being set. Fix it by unconditionally clearing
the feature bit in KVM cpu capability.

Subject: [PATCH] block: update the stable_writes flag in bdev_add
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.4
Git-commit: 1898efcdbed32bb1c67269c985a50bab0dbc9493

[ Upstream commit 1898efcdbed32bb1c67269c985a50bab0dbc9493 ]

Propagate the per-queue stable_write flags into each bdev inode in bdev_add.
This makes sure devices that require stable writes have it set for I/O
on the block device node as well.

Note that this doesn't cover the case of a flag changing on a live device
yet.  We should handle that as well, but I plan to cover it as part of a
more general rework of how changing runtime paramters on block devices
works.

Fixes: 1cb039f3dc16 ("bdi: replace BDI_CAP_STABLE_WRITES with a queue and a sb flag")

Subject: [PATCH] arm64/fpsimd: Avoid erroneous elide of user state reload
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: e92bee9f861b466c676f0200be3e46af7bc4ac6b

commit e92bee9f861b466c676f0200be3e46af7bc4ac6b upstream.

TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is a 'convenience' flag that should reflect whether
the current CPU holds the most recent user mode FP/SIMD state of the
current task. It combines two conditions:
- whether the current CPU's FP/SIMD state belongs to the task;
- whether that state is the most recent associated with the task (as a
  task may have executed on other CPUs as well).

When a task is scheduled in and TIF_KERNEL_FPSTATE is set, it means the
task was in a kernel mode NEON section when it was scheduled out, and so
the kernel mode FP/SIMD state is restored. Since this implies that the
current CPU is *not* holding the most recent user mode FP/SIMD state of
the current task, the TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag is set too, so that the
user mode FP/SIMD state is reloaded from memory when returning to
userland.

However, the task may be scheduled out after completing the kernel mode
NEON section, but before returning to userland. When this happens, the
TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag will not be preserved, but will be set as usual
the next time the task is scheduled in, and will be based on the above
conditions.

This means that, rather than setting TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE when scheduling
in a task with TIF_KERNEL_FPSTATE set, the underlying state should be
updated so that TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE will assume the expected value as a
result.

So instead, call fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), which takes care of this.

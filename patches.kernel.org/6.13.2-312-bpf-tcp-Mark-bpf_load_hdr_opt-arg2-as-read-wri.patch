Subject: [PATCH] bpf: tcp: Mark bpf_load_hdr_opt() arg2 as read-write
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: 8ac412a3361173e3000b16167af3d1f6f90af613

[ Upstream commit 8ac412a3361173e3000b16167af3d1f6f90af613 ]

MEM_WRITE attribute is defined as: "Non-presence of MEM_WRITE means that
MEM is only being read". bpf_load_hdr_opt() both reads and writes from
its arg2 - void *search_res.

This matters a lot for the next commit where we more precisely track
stack accesses. Without this annotation, the verifier will make false
assumptions about the contents of memory written to by helpers and
possibly prune valid branches.

Fixes: 6fad274f06f0 ("bpf: Add MEM_WRITE attribute")

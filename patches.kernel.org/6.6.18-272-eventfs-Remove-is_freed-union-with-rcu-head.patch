Subject: [PATCH] eventfs: Remove "is_freed" union with rcu head
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.18
Git-commit: f2f496370afcbc5227d7002da28c74b91fed12ff

commit f2f496370afcbc5227d7002da28c74b91fed12ff upstream.

The eventfs_inode->is_freed was a union with the rcu_head with the
assumption that when it was on the srcu list the head would contain a
pointer which would make "is_freed" true. But that was a wrong assumption
as the rcu head is a single link list where the last element is NULL.

Instead, split the nr_entries integer so that "is_freed" is one bit and
the nr_entries is the next 31 bits. As there shouldn't be more than 10
(currently there's at most 5 to 7 depending on the config), this should
not be a problem.

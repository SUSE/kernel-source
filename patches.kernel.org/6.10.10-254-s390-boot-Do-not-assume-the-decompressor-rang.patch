Subject: [PATCH] s390/boot: Do not assume the decompressor range is reserved
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.10
Git-commit: b798b685b42c9dbe508e59a74250d97c41bec35e

[ Upstream commit b798b685b42c9dbe508e59a74250d97c41bec35e ]

When allocating a random memory range for .amode31 sections
the minimal randomization address is 0. That does not lead
to a possible overlap with the decompressor image (which also
starts from 0) since by that time the image range is already
reserved.

Do not assume the decompressor range is reserved and always
provide the minimal randomization address for .amode31
sections beyond the decompressor. That is a prerequisite
for moving the lowcore memory address from NULL elsewhere.

Subject: [PATCH] hugetlb: clear huge pte during flush function on mips
 platform
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.3
Git-commit: 33ae8f801ad8bec48e886d368739feb2816478f2

[ Upstream commit 33ae8f801ad8bec48e886d368739feb2816478f2 ]

If multiple threads are accessing the same huge page at the same
time, hugetlb_cow will be called if one thread write the COW huge
page. And function huge_ptep_clear_flush is called to notify other
threads to clear the huge pte tlb entry. The other threads clear
the huge pte tlb entry and reload it from page table, the reload
huge pte entry may be old.

This patch fixes this issue on mips platform, and it clears huge
pte entry before notifying other threads to flush current huge
page entry, it is similar with other architectures.

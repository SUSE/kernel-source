Subject: [PATCH] spi: Reintroduce spi_set_cs_timing()
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.71
Git-commit: 684a47847ae639689e7b823251975348a8e5434f

[ Upstream commit 684a47847ae639689e7b823251975348a8e5434f ]

commit 4ccf359849ce ("spi: remove spi_set_cs_timing()"), removed the
method as noboby used it. Nobody used it probably because some SPI
controllers use some default large cs-setup time that covers the usual
cs-setup time required by the spi devices. There are though SPI controllers
that have a smaller granularity for the cs-setup time and their default
value can't fulfill the spi device requirements. That's the case for the
at91 QSPI IPs where the default cs-setup time is half of the QSPI clock
period. This was observed when using an sst26vf064b SPI NOR flash which
needs a spi-cs-setup-ns = <7>; in order to be operated close to its maximum
104 MHz frequency.

Call spi_set_cs_timing() in spi_setup() just before calling spi_set_cs(),
as the latter needs the CS timings already set.
If spi->controller->set_cs_timing is not set, the method will return 0.
There's no functional impact expected for the existing drivers. Even if the
spi-mt65xx.c and spi-tegra114.c drivers set the set_cs_timing method,
there's no user for them as of now. The only tested user of this support
will be a SPI NOR flash that comunicates with the Atmel QSPI controller for
which the support follows in the next patches.

One will notice that this support is a bit different from the one that was
removed in commit 4ccf359849ce ("spi: remove spi_set_cs_timing()"),
because this patch adapts to the changes done after the removal: the move
of the cs delays to the spi device, the retirement of the lelgacy GPIO
handling. The mutex handling was removed from spi_set_cs_timing() because
we now always call spi_set_cs_timing() in spi_setup(), which already
handles the spi->controller->io_mutex, so use the mutex handling from
spi_setup().

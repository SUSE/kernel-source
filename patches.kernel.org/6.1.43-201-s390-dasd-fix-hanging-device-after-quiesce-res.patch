Subject: [PATCH] s390/dasd: fix hanging device after quiesce/resume
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.43
Git-commit: 05f1d8ed03f547054efbc4d29bb7991c958ede95

commit 05f1d8ed03f547054efbc4d29bb7991c958ede95 upstream.

Quiesce and resume are functions that tell the DASD driver to stop/resume
issuing I/Os to a specific DASD.

On resume dasd_schedule_block_bh() is called to kick handling of IO
requests again. This does unfortunately not cover internal requests which
are used for path verification for example.

This could lead to a hanging device when a path event or anything else
that triggers internal requests occurs on a quiesced device.

Fix by also calling dasd_schedule_device_bh() which triggers handling of
internal requests on resume.

Fixes: 8e09f21574ea ("[S390] dasd: add hyper PAV support to DASD device driver, part 1")

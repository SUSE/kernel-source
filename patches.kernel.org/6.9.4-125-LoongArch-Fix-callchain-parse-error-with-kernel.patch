Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: Fix callchain parse error with kernel tracepoint
 events again
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.4
Git-commit: d6af2c76399f98444a5b4de96baf4b362d9f102b

[ Upstream commit d6af2c76399f98444a5b4de96baf4b362d9f102b ]

With commit d3119bc985fb645 ("LoongArch: Fix callchain parse error with
kernel tracepoint events"), perf can parse kernel callchain, but not
complete and sometimes maybe error. The reason is LoongArch's unwinders
(guess, prologue and orc) don't really need fp (i.e., regs[22]), and
they use sp (i.e., regs[3]) as the frame address rather than the current
stack pointer.

Fix that by removing the assignment of regs[22], and instead assign the
__builtin_frame_address(0) to regs[3].

Without fix:

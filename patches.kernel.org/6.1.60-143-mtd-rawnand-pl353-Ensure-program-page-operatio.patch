Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: pl353: Ensure program page operations are
 successful
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.60
Git-commit: 9777cc13fd2c3212618904636354be60835e10bb

commit 9777cc13fd2c3212618904636354be60835e10bb upstream.

The NAND core complies with the ONFI specification, which itself
mentions that after any program or erase operation, a status check
should be performed to see whether the operation was finished *and*
successful.

The NAND core offers helpers to finish a page write (sending the
"PAGE PROG" command, waiting for the NAND chip to be ready again, and
checking the operation status). But in some cases, advanced controller
drivers might want to optimize this and craft their own page write
helper to leverage additional hardware capabilities, thus not always
using the core facilities.

Some drivers, like this one, do not use the core helper to finish a page
write because the final cycles are automatically managed by the
hardware. In this case, the additional care must be taken to manually
perform the final status check.

Let's read the NAND chip status at the end of the page write helper and
return -EIO upon error.

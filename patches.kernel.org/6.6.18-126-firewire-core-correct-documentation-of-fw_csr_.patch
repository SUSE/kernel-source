Subject: [PATCH] firewire: core: correct documentation of fw_csr_string()
 kernel API
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.18
Git-commit: 5f9ab17394f831cb7986ec50900fa37507a127f1

commit 5f9ab17394f831cb7986ec50900fa37507a127f1 upstream.

Against its current description, the kernel API can accepts all types of
directory entries.

This commit corrects the documentation.

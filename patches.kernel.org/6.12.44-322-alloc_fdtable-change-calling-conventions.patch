Subject: [PATCH] alloc_fdtable(): change calling conventions.
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.44
Git-commit: 1d3b4bec3ce55e0c46cdce7d0402dbd6b4af3a3d

[ Upstream commit 1d3b4bec3ce55e0c46cdce7d0402dbd6b4af3a3d ]

First of all, tell it how many slots do we want, not which slot
is wanted.  It makes one caller (dup_fd()) more straightforward
and doesn't harm another (expand_fdtable()).

Furthermore, make it return ERR_PTR() on failure rather than
returning NULL.  Simplifies the callers.

Simplify the size calculation, while we are at it - note that we
always have slots_wanted greater than BITS_PER_LONG.  What the
rules boil down to is
	* use the smallest power of two large enough to give us
that many slots
	* on 32bit skip 64 and 128 - the minimal capacity we want
there is 256 slots (i.e. 1Kb fd array).
	* on 64bit don't skip anything, the minimal capacity is
128 - and we'll never be asked for 64 or less.  128 slots means
1Kb fd array, again.
	* on 128bit, if that ever happens, don't skip anything -
we'll never be asked for 128 or less, so the fd array allocation
will be at least 2Kb.

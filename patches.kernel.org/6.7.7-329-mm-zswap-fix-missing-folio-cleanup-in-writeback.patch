Subject: [PATCH] mm: zswap: fix missing folio cleanup in writeback race path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: e3b63e966cac0bf78aaa1efede1827a252815a1d

commit e3b63e966cac0bf78aaa1efede1827a252815a1d upstream.

In zswap_writeback_entry(), after we get a folio from
__read_swap_cache_async(), we grab the tree lock again to check that the
swap entry was not invalidated and recycled.  If it was, we delete the
folio we just added to the swap cache and exit.

However, __read_swap_cache_async() returns the folio locked when it is
newly allocated, which is always true for this path, and the folio is
ref'd.  Make sure to unlock and put the folio before returning.

This was discovered by code inspection, probably because this path handles
a race condition that should not happen often, and the bug would not crash
the system, it will only strand the folio indefinitely.

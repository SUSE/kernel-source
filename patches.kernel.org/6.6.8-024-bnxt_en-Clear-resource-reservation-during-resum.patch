Subject: [PATCH] bnxt_en: Clear resource reservation during resume
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.8
Git-commit: 9ef7c58f5abe41e6d91f37f28fe2d851ffedd92a

[ Upstream commit 9ef7c58f5abe41e6d91f37f28fe2d851ffedd92a ]

We are issuing HWRM_FUNC_RESET cmd to reset the device including
all reserved resources, but not clearing the reservations
within the driver struct. As a result, when the driver re-initializes
as part of resume, it believes that there is no need to do any
resource reservation and goes ahead and tries to allocate rings
which will eventually fail beyond a certain number pre-reserved by
the firmware.

Fixes: 674f50a5b026 ("bnxt_en: Implement new method to reserve rings.")

Subject: [PATCH] firmware: qcom_scm: use 64-bit calling convention only when
 client is 64-bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.3
Git-commit: 3337a6fea25370d3d244ec6bb38c71ee86fcf837

commit 3337a6fea25370d3d244ec6bb38c71ee86fcf837 upstream.

Per the "SMC calling convention specification", the 64-bit calling
convention can only be used when the client is 64-bit. Whereas the
32-bit calling convention can be used by either a 32-bit or a 64-bit
client.

Currently during SCM probe, irrespective of the client, 64-bit calling
convention is made, which is incorrect and may lead to the undefined
behaviour when the client is 32-bit. Let's fix it.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix scan abort handling with HW rfkill
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.42
Git-commit: e6dd2936ce7ce94a1915b799f8af8193ec628e87

[ Upstream commit e6dd2936ce7ce94a1915b799f8af8193ec628e87 ]

When HW rfkill is toggled to disable the RF, the flow to stop scan is
called. When trying to send the command to abort the scan, since
HW rfkill is toggled, the command is not sent due to rfkill being
asserted, and -ERFKILL is returned from iwl_trans_send_cmd(), but this
is silently ignored in iwl_mvm_send_cmd() and thus the scan abort flow
continues to wait for scan complete notification and fails. Since it
fails, the UID to type mapping is not cleared, and thus a warning is
later fired when trying to stop the interface.

To fix this, modify the UMAC scan abort flow to force sending the
scan abort command even when in rfkill, so stop the FW from accessing
the radio etc.

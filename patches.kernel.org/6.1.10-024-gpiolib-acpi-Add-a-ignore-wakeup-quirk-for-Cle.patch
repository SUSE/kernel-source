Subject: [PATCH] gpiolib: acpi: Add a ignore wakeup quirk for Clevo NL5xRU
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.10
Git-commit: 4cb786180dfb5258ff3111181b5e4ecb1d4a297b

[ Upstream commit 4cb786180dfb5258ff3111181b5e4ecb1d4a297b ]

commit 1796f808e4bb ("HID: i2c-hid: acpi: Stop setting wakeup_capable")
changed the policy such that I2C touchpads may be able to wake up the
system by default if the system is configured as such.

However on Clevo NL5xRU there is a mistake in the ACPI tables that the
TP_ATTN# signal connected to GPIO 9 is configured as ActiveLow and level
triggered but connected to a pull up. As soon as the system suspends the
touchpad loses power and then the system wakes up.

To avoid this problem, introduce a quirk for this model that will prevent
the wakeup capability for being set for GPIO 9.

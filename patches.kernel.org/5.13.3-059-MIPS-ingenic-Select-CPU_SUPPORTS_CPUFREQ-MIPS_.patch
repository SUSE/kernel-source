Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: ingenic: Select CPU_SUPPORTS_CPUFREQ &&
 MIPS_EXTERNAL_TIMER
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.3
Git-commit: eb3849370ae32b571e1f9a63ba52c61adeaf88f7

[ Upstream commit eb3849370ae32b571e1f9a63ba52c61adeaf88f7 ]

The clock driving the XBurst CPUs in Ingenic SoCs is integer divided
from the main PLL. As such, it is possible to control the frequency of
the CPU, either by changing the divider, or by changing the rate of the
main PLL.

The XBurst CPUs also lack the CP0 timer; the TCU, a separate piece of
hardware in the SoC, provides this functionality.

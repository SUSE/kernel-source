Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: samsung-dsim: Set P divider based on min/max of
 fin pll
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 78c4c0011bb577a29906d8ca135795af2293c49e

[ Upstream commit 78c4c0011bb577a29906d8ca135795af2293c49e ]

The P divider should be set based on the min and max values of
the fin pll which may vary between different platforms.
These ranges are defined per platform, but hard-coded values
were used instead which resulted in a smaller range available
on the i.MX8M[MNP] than what was possible.

As noted by Frieder, there are descripencies between the reference
manuals of the Mini, Nano and Plus, so I reached out to my NXP
rep and got the following response regarding the varing notes
in the documentation.

"Yes it is definitely wrong, the one that is part of the NOTE in
MIPI_DPHY_M_PLLPMS register table against PMS_P, PMS_M and PMS_S is
not correct. I will report this to Doc team, the one customer should
be take into account is the Table 13-40 DPHY PLL Parameters and the
Note above."

With this patch, the clock rates now match the values used in NXP's
downstream kernel.

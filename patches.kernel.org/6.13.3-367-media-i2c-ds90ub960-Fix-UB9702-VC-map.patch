Subject: [PATCH] media: i2c: ds90ub960: Fix UB9702 VC map
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: 5dbbd0609b83f6eb72c005e2e5979d0cd25243c8

commit 5dbbd0609b83f6eb72c005e2e5979d0cd25243c8 upstream.

The driver uses a static CSI-2 virtual channel mapping where all virtual
channels from an RX port are mapped to a virtual channel number matching
the RX port number.

The UB960 and UB9702 have different registers for the purpose, and the
UB9702 version is not correct. Each of the VC_ID_MAP registers do not
contain a single mapping, as the driver currently thinks, but two.

This can cause received VCs other than 0 to be mapped in a wrong way.

Fix this by writing both mappings to each register.

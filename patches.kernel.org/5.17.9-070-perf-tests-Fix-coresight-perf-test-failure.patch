Subject: [PATCH] perf tests: Fix coresight `perf test` failure.
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.9
Git-commit: 45fa7c38696bae632310c2876ba81fdfa25cc9c2

[ Upstream commit 45fa7c38696bae632310c2876ba81fdfa25cc9c2 ]

Currently the `perf test` always fails the coresight test like:

  89: Check Arm CoreSight trace data recording and synthesized samples: FAILED!

That is because the test_arm_coresight.sh is attempting to SIGINT the
parent but is using $$ rather than $PPID and it sigint's itself when
run under the perf test framework.

Since this is done in a trap clause it ends up returning a non zero
return.

Since $PPID is a bash ism and not all distros are linking /bin/sh to
bash, the alternative parent pid lookups are uglier than just dropping
the kill, and its not strictly needed, lets pick the simple solution and
drop the sigint.

Subject: [PATCH] xen/blkfront: Only check REQ_FUA for writes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.9
Git-commit: b6ebaa8100090092aa602530d7e8316816d0c98d

[ Upstream commit b6ebaa8100090092aa602530d7e8316816d0c98d ]

The existing code silently converts read operations with the
REQ_FUA bit set into write-barrier operations. This results in data
loss as the backend scribbles zeroes over the data instead of returning
it.

While the REQ_FUA bit doesn't make sense on a read operation, at least
one well-known out-of-tree kernel module does set it and since it
results in data loss, let's be safe here and only look at REQ_FUA for
writes.

Subject: [PATCH] can: dev: can_restart(): don't crash kernel if carrier is OK
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.63
Git-commit: fe5c9940dfd8ba0c73672dddb30acd1b7a11d4c7

[ Upstream commit fe5c9940dfd8ba0c73672dddb30acd1b7a11d4c7 ]

During testing, I triggered a can_restart() with the netif carrier
being OK [1]. The BUG_ON, which checks if the carrier is OK, results
in a fatal kernel crash. This is neither helpful for debugging nor for
a production system.

[1] The root cause is a race condition in can_restart() which will be
fixed in the next patch.

Do not crash the kernel, issue an error message instead, and continue
restarting the CAN device anyway.

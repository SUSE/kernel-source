Subject: [PATCH] nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked
 flag
References: bsc#1012628 CVE-2024-50230 bsc#1233206
Patch-mainline: 6.11.7
Git-commit: 41e192ad2779cae0102879612dfe46726e4396aa

commit 41e192ad2779cae0102879612dfe46726e4396aa upstream.

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the "checked" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was
applied to more than just metadata files.

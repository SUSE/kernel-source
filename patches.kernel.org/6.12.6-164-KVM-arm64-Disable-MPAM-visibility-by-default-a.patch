Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Disable MPAM visibility by default and ignore VMM
 writes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.6
Git-commit: 6685f5d572c22e1003e7c0d089afe1c64340ab1f

commit 6685f5d572c22e1003e7c0d089afe1c64340ab1f upstream.

commit 011e5f5bf529f ("arm64/cpufeature: Add remaining feature bits in
ID_AA64PFR0 register") exposed the MPAM field of AA64PFR0_EL1 to guests,
but didn't add trap handling. A previous patch supplied the missing trap
handling.

Existing VMs that have the MPAM field of ID_AA64PFR0_EL1 set need to
be migratable, but there is little point enabling the MPAM CPU
interface on new VMs until there is something a guest can do with it.

Clear the MPAM field from the guest's ID_AA64PFR0_EL1 and on hardware
that supports MPAM, politely ignore the VMMs attempts to set this bit.

Guests exposed to this bug have the sanitised value of the MPAM field,
so only the correct value needs to be ignored. This means the field
can continue to be used to block migration to incompatible hardware
(between MPAM=1 and MPAM=5), and the VMM can't rely on the field
being ignored.

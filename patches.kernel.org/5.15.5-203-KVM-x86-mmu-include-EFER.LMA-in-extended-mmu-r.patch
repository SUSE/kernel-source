Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/mmu: include EFER.LMA in extended mmu role
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.5
Git-commit: b8453cdcf26020030da182f0156d7bf59ae5719f

commit b8453cdcf26020030da182f0156d7bf59ae5719f upstream.

Incorporate EFER.LMA into kvm_mmu_extended_role, as it used to compute the
guest root level and is not reflected in kvm_mmu_page_role.level when TDP
is in use.  When simply running the guest, it is impossible for EFER.LMA
and kvm_mmu.root_level to get out of sync, as the guest cannot transition
from PAE paging to 64-bit paging without toggling CR0.PG, i.e. without
first bouncing through a different MMU context.  And stuffing guest state
via KVM_SET_SREGS{,2} also ensures a full MMU context reset.

However, if KVM_SET_SREGS{,2} is followed by KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE, e.g. to
set guest state when migrating the VM while L2 is active, the vCPU state
will reflect L2, not L1.  If L1 is using TDP for L2, then root_mmu will
have been configured using L2's state, despite not being used for L2.  If
L2.EFER.LMA != L1.EFER.LMA, and L2 is using PAE paging, then root_mmu will
be configured for guest PAE paging, but will match the mmu_role for 64-bit
paging and cause KVM to not reconfigure root_mmu on the next nested VM-Exit.

Alternatively, the root_mmu's role could be invalidated after a successful
KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE that yields vcpu->arch.mmu != vcpu->arch.root_mmu,
i.e. that switches the active mmu to guest_mmu, but doing so is unnecessarily
tricky, and not even needed if L1 and L2 do have the same role (e.g., they
are both 64-bit guests and run with the same CR4).

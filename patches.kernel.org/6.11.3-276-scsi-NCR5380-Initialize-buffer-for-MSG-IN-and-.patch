Subject: [PATCH] scsi: NCR5380: Initialize buffer for MSG IN and STATUS
 transfers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.3
Git-commit: 1c71065df2df693d208dd32758171c1dece66341

[ Upstream commit 1c71065df2df693d208dd32758171c1dece66341 ]

Following an incomplete transfer in MSG IN phase, the driver would not
notice the problem and would make use of invalid data. Initialize 'tmp'
appropriately and bail out if no message was received. For STATUS phase,
preserve the existing status code unless a new value was transferred.

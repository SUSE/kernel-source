Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: update comment for struct btrfs_inode::lock
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.54
Git-commit: 68539bd0e73b457f88a9d00cabb6533ec8582dc9

[ Upstream commit 68539bd0e73b457f88a9d00cabb6533ec8582dc9 ]

Update the comment for the lock named "lock" in struct btrfs_inode because
it does not mention that the fields "delalloc_bytes", "defrag_bytes",
"csum_bytes", "outstanding_extents" and "disk_i_size" are also protected
by that lock.

Also add a comment on top of each field protected by this lock to mention
that the lock protects them.

Subject: [PATCH] mm: prep_compound_tail() clear page->private
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.7
Git-commit: 5aae9265ee1a30cf716d6caf6b29fe99b9d55130

commit 5aae9265ee1a30cf716d6caf6b29fe99b9d55130 upstream.

Although page allocation always clears page->private in the first page or
head page of an allocation, it has never made a point of clearing
page->private in the tails (though 0 is often what is already there).

But now commit 71e2d666ef85 ("mm/huge_memory: do not clobber swp_entry_t
during THP split") issues a warning when page_tail->private is found to be
non-0 (unless it's swapcache).

Change that warning to dump page_tail (which also dumps head), instead of
just the head: so far we have seen dead000000000122, dead000000000003,
dead000000000001 or 0000000000000002 in the raw output for tail private.

We could just delete the warning, but today's consensus appears to want
page->private to be 0, unless there's a good reason for it to be set: so
now clear it in prep_compound_tail() (more general than just for THP; but
not for high order allocation, which makes no pass down the tails).

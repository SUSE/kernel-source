Subject: [PATCH] selftests/ftrace: Fix eventfs ownership testcase to find
 mount point
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.2
Git-commit: f0a6ecebd858658df213d114b0530f8f0b96e396

[ Upstream commit f0a6ecebd858658df213d114b0530f8f0b96e396 ]

Fix eventfs ownership testcase to find mount point if stat -c "%m" failed.
This can happen on the system based on busybox. In this case, this will
try to use the current working directory, which should be a tracefs top
directory (and eventfs is mounted as a part of tracefs.)
If it does not work, the test is skipped as UNRESOLVED because of
the environmental problem.

Fixes: ee9793be08b1 ("tracing/selftests: Add ownership modification tests for eventfs")

Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: KVM: Fix GPA size issue about VM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.7
Git-commit: 6bdbb73dc8d99fbb77f5db79dbb6f108708090b4

commit 6bdbb73dc8d99fbb77f5db79dbb6f108708090b4 upstream.

Physical address space is 48 bit on Loongson-3A5000 physical machine,
however it is 47 bit for VM on Loongson-3A5000 system. Size of physical
address space of VM is the same with the size of virtual user space (a
half) of physical machine.

Variable cpu_vabits represents user address space, kernel address space
is not included (user space and kernel space are both a half of total).
Here cpu_vabits, rather than cpu_vabits - 1, is to represent the size of
guest physical address space.

Also there is strict checking about page fault GPA address, inject error
if it is larger than maximum GPA address of VM.

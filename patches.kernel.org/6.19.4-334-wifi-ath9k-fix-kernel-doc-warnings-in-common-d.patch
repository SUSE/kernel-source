  may have had errors.
Warning: ../drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/common-debug.h:23 bad line:
  may have had errors.
Warning: ../drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/common-debug.h:26 bad line:
  decryption process completed
Warning: ../drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/common-debug.h:28 bad line:

Fixes: 1395d3f00a41 ("ath9k: Add debugfs file for RX errors")

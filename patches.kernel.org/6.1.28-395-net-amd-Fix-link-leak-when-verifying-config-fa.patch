Subject: [PATCH] net: amd: Fix link leak when verifying config failed
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: d325c34d9e7e38d371c0a299d415e9b07f66a1fb

[ Upstream commit d325c34d9e7e38d371c0a299d415e9b07f66a1fb ]

After failing to verify configuration, it returns directly without
releasing link, which may cause memory leak.

Paolo Abeni thinks that the whole code of this driver is quite
"suboptimal" and looks unmainatained since at least ~15y, so he
suggests that we could simply remove the whole driver, please
take it into consideration.

Simon Horman suggests that the fix label should be set to
"Linux-2.6.12-rc2" considering that the problem has existed
since the driver was introduced and the commit above doesn't
seem to exist in net/net-next.

Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")

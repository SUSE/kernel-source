Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: marvell: cn9132-clearfog: fix multi-lane pci x2
 and x4 ports
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.50
Git-commit: 794a066688038df46c01e177cc6faebded0acba4

commit 794a066688038df46c01e177cc6faebded0acba4 upstream.

The mvebu-comphy driver does not currently know how to pass correct
lane-count to ATF while configuring the serdes lanes.

This causes the system to hard reset during reconfiguration, if a pci
card is present and has established a link during bootloader.

Remove the comphy handles from the respective pci nodes to avoid runtime
reconfiguration, relying solely on bootloader configuration - while
avoiding the hard reset.

When bootloader has configured the lanes correctly, the pci ports are
functional under Linux.

This issue may be addressed in the comphy driver at a future point.

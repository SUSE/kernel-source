Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: msm8226-microsoft-common: Enable smbb
 explicitly
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 81a0a21b6159c6a9ed1e39c23e755cd05a102ce3

[ Upstream commit 81a0a21b6159c6a9ed1e39c23e755cd05a102ce3 ]

Enable the smbb node explicitly for MSM8x26 Lumia devices. These devices
rely on the smbb driver in order to detect USB state.

It seems that this was accidentally missed in the commit that this
fixes.

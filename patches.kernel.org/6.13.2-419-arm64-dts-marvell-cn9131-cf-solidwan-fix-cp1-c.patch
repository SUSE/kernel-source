Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: marvell: cn9131-cf-solidwan: fix cp1 comphy links
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: 09cdb973afa7a18ce8e66807daff94609cc4b8a4

[ Upstream commit 09cdb973afa7a18ce8e66807daff94609cc4b8a4 ]

Marvell CN913x platforms use common phy framework for configuring and
linking serdes lanes according to their usage.
Each CP (X) features 5 serdes lanes (Y) represented by cpX_comphyY
nodes.

CN9131 SolidWAN uses CP1 serdes lanes 3 and 5 for eth1 and eth2 of CP1
respectively. Devicetree however wrongly links from these ports to the
comphy of CP0.

Replace the wrong links to cp0_comphy with cp1_comphy inside cp1_eth1,
cp1_eth2.

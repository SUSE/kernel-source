Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx8mp: Correct thermal sensor index
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.50
Git-commit: a50342f976d25aace73ff551845ce89406f48f35

[ Upstream commit a50342f976d25aace73ff551845ce89406f48f35 ]

The TMU has two temperature measurement sites located on the chip. The
probe 0 is located inside of the ANAMIX, while the probe 1 is located near
the ARM core. This has been confirmed by checking with HW design team and
checking RTL code.

So correct the {cpu,soc}-thermal sensor index.

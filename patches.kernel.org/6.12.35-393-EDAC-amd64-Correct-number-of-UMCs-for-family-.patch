Subject: [PATCH] EDAC/amd64: Correct number of UMCs for family 19h models
 70h-7fh
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.35
Git-commit: b2e673ae53ef4b943f68585207a5f21cfc9a0714

commit b2e673ae53ef4b943f68585207a5f21cfc9a0714 upstream.

AMD's Family 19h-based Models 70h-7fh support 4 unified memory controllers
(UMC) per processor die.

The amd64_edac driver, however, assumes only 2 UMCs are supported since
max_mcs variable for the models has not been explicitly set to 4. The same
results in incomplete or incorrect memory information being logged to dmesg by
the module during initialization in some instances.

Fixes: 6c79e42169fe ("EDAC/amd64: Add support for ECC on family 19h model 60h-7Fh")

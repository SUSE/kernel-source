Subject: [PATCH] net: seg6: fix seg6_lookup_any_nexthop() to handle VRFs using
 flowi_l3mdev
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.4
Git-commit: a3bd2102e464202b58d57390a538d96f57ffc361

[ Upstream commit a3bd2102e464202b58d57390a538d96f57ffc361 ]

Commit 40867d74c374 ("net: Add l3mdev index to flow struct and avoid oif
reset for port devices") adds a new entry (flowi_l3mdev) in the common
flow struct used for indicating the l3mdev index for later rule and
table matching.
The l3mdev_update_flow() has been adapted to properly set the
flowi_l3mdev based on the flowi_oif/flowi_iif. In fact, when a valid
flowi_iif is supplied to the l3mdev_update_flow(), this function can
update the flowi_l3mdev entry only if it has not yet been set (i.e., the
flowi_l3mdev entry is equal to 0).

The SRv6 End.DT6 behavior in VRF mode leverages a VRF device in order to
force the routing lookup into the associated routing table. This routing
operation is performed by seg6_lookup_any_nextop() preparing a flowi6
data structure used by ip6_route_input_lookup() which, in turn,
(indirectly) invokes l3mdev_update_flow().

However, seg6_lookup_any_nexthop() does not initialize the new
flowi_l3mdev entry which is filled with random garbage data. This
prevents l3mdev_update_flow() from properly updating the flowi_l3mdev
with the VRF index, and thus SRv6 End.DT6 (VRF mode)/DT46 behaviors are
broken.

This patch correctly initializes the flowi6 instance allocated and used
by seg6_lookup_any_nexhtop(). Specifically, the entire flowi6 instance
is wiped out: in case new entries are added to flowi/flowi6 (as happened
with the flowi_l3mdev entry), we should no longer have incorrectly
initialized values. As a result of this operation, the value of
flowi_l3mdev is also set to 0.

The proposed fix can be tested easily. Starting from the commit
referenced in the Fixes, selftests [1],[2] indicate that the SRv6
End.DT6 (VRF mode)/DT46 behaviors no longer work correctly. By applying
this patch, those behaviors are back to work properly again.

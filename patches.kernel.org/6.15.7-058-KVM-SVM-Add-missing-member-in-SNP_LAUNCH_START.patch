Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Add missing member in SNP_LAUNCH_START command
 structure
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.7
Git-commit: 51a4273dcab39dd1e850870945ccec664352d383

commit 51a4273dcab39dd1e850870945ccec664352d383 upstream.

The sev_data_snp_launch_start structure should include a 4-byte
desired_tsc_khz field before the gosvw field, which was missed in the
initial implementation. As a result, the structure is 4 bytes shorter than
expected by the firmware, causing the gosvw field to start 4 bytes early.
Fix this by adding the missing 4-byte member for the desired TSC frequency.

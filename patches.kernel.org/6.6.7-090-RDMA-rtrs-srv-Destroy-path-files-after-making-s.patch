Subject: [PATCH] RDMA/rtrs-srv: Destroy path files after making sure no IOs
 in-flight
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.7
Git-commit: c4d32e77fc1006f99eeb78417efc3d81a384072a

[ Upstream commit c4d32e77fc1006f99eeb78417efc3d81a384072a ]

Destroying path files may lead to the freeing of rdma_stats. This creates
the following race.

An IO is in-flight, or has just passed the session state check in
process_read/process_write. The close_work gets triggered and the function
rtrs_srv_close_work() starts and does destroy path which frees the
rdma_stats. After this the function process_read/process_write resumes and
tries to update the stats through the function rtrs_srv_update_rdma_stats

This commit solves the problem by moving the destroy path function to a
later point. This point makes sure any inflights are completed. This is
done by qp drain, and waiting for all in-flights through ops_id.

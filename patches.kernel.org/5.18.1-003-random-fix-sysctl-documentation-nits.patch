Subject: [PATCH] random: fix sysctl documentation nits
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.1
Git-commit: 069c4ea6871c18bd368f27756e0f91ffb524a788

commit 069c4ea6871c18bd368f27756e0f91ffb524a788 upstream.

A semicolon was missing, and the almost-alphabetical-but-not ordering
was confusing, so regroup these by category instead.

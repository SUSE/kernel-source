Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: renesas: r8a779g0: Fix HSCIF0 interrupt number
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.9
Git-commit: ab2866f12ca18747413ba41409231d44e0c6149b

[ Upstream commit ab2866f12ca18747413ba41409231d44e0c6149b ]

The interrupt number for the HSCIF0 serial port, which serves as the
serial console on the White Hawk board, is incorrect, causing userspace
to hang immediately as soon as it tries to print something.
Kernel output is unaffected, as it is printed using polling.

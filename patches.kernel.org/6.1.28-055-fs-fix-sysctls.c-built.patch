Subject: [PATCH] fs: fix sysctls.c built
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: e3184de9d46c2eebdb776face2e2662c6733331d

commit e3184de9d46c2eebdb776face2e2662c6733331d upstream.

'obj-$(CONFIG_SYSCTL) += sysctls.o' must be moved after "obj-y :=",
or it won't be built as it is overwrited.

Note that there is nothing that is going to break by linking
sysctl.o later, we were just being way to cautious and patches
have been updated to reflect these considerations and sent for
stable as well with the whole "base" stuff needing to be linked
prior to child sysctl tables that use that directory. All of
the kernel sysctl APIs always share the same directory, and races
against using it should end up re-using the same single created
directory.

And so something we can do eventually is do away with all the base stuff.
For now it's fine, it's not creating an issue. It is just a bit pedantic
and careful.

Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: Prevent integer underflow
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 8d8e16592022c9650df8aedfe6552ed478d7135b

[ Upstream commit 8d8e16592022c9650df8aedfe6552ed478d7135b ]

By using a ratio of delay to poll_enabled_time that is not integer
time_remaining underflows and does not exit the loop as expected.
As delay could be derived from DT and poll_enabled_time is defined
in the driver this can easily happen.

Use a signed iterator to make sure that the loop exits once
the remaining time is negative.

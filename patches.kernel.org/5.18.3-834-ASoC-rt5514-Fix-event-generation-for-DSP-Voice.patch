Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rt5514: Fix event generation for "DSP Voice Wake Up"
 control
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 4213ff556740bb45e2d9ff0f50d056c4e7dd0921

commit 4213ff556740bb45e2d9ff0f50d056c4e7dd0921 upstream.

The driver has a custom put function for "DSP Voice Wake Up" which does
not generate event notifications on change, instead returning 0. Since we
already exit early in the case that there is no change this can be fixed
by unconditionally returning 1 at the end of the function.

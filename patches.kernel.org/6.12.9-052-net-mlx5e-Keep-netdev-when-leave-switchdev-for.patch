Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5e: Keep netdev when leave switchdev for devlink set
 legacy only
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.9
Git-commit: 2a4f56fbcc473d8faeb29b73082df39efbe5893c

[ Upstream commit 2a4f56fbcc473d8faeb29b73082df39efbe5893c ]

In the cited commit, when changing from switchdev to legacy mode,
uplink representor's netdev is kept, and its profile is replaced with
nic profile, so netdev is detached from old profile, then attach to
new profile.

During profile change, the hardware resources allocated by the old
profile will be cleaned up. However, the cleanup is relying on the
related kernel modules. And they may need to flush themselves first,
which is triggered by netdev events, for example, NETDEV_UNREGISTER.
However, netdev is kept, or netdev_register is called after the
cleanup, which may cause troubles because the resources are still
referred by kernel modules.

The same process applies to all the caes when uplink is leaving
switchdev mode, including devlink eswitch mode set legacy, driver
unload and devlink reload. For the first one, it can be blocked and
returns failure to users, whenever possible. But it's hard for the
others. Besides, the attachment to nic profile is unnecessary as the
netdev will be unregistered anyway for such cases.

So in this patch, the original behavior is kept only for devlink
eswitch set mode legacy. For the others, moves netdev unregistration
before the profile change.

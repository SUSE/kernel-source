Subject: [PATCH] media: iris: Fix memory leak by freeing untracked persist
 buffer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.1
Git-commit: 02a24f13b3a1d9da9f3de56aa5fdb7cc1fe167a2

commit 02a24f13b3a1d9da9f3de56aa5fdb7cc1fe167a2 upstream.

One internal buffer which is allocated only once per session was not
being freed during session close because it was not being tracked as
part of internal buffer list which resulted in a memory leak.

Add the necessary logic to explicitly free the untracked internal buffer
during session close to ensure all allocated memory is released
properly.

Subject: [PATCH] coresight: platform: acpi: Ignore the absence of graph
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.3
Git-commit: 3a2888aa1f962c55ca36119aebe67355c7bf54e4

[ Upstream commit 3a2888aa1f962c55ca36119aebe67355c7bf54e4 ]

Some components may not have graph connections for describing
the trace path. e.g., ETE, where it could directly use the per
CPU TRBE. Ignore the absence of graph connections

Subject: [PATCH] ipv4: Fix incorrect TOS in fibmatch route get reply
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.44
Git-commit: f036e68212c11e5a7edbb59b5e25299341829485

[ Upstream commit f036e68212c11e5a7edbb59b5e25299341829485 ]

The TOS value that is returned to user space in the route get reply is
the one with which the lookup was performed ('fl4->flowi4_tos'). This is
fine when the matched route is configured with a TOS as it would not
match if its TOS value did not match the one with which the lookup was
performed.

However, matching on TOS is only performed when the route's TOS is not
zero. It is therefore possible to have the kernel incorrectly return a
non-zero TOS:

 # ip link add name dummy1 up type dummy
 # ip address add 192.0.2.1/24 dev dummy1
 # ip route get fibmatch 192.0.2.2 tos 0xfc
 192.0.2.0/24 tos 0x1c dev dummy1 proto kernel scope link src 192.0.2.1

Fix by instead returning the DSCP field from the FIB result structure
which was populated during the route lookup.

Output after the patch:

 # ip link add name dummy1 up type dummy
 # ip address add 192.0.2.1/24 dev dummy1
 # ip route get fibmatch 192.0.2.2 tos 0xfc
 192.0.2.0/24 dev dummy1 proto kernel scope link src 192.0.2.1

Extend the existing selftests to not only verify that the correct route
is returned, but that it is also returned with correct "tos" value (or
without it).

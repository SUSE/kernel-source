Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ibmvfc: Fix command state accounting and stale response
 detection
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.10
Git-commit: a264cf5e81c78e2b9918b8b9ef2ace9dde1850df

commit a264cf5e81c78e2b9918b8b9ef2ace9dde1850df upstream.

Prior to commit 1f4a4a19508d ("scsi: ibmvfc: Complete commands outside the
host/queue lock") responses to commands were completed sequentially with
the host lock held such that a command had a basic binary state of active
or free. It was therefore a simple affair of ensuring the assocaiated
ibmvfc_event to a VIOS response was valid by testing that it was not
already free. The lock relexation work to complete commands outside the
lock inadverdently made it a trinary command state such that a command is
either in flight, received and being completed, or completed and now
free. This breaks the stale command detection logic as a command may be
still marked active and been placed on the delayed completion list when a
second stale response for the same command arrives. This can lead to double
completions and list corruption. This issue was exposed by a recent VIOS
regression were a missing memory barrier could occasionally result in the
ibmvfc client receiving a duplicate response for the same command.

Fix the issue by introducing the atomic ibmvfc_event.active to track the
trinary state of a command. The state is explicitly set to 1 when a command
is successfully sent. The CRQ response handlers use
atomic_dec_if_positive() to test for stale responses and correctly
transition to the completion state when a active command is received.
Finally, atomic_dec_and_test() is used to sanity check transistions when
commands are freed as a result of a completion, or moved to the purge list
as a result of error handling or adapter reset.

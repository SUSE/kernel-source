Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spinand: propagate spinand_wait() errors from
 spinand_write_page()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.44
Git-commit: 091d9e35b85b0f8f7e1c73535299f91364a5c73a

commit 091d9e35b85b0f8f7e1c73535299f91364a5c73a upstream.

Since commit 3d1f08b032dc ("mtd: spinand: Use the external ECC engine
logic") the spinand_write_page() function ignores the errors returned
by spinand_wait(). Change the code to propagate those up to the stack
as it was done before the offending change.

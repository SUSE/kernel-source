Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: scan: Add LATT2021 to acpi_ignore_dep_ids[]
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: fa153b7cddce795662d38f78a87612c166c0f692

[ Upstream commit fa153b7cddce795662d38f78a87612c166c0f692 ]

Some x86/ACPI laptops with MIPI cameras have a LATT2021 ACPI device
in the _DEP dependency list of the ACPI devices for the camera-sensors
(which have flags.honor_deps set).

The _DDN for the LATT2021 device is "Lattice FW Update Client Driver",
suggesting that this is used for firmware updates of something. There
is no Linux driver for this and if Linux gets support for updates it
will likely be in userspace through fwupd.

For now add the LATT2021 HID to acpi_ignore_dep_ids[] so that
acpi_dev_ready_for_enumeration() will return true once the other _DEP
dependencies are met.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: fix unpriv_disabled check in test_verifier
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: d128860dbb29cafc3c65ca2d22082745a32829dd

[ Upstream commit d128860dbb29cafc3c65ca2d22082745a32829dd ]

Commit 1d56ade032a49 changed the function get_unpriv_disabled() to
return its results as a bool instead of updating a global variable, but
test_verifier was not updated to keep in line with these changes. Thus
unpriv_disabled is always false in test_verifier and unprivileged tests
are not properly skipped on systems with unprivileged bpf disabled.

Fixes: 1d56ade032a49 ("selftests/bpf: Unprivileged tests for test_loader.c")

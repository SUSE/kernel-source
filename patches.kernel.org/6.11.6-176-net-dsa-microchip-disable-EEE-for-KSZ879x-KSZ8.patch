Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: microchip: disable EEE for KSZ879x/KSZ877x/KSZ876x
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.6
Git-commit: ee76eb24343bdd5450eb87572865a4d7fffd335b

[ Upstream commit ee76eb24343bdd5450eb87572865a4d7fffd335b ]

The well-known errata regarding EEE not being functional on various KSZ
switches has been refactored a few times. Recently the refactoring has
excluded several switches that the errata should also apply to.

Disable EEE for additional switches with this errata and provide
additional comments referring to the public errata document.

The original workaround for the errata was applied with a register
write to manually disable the EEE feature in MMD 7:60 which was being
applied for KSZ9477/KSZ9897/KSZ9567 switch ID's.

Then came commit 26dd2974c5b5 ("net: phy: micrel: Move KSZ9477 errata
fixes to PHY driver") and commit 6068e6d7ba50 ("net: dsa: microchip:
remove KSZ9477 PHY errata handling") which moved the errata from the
switch driver to the PHY driver but only for PHY_ID_KSZ9477 (PHY ID)
however that PHY code was dead code because an entry was never added
for PHY_ID_KSZ9477 via MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE.

This was apparently realized much later and commit 54a4e5c16382 ("net:
phy: micrel: add Microchip KSZ 9477 to the device table") added the
PHY_ID_KSZ9477 to the PHY driver but as the errata was only being
applied to PHY_ID_KSZ9477 it's not completely clear what switches
that relates to.

Later commit 6149db4997f5 ("net: phy: micrel: fix KSZ9477 PHY issues
after suspend/resume") breaks this again for all but KSZ9897 by only
applying the errata for that PHY ID.

Following that this was affected with commit 08c6d8bae48c("net: phy:
Provide Module 4 KSZ9477 errata (DS80000754C)") which removes
the blatant register write to MMD 7:60 and replaces it by
setting phydev->eee_broken_modes = -1 so that the generic phy-c45 code
disables EEE but this is only done for the KSZ9477_CHIP_ID (Switch ID).

Lastly commit 0411f73c13af ("net: dsa: microchip: disable EEE for
KSZ8567/KSZ9567/KSZ9896/KSZ9897.") adds some additional switches
that were missing to the errata due to the previous changes.

This commit adds an additional set of switches.

Fixes: 0411f73c13af ("net: dsa: microchip: disable EEE for KSZ8567/KSZ9567/KSZ9896/KSZ9897.")

[ Upstream commit bf8bbaefaa6ae0a07971ea57b3208df60e8ad0a4 ]

Since its inception, the GPU scheduler can leak memory if the driver
calls drm_sched_fini() while there are still jobs in flight.

The simplest way to solve this in a backwards compatible manner is by
adding a new callback, drm_sched_backend_ops.cancel_job(), which
instructs the driver to signal the hardware fence associated with the
job. Afterwards, the scheduler can safely use the established free_job()
callback for freeing the job.

Implement the new backend_ops callback cancel_job().

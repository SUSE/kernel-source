Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: seq: Make dependency on UMP clearer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: 9001d515443518d72222ba4d58e247696b625071

[ Upstream commit 9001d515443518d72222ba4d58e247696b625071 ]

CONFIG_SND_SEQ_UMP_CLIENT is a Kconfig for a sequencer client
corresponding to the UMP rawmidi, while we have another major knob
CONFIG_SND_SEQ_UMP that specifies whether the sequencer core supports
UMP packets or not.  Strictly speaking both of them are independent,
but practically seen, it makes no sense to enable
CONFIG_SND_SEQ_UMP_CLIENT without UMP support itself.

This patch makes such an implicit dependency clearer.  Now
CONFIG_SND_SEQ_UMP_CLIENT depends on both CONFIG_SND_UMP and
CONFIG_SND_SEQ_UMP.  Meanwhile, CONFIG_SND_SEQ_UMP is enabled as
default when CONFIG_SND_UMP is set.

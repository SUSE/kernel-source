Subject: [PATCH] net: hns3: fix fail to delete tc flower rules during reset
 issue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.56
Git-commit: 1a7be66e4685b8541546222c305cce9710718a88

[ Upstream commit 1a7be66e4685b8541546222c305cce9710718a88 ]

Firmware does not respond driver commands during reset
Therefore, rule will fail to delete while the firmware is resetting

So, if failed to delete rule, set rule state to TO_DEL,
and the rule will be deleted when periodic task being scheduled.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: ignore fiemap path cache when there are multiple paths
 for a node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.10
Git-commit: 2280d425ba3599bdd85c41bd0ec8ba568f00c032

commit 2280d425ba3599bdd85c41bd0ec8ba568f00c032 upstream.

During fiemap, when walking backreferences to determine if a b+tree
node/leaf is shared, we may find a tree block (leaf or node) for which
two parents were added to the references ulist. This happens if we get
for example one direct ref (shared tree block ref) and one indirect ref
(non-shared tree block ref) for the tree block at the current level,
which can happen during relocation.

In that case the fiemap path cache can not be used since it's meant for
a single path, with one tree block at each possible level, so having
multiple references for a tree block at any level may result in getting
the level counter exceed BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL and eventually trigger the
warning:

   WARN_ON_ONCE(level >= BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL)

at lookup_backref_shared_cache() and at store_backref_shared_cache().
This is harmless since the code ignores any level >= BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL, the
warning is there just to catch any unexpected case like the one described
above. However if a user finds this it may be scary and get reported.

So just ignore the path cache once we find a tree block for which there
are more than one reference, which is the less common case, and update
the cache with the sharedness check result for all levels below the level
for which we found multiple references.

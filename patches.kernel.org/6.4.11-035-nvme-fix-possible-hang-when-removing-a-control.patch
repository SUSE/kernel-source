Subject: [PATCH] nvme: fix possible hang when removing a controller during
 error recovery
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.11
Git-commit: 1b95e817916069ec45a7f259d088fd1c091a8cc6

commit 1b95e817916069ec45a7f259d088fd1c091a8cc6 upstream.

Error recovery can be interrupted by controller removal, then the
controller is left as quiesced, and IO hang can be caused.

Fix the issue by unquiescing controller unconditionally when removing
namespaces.

This way is reasonable and safe given forward progress can be made
when removing namespaces.

Subject: [PATCH] power: supply: bq24190: Call power_supply_changed() after
 updating input current
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.5
Git-commit: 77c2a3097d7029441e8a91aa0de1b4e5464593da

commit 77c2a3097d7029441e8a91aa0de1b4e5464593da upstream.

The bq24192 model relies on external charger-type detection and once
that is done the bq24190_charger code will update the input current.

In this case, when the initial power_supply_changed() call is made
from the interrupt handler, the input settings are 5V/0.5A which
on many devices is not enough power to charge (while the device is on).

On many devices the fuel-gauge relies in its external_power_changed
callback to timely signal userspace about charging <-> discharging
status changes. Add a power_supply_changed() call after updating
the input current. This allows the fuel-gauge driver to timely recheck
if the battery is charging after the new input current has been applied
and then it can immediately notify userspace about this.

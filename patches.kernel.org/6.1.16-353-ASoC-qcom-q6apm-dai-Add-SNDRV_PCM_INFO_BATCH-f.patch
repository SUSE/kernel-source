Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: qcom: q6apm-dai: Add SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH flag
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: aa759f3f9f4394a3af65ad1772fca6cb9dd9e4cc

[ Upstream commit aa759f3f9f4394a3af65ad1772fca6cb9dd9e4cc ]

At the moment, playing audio with PulseAudio with the qdsp6 driver
results in distorted sound. It seems like its timer-based scheduling
does not work properly with qdsp6 since setting tsched=0 in
the PulseAudio configuration avoids the issue.

Apparently this happens when the pointer() callback is not accurate
enough. There is a SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH flag that can be used to stop
PulseAudio from using timer-based scheduling by default.

According to https://www.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2014-March/073816.html:

The flag is being used in the sense explained in the previous audio
meeting -- the data transfer granularity isn't fine enough but aligned
to the period size (or less).

q6apm-dai reports the position as multiple of

prtd->pcm_count = snd_pcm_lib_period_bytes(substream)

so it indeed just a multiple of the period size.

Therefore adding the flag here seems appropriate and makes audio
work out of the box.

Comment log inspired by Stephan Gerhold sent for q6asm-dai.c few years back.

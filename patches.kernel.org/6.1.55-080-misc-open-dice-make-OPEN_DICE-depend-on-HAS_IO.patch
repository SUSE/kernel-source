Subject: [PATCH] misc: open-dice: make OPEN_DICE depend on HAS_IOMEM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.55
Git-commit: aefc8b57af7787c80686e49a5841e9289cb11f53

[ Upstream commit aefc8b57af7787c80686e49a5841e9289cb11f53 ]

On s390 systems (aka mainframes), it has classic channel devices for
networking and permanent storage that are currently even more common
than PCI devices. Hence it could have a fully functional s390 kernel
with CONFIG_PCI=n, then the relevant iomem mapping functions
[including ioremap(), devm_ioremap(), etc.] are not available.

Here let OPEN_DICE depend on HAS_IOMEM so that it won't be built
to cause below compiling error if PCI is unset:

------
ERROR: modpost: "devm_memremap" [drivers/misc/open-dice.ko] undefined!
ERROR: modpost: "devm_memunmap" [drivers/misc/open-dice.ko] undefined!
------

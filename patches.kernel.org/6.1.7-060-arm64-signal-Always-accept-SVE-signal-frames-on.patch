Subject: [PATCH] arm64/signal: Always accept SVE signal frames on SME only
 systems
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.7
Git-commit: 7dde62f0687c8856b6c0660066c7ee83a6a6f033

commit 7dde62f0687c8856b6c0660066c7ee83a6a6f033 upstream.

Currently we reject an attempt to restore a SVE signal frame on a system
with SME but not SVE supported. This means that it is not possible to
disable streaming mode via signal return as this is configured via the
flags in the SVE signal context. Instead accept the signal frame, we will
require it to have a vector length of 0 specified and no payload since the
task will have no SVE vector length configured.

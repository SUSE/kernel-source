Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: mtd: gpmc: Fix the ECC bytes vs. OOB bytes
 equation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.7
Git-commit: 778cb8e39f6ec252be50fc3850d66f3dcbd5dd5a

[ Upstream commit 778cb8e39f6ec252be50fc3850d66f3dcbd5dd5a ]

"PAGESIZE / 512" is the number of ECC chunks.
"ECC_BYTES" is the number of bytes needed to store a single ECC code.
"2" is the space reserved by the bad block marker.

"2 + (PAGESIZE / 512) * ECC_BYTES" should of course be lower or equal
than the total number of OOB bytes, otherwise it won't fit.

Fix the equation by substituting s/>=/<=/.

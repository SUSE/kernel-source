Subject: [PATCH] ARM: fix Thumb2 regression with Spectre BHB
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.15
Git-commit: 6c7cb60bff7aec24b834343ff433125f469886a3

commit 6c7cb60bff7aec24b834343ff433125f469886a3 upstream.

When building for Thumb2, the vectors make use of a local label. Sadly,
the Spectre BHB code also uses a local label with the same number which
results in the Thumb2 reference pointing at the wrong place. Fix this
by changing the number used for the Spectre BHB local label.

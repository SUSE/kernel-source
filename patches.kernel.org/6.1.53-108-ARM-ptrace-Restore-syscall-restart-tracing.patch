Subject: [PATCH] ARM: ptrace: Restore syscall restart tracing
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: cf007647475b5090819c5fe8da771073145c7334

[ Upstream commit cf007647475b5090819c5fe8da771073145c7334 ]

Since commit 4e57a4ddf6b0 ("ARM: 9107/1: syscall: always store
thread_info->abi_syscall"), the seccomp selftests "syscall_restart" has
been broken. This was caused by the restart syscall not being stored to
"abi_syscall" during restart setup before branching to the "local_restart"
label. Tracers would see the wrong syscall, and scno would get overwritten
while returning from the TIF_WORK path. Add the missing store.

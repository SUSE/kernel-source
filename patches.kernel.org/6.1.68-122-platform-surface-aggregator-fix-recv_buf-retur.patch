commit c8820c92caf0770bec976b01fa9e82bb993c5865 upstream.

Serdev recv_buf() callback is supposed to return the amount of bytes
consumed, therefore an int in between 0 and count.

Do not return negative number in case of issue, when
ssam_controller_receive_buf() returns ESHUTDOWN just returns 0, e.g. no
bytes consumed, this keep the exact same behavior as it was before.

This fixes a potential WARN in serdev-ttyport.c:ttyport_receive_buf().

Fixes: c167b9c7e3d6 ("platform/surface: Add Surface Aggregator subsystem")

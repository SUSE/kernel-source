Subject: [PATCH] rust: don't select CONSTRUCTORS
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.9
Git-commit: 7d49f53af4b988b188d3932deac2c9c80fd7d9ce

commit 7d49f53af4b988b188d3932deac2c9c80fd7d9ce upstream.

This was originally part of commit 4b9a68f2e59a0 ("rust: add support for
static synchronisation primitives") from the old Rust branch, which used
module constructors to initialize globals containing various
synchronisation primitives with pin-init. That commit has never been
upstreamed, but the `select CONSTRUCTORS` statement ended up being
included in the patch that initially added Rust support to the Linux
Kernel.

We are not using module constructors, so let's remove the select.

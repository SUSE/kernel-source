Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Fix a benign off-by-one bug in AVIC physical table
 mask
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.21
Git-commit: 3ec7a1b2743c07c45f4a0c508114f6cb410ddef3

commit 3ec7a1b2743c07c45f4a0c508114f6cb410ddef3 upstream.

Define the "physical table max index mask" as bits 8:0, not 9:0.  x2AVIC
currently supports a max of 512 entries, i.e. the max index is 511, and
the inputs to GENMASK_ULL() are inclusive.  The bug is benign as bit 9 is
reserved and never set by KVM, i.e. KVM is just clearing bits that are
guaranteed to be zero.

Note, as of this writing, APM "Rev. 3.39-October 2022" incorrectly states
that bits 11:8 are reserved in Table B-1. VMCB Layout, Control Area.  I.e.
that table wasn't updated when x2AVIC support was added.

Opportunistically fix the comment for the max AVIC ID to align with the
code, and clean up comment formatting too.

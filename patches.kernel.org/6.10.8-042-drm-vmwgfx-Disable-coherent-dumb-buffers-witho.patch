Subject: [PATCH] drm/vmwgfx: Disable coherent dumb buffers without 3d
Patch-mainline: 6.10.8
References: bsc#1012628 bsc#1229627
Git-commit: e9fd436bb8fb9b9d31fdf07bbcdba6d30290c5e4

commit e9fd436bb8fb9b9d31fdf07bbcdba6d30290c5e4 upstream.

Coherent surfaces make only sense if the host renders to them using
accelerated apis. Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers stays
in the guest making all of the extra work they're doing to synchronize
between guest and host useless.

Configurations without 3d also tend to run with very low graphics
memory limits. The pinned console fb, mob cursors and graphical login
manager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests use.

Fix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used on
configs with 3d enabled.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/gt: Do not consider preemption during
 execlists_dequeue for gen8
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 65564157ae64cec0f527583f96e32f484f730f92

commit 65564157ae64cec0f527583f96e32f484f730f92 upstream.

We're seeing a GPU hang issue on a CHV platform, which was caused by commit
bac24f59f454 ("drm/i915/execlists: Enable coarse preemption boundaries for
Gen8").

The Gen8 platform only supports timeslicing and doesn't have a preemption
mechanism, as its engines do not have a preemption timer.

Commit 751f82b353a6 ("drm/i915/gt: Only disable preemption on Gen8 render
engines") addressed this issue only for render engines. This patch extends
that fix by ensuring that preemption is not considered for all engines on
Gen8 platforms.

v4:
 - Use the correct Fixes tag (Rodrigo Vivi)
 - Reworded commit log (Andi Shyti)

v3:
 - Inside need_preempt(), condition of can_preempt() is not required
   as simplified can_preempt() is enough. (Chris Wilson)

v2: Simplify can_preempt() function (Tvrtko Ursulin)

Fixes: 751f82b353a6 ("drm/i915/gt: Only disable preemption on gen8 render engines")

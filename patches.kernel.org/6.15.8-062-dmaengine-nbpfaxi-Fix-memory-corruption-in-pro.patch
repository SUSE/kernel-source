Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: nbpfaxi: Fix memory corruption in probe()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.8
Git-commit: 188c6ba1dd925849c5d94885c8bbdeb0b3dcf510

commit 188c6ba1dd925849c5d94885c8bbdeb0b3dcf510 upstream.

The nbpf->chan[] array is allocated earlier in the nbpf_probe() function
and it has "num_channels" elements.  These three loops iterate one
element farther than they should and corrupt memory.

The changes to the second loop are more involved.  In this case, we're
copying data from the irqbuf[] array into the nbpf->chan[] array.  If
the data in irqbuf[i] is the error IRQ then we skip it, so the iterators
are not in sync.  I added a check to ensure that we don't go beyond the
end of the irqbuf[] array.  I'm pretty sure this can't happen, but it
seemed harmless to add a check.

On the other hand, after the loop has ended there is a check to ensure
that the "chan" iterator is where we expect it to be.  In the original
code we went one element beyond the end of the array so the iterator
wasn't in the correct place and it would always return -EINVAL.  However,
now it will always be in the correct place.  I deleted the check since
we know the result.

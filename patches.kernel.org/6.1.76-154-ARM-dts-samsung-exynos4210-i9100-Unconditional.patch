Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: samsung: exynos4210-i9100: Unconditionally enable
 LDO12
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.76
Git-commit: 84228d5e29dbc7a6be51e221000e1d122125826c

[ Upstream commit 84228d5e29dbc7a6be51e221000e1d122125826c ]

The kernel hangs for a good 12 seconds without any info being printed to
dmesg, very early in the boot process, if this regulator is not enabled.

Force-enable it to work around this issue, until we know more about the
underlying problem.

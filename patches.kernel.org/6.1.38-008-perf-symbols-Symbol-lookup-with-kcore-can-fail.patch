Subject: [PATCH] perf symbols: Symbol lookup with kcore can fail if multiple
 segments match stext
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.38
Git-commit: 1c249565426e3a9940102c0ba9f63914f7cda73d

commit 1c249565426e3a9940102c0ba9f63914f7cda73d upstream.

This problem was encountered on an arm64 system with a lot of memory.
Without kernel debug symbols installed, and with both kcore and kallsyms
available, perf managed to get confused and returned "unknown" for all
of the kernel symbols that it tried to look up.

On this system, stext fell within the vmalloc segment.  The kcore symbol
matching code tries to find the first segment that contains stext and
uses that to replace the segment generated from just the kallsyms
information.  In this case, however, there were two: a very large
vmalloc segment, and the text segment.  This caused perf to get confused
because multiple overlapping segments were inserted into the RB tree
that holds the discovered segments.  However, that alone wasn't
sufficient to cause the problem. Even when we could find the segment,
the offsets were adjusted in such a way that the newly generated symbols
didn't line up with the instruction addresses in the trace.  The most
obvious solution would be to consult which segment type is text from
kcore, but this information is not exposed to users.

Instead, select the smallest matching segment that contains stext
instead of the first matching segment.  This allows us to match the text
segment instead of vmalloc, if one is contained within the other.

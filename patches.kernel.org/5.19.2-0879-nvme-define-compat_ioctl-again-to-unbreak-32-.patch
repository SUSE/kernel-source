Subject: [PATCH] nvme: define compat_ioctl again to unbreak 32-bit userspace.
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: a25d4261582cf00dad884c194d21084836663d3d

[ Upstream commit a25d4261582cf00dad884c194d21084836663d3d ]

Commit 89b3d6e60550 ("nvme: simplify the compat ioctl handling") removed
the initialization of compat_ioctl from the nvme block_device_operations
structures.

Presumably the expectation was that 32-bit ioctls would be directed
through the regular handler but this is not the case: failing to assign
.compat_ioctl actually means that the compat case is disabled entirely,
and any attempt to submit nvme ioctls from 32-bit userspace fails
outright with -ENOTTY.

For example:

  % smartctl -x /dev/nvme0n1
  [...]
  Read NVMe Identify Controller failed: NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD: Inappropriate ioctl for device

The blkdev_compat_ptr_ioctl helper can be used to direct compat calls
through the main ioctl handler and makes things work again.

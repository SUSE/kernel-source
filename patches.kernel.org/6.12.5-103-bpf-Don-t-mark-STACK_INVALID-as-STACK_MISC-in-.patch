Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Don't mark STACK_INVALID as STACK_MISC in
 mark_stack_slot_misc
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.5
Git-commit: 69772f509e084ec6bca12dbcdeeeff41b0103774

[ Upstream commit 69772f509e084ec6bca12dbcdeeeff41b0103774 ]

Inside mark_stack_slot_misc, we should not upgrade STACK_INVALID to
STACK_MISC when allow_ptr_leaks is false, since invalid contents
shouldn't be read unless the program has the relevant capabilities.
The relaxation only makes sense when env->allow_ptr_leaks is true.

However, such conversion in privileged mode becomes unnecessary, as
invalid slots can be read without being upgraded to STACK_MISC.

Currently, the condition is inverted (i.e. checking for true instead of
false), simply remove it to restore correct behavior.

Fixes: eaf18febd6eb ("bpf: preserve STACK_ZERO slots on partial reg spills")

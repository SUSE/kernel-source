Subject: [PATCH] net: ftgmac100: Enable TX interrupt to avoid TX timeout
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.52
Git-commit: fef2843bb49f414d1523ca007d088071dee0e055

[ Upstream commit fef2843bb49f414d1523ca007d088071dee0e055 ]

Currently, the driver only enables RX interrupt to handle RX
packets and TX resources. Sometimes there is not RX traffic,
so the TX resource needs to wait for RX interrupt to free.
This situation will toggle the TX timeout watchdog when the MAC
TX ring has no more resources to transmit packets.
Therefore, enable TX interrupt to release TX resources at any time.

When I am verifying iperf3 over UDP, the network hangs.
Like the log below.

iperf3: error - the server has terminated

The network topology is FTGMAC connects directly to a PC.
UDP does not need to wait for ACK, unlike TCP.
Therefore, FTGMAC needs to enable TX interrupt to release TX resources instead
of waiting for the RX interrupt.

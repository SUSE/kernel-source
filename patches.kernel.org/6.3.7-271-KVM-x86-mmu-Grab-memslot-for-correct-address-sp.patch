Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/mmu: Grab memslot for correct address space in NX
 recovery worker
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.7
Git-commit: 817fa998362d6ea9fabd5e97af8e9e2eb5f0e6f2

commit 817fa998362d6ea9fabd5e97af8e9e2eb5f0e6f2 upstream.

Factor in the address space (non-SMM vs. SMM) of the target shadow page
when recovering potential NX huge pages, otherwise KVM will retrieve the
wrong memslot when zapping shadow pages that were created for SMM.  The
bug most visibly manifests as a WARN on the memslot being non-NULL, but
the worst case scenario is that KVM could unaccount the shadow page
without ensuring KVM won't install a huge page, i.e. if the non-SMM slot
is being dirty logged, but the SMM slot is not.

This bug was exposed by commit edbdb43fc96b ("KVM: x86: Preserve TDP MMU
roots until they are explicitly invalidated"), which allowed KVM to retain
SMM TDP MMU roots effectively indefinitely.  Before commit edbdb43fc96b,
KVM would zap all SMM TDP MMU roots and thus all SMM TDP MMU shadow pages
once all vCPUs exited SMM, which made the window where this bug (recovering
an SMM NX huge page) could be encountered quite tiny.  To hit the bug, the
NX recovery thread would have to run while at least one vCPU was in SMM.
Most VMs typically only use SMM during boot, and so the problematic shadow
pages were gone by the time the NX recovery thread ran.

Now that KVM preserves TDP MMU roots until they are explicitly invalidated
(e.g. by a memslot deletion), the window to trigger the bug is effectively
never closed because most VMMs don't delete memslots after boot (except
for a handful of special scenarios).

Subject: [PATCH] x86/bugs: Clarify that syscall hardening isn't a BHI
 mitigation
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.28
Git-commit: 5f882f3b0a8bf0788d5a0ee44b1191de5319bb8a

commit 5f882f3b0a8bf0788d5a0ee44b1191de5319bb8a upstream.

While syscall hardening helps prevent some BHI attacks, there's still
other low-hanging fruit remaining.  Don't classify it as a mitigation
and make it clear that the system may still be vulnerable if it doesn't
have a HW or SW mitigation enabled.

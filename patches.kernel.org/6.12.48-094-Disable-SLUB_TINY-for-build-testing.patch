Subject: [PATCH] Disable SLUB_TINY for build testing
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.48
Git-commit: 6f110a5e4f9977c31ce76fefbfef6fd4eab6bfb7

[ Upstream commit 6f110a5e4f9977c31ce76fefbfef6fd4eab6bfb7 ]

... and don't error out so hard on missing module descriptions.

Before commit 6c6c1fc09de3 ("modpost: require a MODULE_DESCRIPTION()")
we used to warn about missing module descriptions, but only when
building with extra warnigns (ie 'W=1').

After that commit the warning became an unconditional hard error.

And it turns out not all modules have been converted despite the claims
to the contrary.  As reported by Damian Tometzki, the slub KUnit test
didn't have a module description, and apparently nobody ever really
noticed.

The reason nobody noticed seems to be that the slub KUnit tests get
disabled by SLUB_TINY, which also ends up disabling a lot of other code,
both in tests and in slub itself.  And so anybody doing full build tests
didn't actually see this failre.

So let's disable SLUB_TINY for build-only tests, since it clearly ends
up limiting build coverage.  Also turn the missing module descriptions
error back into a warning, but let's keep it around for non-'W=1'
builds.

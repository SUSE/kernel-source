Subject: [PATCH] error-injection: Add prompt for function error injection
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.12
Git-commit: a4412fdd49dc011bcc2c0d81ac4cab7457092650

commit a4412fdd49dc011bcc2c0d81ac4cab7457092650 upstream.

The config to be able to inject error codes into any function annotated
with ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() is enabled when FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION is
enabled.  But unfortunately, this is always enabled on x86 when KPROBES
is enabled, and there's no way to turn it off.

As kprobes is useful for observability of the kernel, it is useful to
have it enabled in production environments.  But error injection should
be avoided.  Add a prompt to the config to allow it to be disabled even
when kprobes is enabled, and get rid of the "def_bool y".

This is a kernel debug feature (it's in Kconfig.debug), and should have
never been something enabled by default.

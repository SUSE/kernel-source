[ Upstream commit d44084c93427bb0a9261432db1a8ca76a42d805e ]

A consumer is expected to disable a PWM before calling pwm_put(). And if
they didn't there is hopefully a good reason (or the consumer needs
fixing). Also if disabling an enabled PWM was the right thing to do,
this should better be done in the framework instead of in each low level
driver.

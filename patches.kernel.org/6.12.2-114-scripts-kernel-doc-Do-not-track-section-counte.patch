Subject: [PATCH] scripts/kernel-doc: Do not track section counter across
 processed files
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: be9264110e4e874622d588a75daf930539fdf6ea

[ Upstream commit be9264110e4e874622d588a75daf930539fdf6ea ]

The section counter tracks how many sections of kernel-doc were added.
The only real use of the counter value is to check if anything was
actually supposed to be output and give a warning is nothing is
available.

The current logic of remembering the initial value and then resetting
the value then when processing each file means that if a file has the
same number of sections as the previously processed one, a warning is
incorrectly given.

Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: reset blackhole on success with non-loopback ifaces
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.55
Git-commit: 833d4313bc1e9e194814917d23e8874d6b651649

[ Upstream commit 833d4313bc1e9e194814917d23e8874d6b651649 ]

When a first MPTCP connection gets successfully established after a
blackhole period, 'active_disable_times' was supposed to be reset when
this connection was done via any non-loopback interfaces.

Unfortunately, the opposite condition was checked: only reset when the
connection was established via a loopback interface. Fixing this by
simply looking at the opposite.

This is similar to what is done with TCP FastOpen, see
tcp_fastopen_active_disable_ofo_check().

This patch is a follow-up of a previous discussion linked to commit
893c49a78d9f ("mptcp: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in
mptcp_active_enable()."), see [1].

Fixes: 27069e7cb3d1 ("mptcp: disable active MPTCP in case of blackhole")

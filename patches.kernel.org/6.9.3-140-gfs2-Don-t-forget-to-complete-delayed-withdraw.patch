Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: Don't forget to complete delayed withdraw
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: b01189333ee91c1ae6cd96dfd1e3a3c2e69202f0

[ Upstream commit b01189333ee91c1ae6cd96dfd1e3a3c2e69202f0 ]

Commit fffe9bee14b0 ("gfs2: Delay withdraw from atomic context")
switched from gfs2_withdraw() to gfs2_withdraw_delayed() in
gfs2_ail_error(), but failed to then check if a delayed withdraw had
occurred.  Fix that by adding the missing check in __gfs2_ail_flush(),
where the spin locks are already dropped and a withdraw is possible.

Subject: [PATCH] usb: typec: stusb160x: Don't block probing of consumer of
 "connector" nodes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.6
Git-commit: 6b63376722d9e1b915a2948e9b30f4ba2712e3f5

commit 6b63376722d9e1b915a2948e9b30f4ba2712e3f5 upstream.

Similar as with tcpm this patch lets fw_devlink know not to wait on the
fwnode to be populated as a struct device.

Without this patch, USB functionality can be broken on some previously
supported boards.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: don't allow adding block device of less than 1 MB
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.50
Git-commit: 3d1267475b94b3df7a61e4ea6788c7c5d9e473c4

[ Upstream commit 3d1267475b94b3df7a61e4ea6788c7c5d9e473c4 ]

Commit 15ae0410c37a79 ("btrfs-progs: add error handling for
device_get_partition_size_fd_stat()") in btrfs-progs inadvertently
changed it so that if the BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl on a block device returned
a size of 0, this was no longer seen as an error condition.

Unfortunately this is how disconnected NBD devices behave, meaning that
with btrfs-progs 6.16 it's now possible to add a device you can't
remove:

  # btrfs device add /dev/nbd0 /root/temp
  # btrfs device remove /dev/nbd0 /root/temp
  ERROR: error removing device '/dev/nbd0': Invalid argument

This check should always have been done kernel-side anyway, so add a
check in btrfs_init_new_device() that the new device doesn't have a size
less than BTRFS_DEVICE_RANGE_RESERVED (i.e. 1 MB).

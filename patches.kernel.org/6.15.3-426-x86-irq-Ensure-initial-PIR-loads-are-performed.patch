Subject: [PATCH] x86/irq: Ensure initial PIR loads are performed exactly once
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 600e9606046ac3b9b7a3f0500d08a179df84c45e

[ Upstream commit 600e9606046ac3b9b7a3f0500d08a179df84c45e ]

Ensure the PIR is read exactly once at the start of handle_pending_pir(),
to guarantee that checking for an outstanding posted interrupt in a given
chuck doesn't reload the chunk from the "real" PIR.  Functionally, a reload
is benign, but it would defeat the purpose of pre-loading into a copy.

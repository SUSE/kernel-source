Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: KVM: Disable updating of "num_cpu" and "feature"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.5
Git-commit: 955853cf83657faa58572ef3f08b44f0f88885c1

commit 955853cf83657faa58572ef3f08b44f0f88885c1 upstream.

Property "num_cpu" and "feature" are read-only once eiointc is created,
which are set with KVM_DEV_LOONGARCH_EXTIOI_GRP_CTRL attr group before
device creation.

Attr group KVM_DEV_LOONGARCH_EXTIOI_GRP_SW_STATUS is to update register
and software state for migration and reset usage, property "num_cpu" and
"feature" can not be update again if it is created already.

Here discard write operation with property "num_cpu" and "feature" in
attr group KVM_DEV_LOONGARCH_EXTIOI_GRP_CTRL.

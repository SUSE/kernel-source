Subject: [PATCH] perf/core: Inherit event_caps
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.3
Git-commit: e3265a4386428d3d157d9565bb520aabff8b4bf0

commit e3265a4386428d3d157d9565bb520aabff8b4bf0 upstream.

It was reported that some perf event setup can make fork failed on
ARM64.  It was the case of a group of mixed hw and sw events and it
failed in perf_event_init_task() due to armpmu_event_init().

The ARM PMU code checks if all the events in a group belong to the
same PMU except for software events.  But it didn't set the event_caps
of inherited events and no longer identify them as software events.
Therefore the test failed in a child process.

A simple reproducer is:

  $ perf stat -e '{cycles,cs,instructions}' perf bench sched messaging
  # Running 'sched/messaging' benchmark:
  perf: fork(): Invalid argument

The perf stat was fine but the perf bench failed in fork().  Let's
inherit the event caps from the parent.

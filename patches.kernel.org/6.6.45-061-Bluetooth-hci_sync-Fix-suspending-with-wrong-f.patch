Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix suspending with wrong filter policy
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.45
Git-commit: 96b82af36efaa1787946e021aa3dc5410c05beeb

[ Upstream commit 96b82af36efaa1787946e021aa3dc5410c05beeb ]

When suspending the scan filter policy cannot be 0x00 (no acceptlist)
since that means the host has to process every advertisement report
waking up the system, so this attempts to check if hdev is marked as
suspended and if the resulting filter policy would be 0x00 (no
acceptlist) then skip passive scanning if thre no devices in the
acceptlist otherwise reset the filter policy to 0x01 so the acceptlist
is used since the devices programmed there can still wakeup be system.

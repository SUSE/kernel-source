Subject: [PATCH] cxl/hdm: Fix a benign lockdep splat
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.11
Git-commit: 36a1c2ee50f573972aea3c3019555f47ee0094c0

commit 36a1c2ee50f573972aea3c3019555f47ee0094c0 upstream.

The new helper "cxl_num_decoders_committed()" added a lockdep assertion
to validate that port->commit_end is protected against modification.
That assertion fires in init_hdm_decoder() where it is initializing
port->commit_end. Given that it is both accessing and writing that
property it obstensibly needs the lock.

In practice, CXL decoder commit rules (must commit in order) and the
in-order discovery of device decoders makes the manipulation of
->commit_end in init_hdm_decoder() safe. However, rather than rely on
the subtle rules of CXL hardware, just make the implementation obviously
correct from a software perspective.

The Fixes: tag is only for cleaning up a lockdep splat, there is no
functional issue addressed by this fix.

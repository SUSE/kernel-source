Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: renesas: r8a77990: Re-add voltages to OPP table
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: c193f877770291f30d1e00bc6f2bb0757fe7a532

[ Upstream commit c193f877770291f30d1e00bc6f2bb0757fe7a532 ]

When CONFIG_ENERGY_MODEL=y:

    cpu cpu0: EM: invalid perf. state: -22

When removing the (incorrect) voltages from the Operating Points
Parameters tables, it was assumed they were optional, and unused, when
none of the CPU nodes is tied to a regulator using the "cpu-supply"
property.  This assumption turned out to be incorrect, causing the
reported error message.

Fix this by re-adding the (correct) voltages.  Note that because all
voltages are identical, all operating points are considered to have the
same efficiency, and the energy model always picks the one with the
highest clock rate.

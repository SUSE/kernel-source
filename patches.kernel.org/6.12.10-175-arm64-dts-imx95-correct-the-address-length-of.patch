Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx95: correct the address length of
 netcmix_blk_ctrl
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.10
Git-commit: c5b8d2c370842e3f9a15655893d8c597e2d981d9

[ Upstream commit c5b8d2c370842e3f9a15655893d8c597e2d981d9 ]

The netc_blk_ctrl is controlled by the imx95-blk-ctl clock driver and
provides relevant clock configurations for NETC, SAI and MQS. Its address
length should be 8 bytes instead of 0x1000.

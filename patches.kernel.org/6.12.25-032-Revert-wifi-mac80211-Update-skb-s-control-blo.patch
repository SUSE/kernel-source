Subject: [PATCH] Revert "wifi: mac80211: Update skb's control block key in
 ieee80211_tx_dequeue()"
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.25
Git-commit: 0937cb5f345c79d702b4d0d744e2a2529b551cb2

[ Upstream commit 0937cb5f345c79d702b4d0d744e2a2529b551cb2 ]

This reverts commit a104042e2bf6528199adb6ca901efe7b60c2c27f.

Since the original bug seems to have been around for years,
but a new issue was report with the fix, revert the fix for
now. We have a couple of weeks to figure it out for this
release, if needed.

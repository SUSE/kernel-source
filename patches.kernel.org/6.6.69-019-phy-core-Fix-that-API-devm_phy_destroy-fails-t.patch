Subject: [PATCH] phy: core: Fix that API devm_phy_destroy() fails to destroy
 the phy
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.69
Git-commit: 4dc48c88fcf82b89fdebd83a906aaa64f40fb8a9

commit 4dc48c88fcf82b89fdebd83a906aaa64f40fb8a9 upstream.

For devm_phy_destroy(), its comment says it needs to invoke phy_destroy()
to destroy the phy, but it will not actually invoke the function since
devres_destroy() does not call devm_phy_consume(), and the missing
phy_destroy() call will cause that the phy fails to be destroyed.

Fortunately, the faulty API has not been used by current kernel tree.
Fix by using devres_release() instead of devres_destroy() within the API.

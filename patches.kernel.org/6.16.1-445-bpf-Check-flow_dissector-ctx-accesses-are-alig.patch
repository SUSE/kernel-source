Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Check flow_dissector ctx accesses are aligned
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: ead3d7b2b6afa5ee7958620c4329982a7d9c2b78

[ Upstream commit ead3d7b2b6afa5ee7958620c4329982a7d9c2b78 ]

flow_dissector_is_valid_access doesn't check that the context access is
aligned. As a consequence, an unaligned access within one of the exposed
field is considered valid and later rejected by
flow_dissector_convert_ctx_access when we try to convert it.

The later rejection is problematic because it's reported as a verifier
bug with a kernel warning and doesn't point to the right instruction in
verifier logs.

Fixes: d58e468b1112 ("flow_dissector: implements flow dissector BPF hook")

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath12k: Correct tid cleanup when tid setup fails
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.43
Git-commit: 4a2bf707270f897ab8077baee8ed5842a5321686

[ Upstream commit 4a2bf707270f897ab8077baee8ed5842a5321686 ]

Currently, if any error occurs during ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_setup(),
the tid value is already incremented, even though the corresponding
TID is not actually allocated. Proceed to
ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_delete() starting from unallocated tid,
which might leads to freeing unallocated TID and cause potential
crash or out-of-bounds access.

Hence, fix by correctly decrementing tid before cleanup to match only
the successfully allocated TIDs.

Also, remove tid-- from failure case of ath12k_dp_rx_peer_frag_setup(),
as decrementing the tid before cleanup in loop will take care of this.

Compile tested only.

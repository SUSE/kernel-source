Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Disable SS instance in Parkmode
 for USB
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.2
Git-commit: 0046325ae52079b46da13a7f84dd7b2a6f7c38f8

commit 0046325ae52079b46da13a7f84dd7b2a6f7c38f8 upstream.

For Gen-1 targets like MSM8998, it is seen that stressing out the
controller in host mode results in HC died error:

 xhci-hcd.12.auto: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
 xhci-hcd.12.auto: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
 xhci-hcd.12.auto: HC died; cleaning up

And at this instant only restarting the host mode fixes it. Disable
SuperSpeed instance in park mode for MSM8998 to mitigate this issue.

Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: act_ife: convert comma to semicolon
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.9
Git-commit: 205305c028ad986d0649b8b100bab6032dcd1bb5

commit 205305c028ad986d0649b8b100bab6032dcd1bb5 upstream.

Replace comma between expressions with semicolons.

Using a ',' in place of a ';' can have unintended side effects.
Although that is not the case here, it is seems best to use ';'
unless ',' is intended.

Found by inspection.
No functional change intended.
Compile tested only.

Subject: [PATCH] perf vendor events s390: Remove UTF-8 characters from JSON
 file
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.3
Git-commit: eb2feb68cb7d404288493c41480843bc9f404789

[ Upstream commit eb2feb68cb7d404288493c41480843bc9f404789 ]

Commit 7f76b31130680fb3 ("perf list: Add IBM z16 event description for
s390") contains the verbal description for z16 extended counter set.

However some entries of the public description contain UTF-8 characters
which breaks the build on some distros.

Fix this and remove the UTF-8 characters.

Fixes: 7f76b31130680fb3 ("perf list: Add IBM z16 event description for s390")

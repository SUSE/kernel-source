Subject: [PATCH] net: tls: fix marking packets as decrypted
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.35
Git-commit: a535d59432370343058755100ee75ab03c0e3f91

[ Upstream commit a535d59432370343058755100ee75ab03c0e3f91 ]

For TLS offload we mark packets with skb->decrypted to make sure
they don't escape the host without getting encrypted first.
The crypto state lives in the socket, so it may get detached
by a call to skb_orphan(). As a safety check - the egress path
drops all packets with skb->decrypted and no "crypto-safe" socket.

The skb marking was added to sendpage only (and not sendmsg),
because tls_device injected data into the TCP stack using sendpage.
This special case was missed when sendpage got folded into sendmsg.

Fixes: c5c37af6ecad ("tcp: Convert do_tcp_sendpages() to use MSG_SPLICE_PAGES")

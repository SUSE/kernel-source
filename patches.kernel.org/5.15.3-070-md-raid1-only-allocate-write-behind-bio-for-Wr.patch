Subject: [PATCH] md/raid1: only allocate write behind bio for WriteMostly
 device
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: fd3b6975e9c11c4fa00965f82a0bfbb3b7b44101

commit fd3b6975e9c11c4fa00965f82a0bfbb3b7b44101 upstream.

Commit 6607cd319b6b91bff94e90f798a61c031650b514 ("raid1: ensure write
behind bio has less than BIO_MAX_VECS sectors") tried to guarantee the
size of behind bio is not bigger than BIO_MAX_VECS sectors.

Unfortunately the same calltrace still could happen since an array could
enable write-behind without write mostly device.

To match the manpage of mdadm (which says "write-behind is only attempted
on drives marked as write-mostly"), we need to check WriteMostly flag to
avoid such unexpected behavior.

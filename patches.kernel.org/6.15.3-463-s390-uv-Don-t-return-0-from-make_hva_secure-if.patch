Subject: [PATCH] s390/uv: Don't return 0 from make_hva_secure() if the
 operation was not successful
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 3ec8a8330a1aa846dffbf1d64479213366c55b54

[ Upstream commit 3ec8a8330a1aa846dffbf1d64479213366c55b54 ]

If s390_wiggle_split_folio() returns 0 because splitting a large folio
succeeded, we will return 0 from make_hva_secure() even though a retry
is required. Return -EAGAIN in that case.

Otherwise, we'll return 0 from gmap_make_secure(), and consequently from
unpack_one(). In kvm_s390_pv_unpack(), we assume that unpacking
succeeded and skip unpacking this page. Later on, we run into issues
and fail booting the VM.

So far, this issue was only observed with follow-up patches where we
split large pagecache XFS folios. Maybe it can also be triggered with
shmem?

We'll cleanup s390_wiggle_split_folio() a bit next, to also return 0
if no split was required.

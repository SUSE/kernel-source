Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: skip inodes without loaded extent maps when shrinking
 extent maps
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.6
Git-commit: c6c9c4d56483d941f567eb921434c25fc6086dfa

commit c6c9c4d56483d941f567eb921434c25fc6086dfa upstream.

If there are inodes that don't have any loaded extent maps, we end up
grabbing a reference on them and later adding a delayed iput, which wakes
up the cleaner and makes it do unnecessary work. This is common when for
example the inodes were open only to run stat(2) or all their extent maps
were already released through the folio release callback
(btrfs_release_folio()) or released by a previous run of the shrinker, or
directories which never have extent maps.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: PMU: Don't save PMCR_EL0.{C,P} for the vCPU
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.24
Git-commit: f6da81f650fa47b61b847488f3938d43f90d093d

[ Upstream commit f6da81f650fa47b61b847488f3938d43f90d093d ]

Presently, when a guest writes 1 to PMCR_EL0.{C,P}, which is WO/RAZ,
KVM saves the register value, including these bits.
When userspace reads the register using KVM_GET_ONE_REG, KVM returns
the saved register value as it is (the saved value might have these
bits set).  This could result in userspace setting these bits on the
destination during migration.  Consequently, KVM may end up resetting
the vPMU counter registers (PMCCNTR_EL0 and/or PMEVCNTR<n>_EL0) to
zero on the first KVM_RUN after migration.

Fix this by not saving those bits when a guest writes 1 to those bits.

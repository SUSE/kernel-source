Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: no admin perm to list endpoints
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: cfbbd4859882a5469f6f4945937a074ee78c4b46

commit cfbbd4859882a5469f6f4945937a074ee78c4b46 upstream.

During the switch to YNL, the command to list all endpoints has been
accidentally restricted to users with admin permissions.

It looks like there are no reasons to have this restriction which makes
it harder for a user to quickly check if the endpoint list has been
correctly populated by an automated tool. Best to go back to the
previous behaviour then.

mptcp_pm_gen.c has been modified using ynl-gen-c.py:

   $ ./tools/net/ynl/ynl-gen-c.py --mode kernel \
     --spec Documentation/netlink/specs/mptcp_pm.yaml --source \
     -o net/mptcp/mptcp_pm_gen.c

The header file doesn't need to be regenerated.

Subject: [PATCH] soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Actually communicate when remote goes
 down
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.49
Git-commit: ad51126037a43c05f5f4af5eb262734e3e88ca59

commit ad51126037a43c05f5f4af5eb262734e3e88ca59 upstream.

When the pmic_glink state is UP and we either receive a protection-
domain (PD) notification indicating that the PD is going down, or that
the whole remoteproc is going down, it's expected that the pmic_glink
client instances are notified that their function has gone DOWN.

This is not what the code does, which results in the client state either
not updating, or being wrong in many cases. So let's fix the conditions.

Subject: [PATCH] clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Fix make W=n kerneldoc
 warnings
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: b99a212a7697c542b460adaa15d4a98abf8223f0

commit b99a212a7697c542b460adaa15d4a98abf8223f0 upstream.

Kernel test robot reports of kerneldoc related warnings that happen with
make W=n for "parameter or member not described".

These were caused by changes to function parameter names with
earlier commits where the kerneldoc parts were not updated.

Fixes: 49cd16bb573e ("clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Simplify register writes with dmtimer_write()")
Fixes: a6e543f61531 ("clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Move struct omap_dm_timer fields to driver")

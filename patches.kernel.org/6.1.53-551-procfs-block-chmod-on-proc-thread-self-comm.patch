Subject: [PATCH] procfs: block chmod on /proc/thread-self/comm
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: ccf61486fe1e1a48e18c638d1813cda77b3c0737

commit ccf61486fe1e1a48e18c638d1813cda77b3c0737 upstream.

Due to an oversight in commit 1b3044e39a89 ("procfs: fix pthread
cross-thread naming if !PR_DUMPABLE") in switching from REG to NOD,
chmod operations on /proc/thread-self/comm were no longer blocked as
they are on almost all other procfs files.

A very similar situation with /proc/self/environ was used to as a root
exploit a long time ago, but procfs has SB_I_NOEXEC so this is simply a
correctness issue.

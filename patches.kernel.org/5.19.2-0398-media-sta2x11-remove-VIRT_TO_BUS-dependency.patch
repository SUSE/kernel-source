Subject: [PATCH] media: sta2x11: remove VIRT_TO_BUS dependency
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: a157802359f7451ed8046b2b6dbaca187797e062

[ Upstream commit a157802359f7451ed8046b2b6dbaca187797e062 ]

This driver does not use the virt_to_bus() function, though it
depends on x86 specific fixups in the swiotlb code, which was
last rewritten in commit e380a0394c36 ("x86/PCI: sta2x11: use
default DMA address translation").

It is possible that the driver still fails to build on some
architectures that are missing CONFIG_VIRT_TO_BUS, but it is
always set on x86 machines with the STA2X11 platform enabled.

More likely though is that it was never meant to depend on
CONFIG_VIRT_TO_BUS, and the Kconfig dependency was kept from
an out-of-tree version when the driver was originally merged.

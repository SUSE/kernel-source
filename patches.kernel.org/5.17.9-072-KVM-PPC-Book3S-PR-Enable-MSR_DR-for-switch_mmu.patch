Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Enable MSR_DR for switch_mmu_context()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.9
Git-commit: ee8348496c77e3737d0a6cda307a521f2cff954f

commit ee8348496c77e3737d0a6cda307a521f2cff954f upstream.

Commit 863771a28e27 ("powerpc/32s: Convert switch_mmu_context() to C")
moved the switch_mmu_context() to C. While in principle a good idea, it
meant that the function now uses the stack. The stack is not accessible
from real mode though.

So to keep calling the function, let's turn on MSR_DR while we call it.
That way, all pointer references to the stack are handled virtually.

In addition, make sure to save/restore r12 on the stack, as it may get
clobbered by the C function.

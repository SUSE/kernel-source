Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: sdx55: fix USB wakeup interrupt types
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.15
Git-commit: d0ec3c4c11c3b30e1f2d344973b2a7bf0f986734

commit d0ec3c4c11c3b30e1f2d344973b2a7bf0f986734 upstream.

The DP/DM wakeup interrupts are edge triggered and which edge to trigger
on depends on use-case and whether a Low speed or Full/High speed device
is connected.

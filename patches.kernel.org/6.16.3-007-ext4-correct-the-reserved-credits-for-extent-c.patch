Subject: [PATCH] ext4: correct the reserved credits for extent conversion
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.3
Git-commit: 95ad8ee45cdbc321c135a2db895d48b374ef0f87

commit 95ad8ee45cdbc321c135a2db895d48b374ef0f87 upstream.

Now, we reserve journal credits for converting extents in only one page
to written state when the I/O operation is complete. This is
insufficient when large folio is enabled.

Fix this by reserving credits for converting up to one extent per block in
the largest 2MB folio, this calculation should only involve extents index
and leaf blocks, so it should not estimate too many credits.

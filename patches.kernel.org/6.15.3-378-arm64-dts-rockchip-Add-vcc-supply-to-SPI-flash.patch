Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Add vcc-supply to SPI flash on
 rk3566-rock3c
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: a706a593cb19796f31d3a888423ef1a71885ae72

[ Upstream commit a706a593cb19796f31d3a888423ef1a71885ae72 ]

As described in the radxa_rock_3c_v1400_schematic.pdf, the SPI Flash's
VCC connector is connected to VCCIO_FLASH and according to the
that same schematic, that belongs to the VCC_1V8 power source.

This fixes the following warning:

  spi-nor spi4.0: supply vcc not found, using dummy regulator

Subject: [PATCH] HID: multitouch: Add quirk for HONOR GLO-GXXX touchpad
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.69
Git-commit: 9ffccb691adb854e7b7f3ee57fbbda12ff70533f

[ Upstream commit 9ffccb691adb854e7b7f3ee57fbbda12ff70533f ]

Honor MagicBook 13 2023 has a touchpad which do not switch to the multitouch
mode until the input mode feature is written by the host.  The touchpad do
report the input mode at touchpad(3), while itself working under mouse mode. As
a workaround, it is possible to call MT_QUIRE_FORCE_GET_FEATURE to force set
feature in mt_set_input_mode for such device.

The touchpad reports as BLTP7853, which cannot retrive any useful manufacture
information on the internel by this string at present.  As the serial number of
the laptop is GLO-G52, while DMI info reports the laptop serial number as
GLO-GXXX, this workaround should applied to all models which has the GLO-GXXX.

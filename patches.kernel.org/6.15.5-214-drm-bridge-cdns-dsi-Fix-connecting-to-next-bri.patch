Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: cdns-dsi: Fix connecting to next bridge
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.5
Git-commit: 688eb4d465484bc2a3471a6a6f06f833b58c7867

commit 688eb4d465484bc2a3471a6a6f06f833b58c7867 upstream.

Fix the OF node pointer passed to the of_drm_find_bridge() call to find
the next bridge in the display chain.

The code to find the next panel (and create its panel-bridge) works
fine, but to find the next (non-panel) bridge does not.

To find the next bridge in the pipeline, we need to pass "np" - the OF
node pointer of the next entity in the devicetree chain. Passing
"of_node" to of_drm_find_bridge (which is what the code does currently)
will fetch the bridge for the cdns-dsi which is not what's required.

Fix that.

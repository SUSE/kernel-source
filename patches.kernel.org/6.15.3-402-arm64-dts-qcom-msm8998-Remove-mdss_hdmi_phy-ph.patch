Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Remove mdss_hdmi_phy phandle
 argument
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 7ebdb205d4b9dd839a93a9b8975ce8ccf86b882a

[ Upstream commit 7ebdb205d4b9dd839a93a9b8975ce8ccf86b882a ]

The node has #clock-cells = <0>, as it only provides a single clock
output.

This leads to a turbo sneaky bug, where the dt checker shows that we
have additional clocks in the array:

clock-controller@c8c0000: clocks: [[3, 0], [39, 178], [156, 1],
[156, 0], [157, 1], [157, 0], [158], [0], [0], [0], [39, 184]]
is too long

..which happens due to dtc interpreting <&mdss_hdmi_phy 0> as
<&mdss_hdmi_phy>, <0> after taking cells into account.

Remove the superfluous argument to both silence the warning and fix
the index-based lookup of subsequent entries in "clocks".

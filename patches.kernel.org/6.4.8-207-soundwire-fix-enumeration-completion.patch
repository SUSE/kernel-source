Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: fix enumeration completion
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.8
Git-commit: c40d6b3249b11d60e09d81530588f56233d9aa44

commit c40d6b3249b11d60e09d81530588f56233d9aa44 upstream.

The soundwire subsystem uses two completion structures that allow
drivers to wait for soundwire device to become enumerated on the bus and
initialised by their drivers, respectively.

The code implementing the signalling is currently broken as it does not
signal all current and future waiters and also uses the wrong
reinitialisation function, which can potentially lead to memory
corruption if there are still waiters on the queue.

Not signalling future waiters specifically breaks sound card probe
deferrals as codec drivers can not tell that the soundwire device is
already attached when being reprobed. Some codec runtime PM
implementations suffer from similar problems as waiting for enumeration
during resume can also timeout despite the device already having been
enumerated.

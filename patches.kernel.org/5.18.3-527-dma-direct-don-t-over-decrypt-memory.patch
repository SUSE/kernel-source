Subject: [PATCH] dma-direct: don't over-decrypt memory
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 4a37f3dd9a83186cb88d44808ab35b78375082c9

[ Upstream commit 4a37f3dd9a83186cb88d44808ab35b78375082c9 ]

The original x86 sev_alloc() only called set_memory_decrypted() on
memory returned by alloc_pages_node(), so the page order calculation
fell out of that logic. However, the common dma-direct code has several
potential allocators, not all of which are guaranteed to round up the
underlying allocation to a power-of-two size, so carrying over that
calculation for the encryption/decryption size was a mistake. Fix it by
rounding to a *number* of pages, rather than an order.

Until recently there was an even worse interaction with DMA_DIRECT_REMAP
where we could have ended up decrypting part of the next adjacent
vmalloc area, only averted by no architecture actually supporting both
configs at once. Don't ask how I found that one out...

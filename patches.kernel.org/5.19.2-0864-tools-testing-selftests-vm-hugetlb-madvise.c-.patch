Subject: [PATCH] tools/testing/selftests/vm/hugetlb-madvise.c: silence
 uninitialized variable warning
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 3d5367a0426da61c7cb616cc85b6239467e261dd

[ Upstream commit 3d5367a0426da61c7cb616cc85b6239467e261dd ]

This code just reads from memory without caring about the data itself.
However static checkers complain that "tmp" is never properly initialized.
Initialize it to zero and change the name to "dummy" to show that we
don't care about the value stored in it.

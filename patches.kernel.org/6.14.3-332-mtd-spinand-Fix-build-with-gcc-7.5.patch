Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spinand: Fix build with gcc < 7.5
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.3
Git-commit: 1c1fd374a2fe72b8a6dde62d3c3a9fd153e7581c

commit 1c1fd374a2fe72b8a6dde62d3c3a9fd153e7581c upstream.

__VA_OPT__ is a macro that is useful when some arguments can be present
or not to entirely skip some part of a definition. Unfortunately, it
is a too recent addition that some of the still supported old GCC
versions do not know about, and is anyway not part of C11 that is the
version used in the kernel.

Find a trick to remove this macro, typically '__VA_ARGS__ + 0' is a
workaround used in netlink.h which works very well here, as we either
expect:
- 0
- A positive value
- No value, which means the field should be 0.

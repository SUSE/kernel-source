Subject: [PATCH] wifi: iwlwifi: pcie: set state to no-FW before reset
 handshake
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.4
Git-commit: 5f05c14e7c198415abe936514a6905f8b545b63b

[ Upstream commit 5f05c14e7c198415abe936514a6905f8b545b63b ]

The reset handshake attempts to kill the firmware, and it'll go
into a pretty much dead state once we do that. However, if it
times out, then we'll attempt to dump the firmware to be able
to see why it didn't respond. During this dump, we cannot treat
it as if it was still running, since we just tried to kill it,
otherwise dumping will attempt to send a DBGC stop command. As
this command will time out, we'll go into a reset loop.

For now, fix this by setting the trans->state to say firmware
isn't running before doing the reset handshake. In the longer
term, we should clean up the way this state is handled.

It's not entirely clear but it seems likely that this issue was
introduced by my rework of the error handling, prior to that it
would've been synchronous at that point and (I think) not have
attempted to reset since it was already doing down.

Subject: [PATCH] fbdev: Make fb_release() return -ENODEV if fbdev was
 unregistered
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.7
Git-commit: aafa025c76dcc7d1a8c8f0bdefcbe4eb480b2f6a

[ Upstream commit aafa025c76dcc7d1a8c8f0bdefcbe4eb480b2f6a ]

A reference to the framebuffer device struct fb_info is stored in the file
private data, but this reference could no longer be valid and must not be
accessed directly. Instead, the file_fb_info() accessor function must be
used since it does sanity checking to make sure that the fb_info is valid.

This can happen for example if the registered framebuffer device is for a
driver that just uses a framebuffer provided by the system firmware. In
that case, the fbdev core would unregister the framebuffer device when a
real video driver is probed and ask to remove conflicting framebuffers.

The bug has been present for a long time but commit 27599aacbaef ("fbdev:
Hot-unplug firmware fb devices on forced removal") unmasked it since the
fbdev core started unregistering the framebuffers' devices associated.

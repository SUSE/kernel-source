Subject: [PATCH] perf sched: Free thread->priv using priv_destructor
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: aa9fdd106bab8c478d37eba5703c0950ad5c0d4f

[ Upstream commit aa9fdd106bab8c478d37eba5703c0950ad5c0d4f ]

In many perf sched subcommand saves priv data structure in the thread
but it forgot to free them.  As it's an opaque type with 'void *', it
needs to register that knows how to free the data.  In this case, just
regular 'free()' is fine.

Subject: [PATCH] rust: replace `clippy::dbg_macro` with `disallowed_macros`
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: 8577c9dca799bd74377f7c30015d8cdc53a53ca2

commit 8577c9dca799bd74377f7c30015d8cdc53a53ca2 upstream.

Back when we used Rust 1.60.0 (before Rust was merged in the kernel),
we added `-Wclippy::dbg_macro` to the compilation flags. This worked
great with our custom `dbg!` macro (vendored from `std`, but slightly
modified to use the kernel printing facilities).

However, in the very next version, 1.61.0, it stopped working [1] since
the lint started to use a Rust diagnostic item rather than a path to find
the `dbg!` macro [1]. This behavior remains until the current nightly
(1.83.0).

Therefore, currently, the `dbg_macro` is not doing anything, which
explains why we can invoke `dbg!` in samples/rust/rust_print.rs`, as well
as why changing the `#[allow()]`s to `#[expect()]`s in `std_vendor.rs`
doctests does not work since they are not fulfilled.

One possible workaround is using `rustc_attrs` like the standard library
does. However, this is intended to be internal, and we just started
supporting several Rust compiler versions, so it is best to avoid it.

Therefore, instead, use `disallowed_macros`. It is a stable lint and
is more flexible (in that we can provide different macros), although
its diagnostic message(s) are not as nice as the specialized one (yet),
and does not allow to set different lint levels per macro/path [2].

In turn, this requires allowing the (intentional) `dbg!` use in the
sample, as one would have expected.

Finally, in a single case, the `allow` is fixed to be an inner attribute,
since otherwise it was not being applied.

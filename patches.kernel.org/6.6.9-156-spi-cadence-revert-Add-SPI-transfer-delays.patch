Subject: [PATCH] spi: cadence: revert "Add SPI transfer delays"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.9
Git-commit: 7a733e060bd20edb63b1f27f0b29cf9b184e0e8b

commit 7a733e060bd20edb63b1f27f0b29cf9b184e0e8b upstream.

The commit 855a40cd8ccc ("spi: cadence: Add SPI transfer delays") adds a
delay after each transfer into the driver's transfer_one(). However,
the delay is already done in SPI core. So this commit unnecessarily
doubles the delay amount. Revert this commit.

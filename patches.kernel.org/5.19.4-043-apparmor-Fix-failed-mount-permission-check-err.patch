Subject: [PATCH] apparmor: Fix failed mount permission check error message
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: ec240b5905bbb09a03dccffee03062cf39e38dc2

commit ec240b5905bbb09a03dccffee03062cf39e38dc2 upstream.

When the mount check fails due to a permission check failure instead
of explicitly at one of the subcomponent checks, AppArmor is reporting
a failure in the flags match. However this is not true and AppArmor
can not attribute the error at this point to any particular component,
and should only indicate the mount failed due to missing permissions.

Fixes: 2ea3ffb7782a ("apparmor: add mount mediation")

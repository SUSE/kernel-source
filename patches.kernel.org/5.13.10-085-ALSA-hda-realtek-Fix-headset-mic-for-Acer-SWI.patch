Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix headset mic for Acer SWIFT SF314-56
 (ALC256)
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.10
Git-commit: 35171fbfc0d94aa31b009bb475d156ad1941ab50

commit 35171fbfc0d94aa31b009bb475d156ad1941ab50 upstream.

The issue on Acer SWIFT SF314-56 is that headset microphone doesn't work.
The following quirk fixed headset microphone issue. The fixup was found by trial and error.
Note that the fixup of SF314-54/55 (ALC256_FIXUP_ACER_HEADSET_MIC) was not successful on my SF314-56.

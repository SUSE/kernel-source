Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: ti: omap: Fix noisy serial with overrun-throttle-ms
 for mapphone
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.60
Git-commit: 5ad37b5e30433afa7a5513e3eb61f69fa0976785

[ Upstream commit 5ad37b5e30433afa7a5513e3eb61f69fa0976785 ]

On mapphone devices we may get lots of noise on the micro-USB port in debug
uart mode until the phy-cpcap-usb driver probes. Let's limit the noise by
using overrun-throttle-ms.

Note that there is also a related separate issue where the charger cable
connected may cause random sysrq requests until phy-cpcap-usb probes that
still remains.

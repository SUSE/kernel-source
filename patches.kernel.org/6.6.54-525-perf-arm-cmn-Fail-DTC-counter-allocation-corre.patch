Subject: [PATCH] perf/arm-cmn: Fail DTC counter allocation correctly
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.54
Git-commit: 1892fe103c3a20fced306c8dafa74f7f6d4ea0a3

commit 1892fe103c3a20fced306c8dafa74f7f6d4ea0a3 upstream.

Calling arm_cmn_event_clear() before all DTC indices are allocated is
wrong, and can lead to arm_cmn_event_add() erroneously clearing live
counters from full DTCs where allocation fails. Since the DTC counters
are only updated by arm_cmn_init_counter() after all DTC and DTM
allocations succeed, nothing actually needs cleaning up in this case
anyway, and it should just return directly as it did before.

Fixes: 7633ec2c262f ("perf/arm-cmn: Rework DTC counters (again)")

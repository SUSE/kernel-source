Subject: [PATCH] spi: intel-pci: Add support for Arrow Lake SPI serial flash
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: 8afe3c7fcaf72fca1e7d3dab16a5b7f4201ece17

[ Upstream commit 8afe3c7fcaf72fca1e7d3dab16a5b7f4201ece17 ]

This adds the PCI ID of the Arrow Lake and Meteor Lake-S PCH SPI serial
flash controller. This one supports all the necessary commands Linux
SPI-NOR stack requires.

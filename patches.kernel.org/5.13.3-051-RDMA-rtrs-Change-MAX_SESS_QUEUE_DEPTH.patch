Subject: [PATCH] RDMA/rtrs: Change MAX_SESS_QUEUE_DEPTH
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.3
Git-commit: 3a98ea7041b7d18ac356da64823c2ba2f8391b3e

[ Upstream commit 3a98ea7041b7d18ac356da64823c2ba2f8391b3e ]

Max IB immediate data size is 2^28 (MAX_IMM_PAYL_BITS)
and the minimum chunk size is 4096 (2^12).
Therefore the maximum sess_queue_depth is 65536 (2^16).

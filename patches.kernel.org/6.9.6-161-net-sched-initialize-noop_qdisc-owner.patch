Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: initialize noop_qdisc owner
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.6
Git-commit: 44180feaccf266d9b0b28cc4ceaac019817deb5c

[ Upstream commit 44180feaccf266d9b0b28cc4ceaac019817deb5c ]

When the noop_qdisc owner isn't initialized, then it will be 0,
so packets will erroneously be regarded as having been subject
to recursion as long as only CPU 0 queues them. For non-SMP,
that's all packets, of course. This causes a change in what's
reported to userspace, normally noop_qdisc would drop packets
silently, but with this change the syscall returns -ENOBUFS if
RECVERR is also set on the socket.

Fix this by initializing the owner field to -1, just like it
would be for dynamically allocated qdiscs by qdisc_alloc().

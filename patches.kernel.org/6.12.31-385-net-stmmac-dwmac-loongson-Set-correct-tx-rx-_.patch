Subject: [PATCH] net: stmmac: dwmac-loongson: Set correct {tx,rx}_fifo_size
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 8dbf0c7556454b52af91bae305ca71500c31495c

[ Upstream commit 8dbf0c7556454b52af91bae305ca71500c31495c ]

Now for dwmac-loongson {tx,rx}_fifo_size are uninitialised, which means
zero. This means dwmac-loongson doesn't support changing MTU because in
stmmac_change_mtu() it requires the fifo size be no less than MTU. Thus,
set the correct tx_fifo_size and rx_fifo_size for it (16KB multiplied by
queue counts).

Here {tx,rx}_fifo_size is initialised with the initial value (also the
maximum value) of {tx,rx}_queues_to_use. So it will keep as 16KB if we
don't change the queue count, and will be larger than 16KB if we change
(decrease) the queue count. However stmmac_change_mtu() still work well
with current logic (MTU cannot be larger than 16KB for stmmac).

Note: the Fixes tag picked here is the oldest commit and key commit of
the dwmac-loongson series "stmmac: Add Loongson platform support".

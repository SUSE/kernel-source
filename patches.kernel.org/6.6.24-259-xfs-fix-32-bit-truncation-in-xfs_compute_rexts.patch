Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix 32-bit truncation in xfs_compute_rextslog
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.24
Git-commit: cf8f0e6c1429be7652869059ea44696b72d5b726

commit cf8f0e6c1429be7652869059ea44696b72d5b726 upstream.

It's quite reasonable that some customer somewhere will want to
configure a realtime volume with more than 2^32 extents.  If they try to
do this, the highbit32() call will truncate the upper bits of the
xfs_rtbxlen_t and produce the wrong value for rextslog.  This in turn
causes the rsumlevels to be wrong, which results in a realtime summary
file that is the wrong length.  Fix that.

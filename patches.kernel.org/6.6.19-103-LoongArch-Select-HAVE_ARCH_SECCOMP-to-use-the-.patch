Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: Select HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP to use the common SECCOMP
 menu
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: 6b79ecd084c99b31c8b4d0beda08893716d5558e

[ Upstream commit 6b79ecd084c99b31c8b4d0beda08893716d5558e ]

LoongArch missed the refactoring made by commit 282a181b1a0d ("seccomp:
Move config option SECCOMP to arch/Kconfig") because LoongArch was not
mainlined at that time.

The 'depends on PROC_FS' statement is stale as described in that commit.
Select HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP, and remove the duplicated config entry.

Subject: [PATCH] media: camss: Do not attach an already attached power domain
 on MSM8916 platform
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 3d658980e6dac2af6a024fdb6ded3d7bc44dc9ff

[ Upstream commit 3d658980e6dac2af6a024fdb6ded3d7bc44dc9ff ]

The change to dynamically allocated power domains neglected a case of
CAMSS on MSM8916 platform, where a single VFE power domain is neither
attached, linked or managed in runtime in any way explicitly.

This is a special case and it shall be kept as is, because the power
domain management is done outside of the driver, and it's very different
in comparison to all other platforms supported by CAMSS.

Fixes: 6b1814e26989 ("media: camss: Allocate power domain resources dynamically")

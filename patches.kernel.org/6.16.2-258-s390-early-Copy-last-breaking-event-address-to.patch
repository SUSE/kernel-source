Subject: [PATCH] s390/early: Copy last breaking event address to pt_regs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: 7cf636c99b257c1b4b12066ab34fd5f06e8d892f

[ Upstream commit 7cf636c99b257c1b4b12066ab34fd5f06e8d892f ]

In case of an early crash the early program check handler also prints the
last breaking event address which is contained within the pt_regs
structure. However it is not initialized, and therefore a more or less
random value is printed in case of a crash.

Copy the last breaking event address from lowcore to pt_regs in case of an
early program check to address this. This also makes it easier to analyze
early crashes.

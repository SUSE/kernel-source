Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: Add '-fno-builtin-wcslen'
References: bsc#1234429

commit 84ffc79bfbf70c779e60218563f2f3ad45288671 upstream.

A recent optimization change in LLVM [1] aims to transform certain loop
idioms into calls to strlen() or wcslen(). This change transforms the
first while loop in UniStrcat() into a call to wcslen(), breaking the
build when UniStrcat() gets inlined into alloc_path_with_tree_prefix():

  ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: wcslen
  >>> referenced by nls_ucs2_utils.h:54 (fs/smb/client/../../nls/nls_ucs2_utils.h:54)
  >>>               vmlinux.o:(alloc_path_with_tree_prefix)
  >>> referenced by nls_ucs2_utils.h:54 (fs/smb/client/../../nls/nls_ucs2_utils.h:54)
  >>>               vmlinux.o:(alloc_path_with_tree_prefix)

Disable this optimization with '-fno-builtin-wcslen', which prevents the
compiler from assuming that wcslen() is available in the kernel's C
library.

[ More to the point - it's not that we couldn't implement wcslen(), it's
  that this isn't an optimization at all in the context of the kernel.

  Replacing a simple inlined loop with a function call to the same loop
  is just stupid and pointless if you don't have long strings and fancy
  libraries with vectorization support etc.

  For the regular 'strlen()' cases, we want the compiler to do this in
  order to handle the trivial case of constant strings. And we do have
  optimized versions of 'strlen()' on some architectures. But for
  wcslen? Just no.    - Linus ]

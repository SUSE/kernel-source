Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: switch from lz4c to lz4 for compression
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: e397a603e49cc7c7c113fad9f55a09637f290c34

commit e397a603e49cc7c7c113fad9f55a09637f290c34 upstream.

Replace lz4c with lz4 for kernel image compression.
Although lz4 and lz4c are functionally similar, lz4c has been deprecated
upstream since 2018. Since as early as Ubuntu 16.04 and Fedora 25, lz4
and lz4c have been packaged together, making it safe to update the
requirement from lz4c to lz4.

Consequently, some distributions and build systems, such as OpenEmbedded,
have fully transitioned to using lz4. OpenEmbedded core adopted this
change in commit fe167e082cbd ("bitbake.conf: require lz4 instead of
lz4c"), causing compatibility issues when building the mainline kernel
in the latest OpenEmbedded environment, as seen in the errors below.

This change also updates the LZ4 compression commands to make it backward
compatible by replacing stdin and stdout with the '-' option, due to some
unclear reason, the stdout keyword does not work for lz4 and '-' works for
both. In addition, this modifies the legacy '-c1' with '-9' which is also
compatible with both. This fixes the mainline kernel build failures with
the latest master OpenEmbedded builds associated with the mentioned
compatibility issues.

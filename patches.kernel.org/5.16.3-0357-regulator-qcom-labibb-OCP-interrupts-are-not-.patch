Subject: [PATCH] regulator: qcom-labibb: OCP interrupts are not a failure
 while disabled
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.3
Git-commit: d27bb69dc83f00f86a830298c967052cded6e784

[ Upstream commit d27bb69dc83f00f86a830298c967052cded6e784 ]

Receiving the Over-Current Protection interrupt while the regulator is
disabled does not count as unhandled/failure (IRQ_NONE, or 0 as it were)
but a "fake event", usually due to inrush as the is regulator about to
be enabled.

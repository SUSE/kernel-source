Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8976: Add and provide xo clk to rpmcc
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.2
Git-commit: 4a2c9b9e1215c557c17a48e3fabe9b1674c1d608

[ Upstream commit 4a2c9b9e1215c557c17a48e3fabe9b1674c1d608 ]

In order for consumers of RPMCC XO clock to probe successfully
their parent needs to be feed with reference clock to obtain proper rate,
add fixed xo-board clock and supply it to rpmcc to make consumers happy.
Frequency setting is left per board basis just like on other recent trees.

Fixes: ff7f6d34ca07 ("arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for SONY Xperia X/X Compact")

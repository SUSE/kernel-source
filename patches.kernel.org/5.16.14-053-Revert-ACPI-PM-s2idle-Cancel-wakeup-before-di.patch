Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ACPI: PM: s2idle: Cancel wakeup before dispatching EC
 GPE"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.14
Git-commit: dc0075ba7f387fe4c48a8c674b11ab6f374a6acc

This reverts commit 4287509b4d21e34dc49266c6239920811e189e40 which is
commit dc0075ba7f387fe4c48a8c674b11ab6f374a6acc upstream.

It's been reported to cause problems with a number of Fedora and Arch
Linux users, so drop it for now until that is resolved.

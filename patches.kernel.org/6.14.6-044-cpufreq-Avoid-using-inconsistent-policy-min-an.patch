Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: Avoid using inconsistent policy->min and policy->max
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.6
Git-commit: 7491cdf46b5cbdf123fc84fbe0a07e9e3d7b7620

commit 7491cdf46b5cbdf123fc84fbe0a07e9e3d7b7620 upstream.

Since cpufreq_driver_resolve_freq() can run in parallel with
cpufreq_set_policy() and there is no synchronization between them,
the former may access policy->min and policy->max while the latter
is updating them and it may see intermediate values of them due
to the way the update is carried out.  Also the compiler is free
to apply any optimizations it wants both to the stores in
cpufreq_set_policy() and to the loads in cpufreq_driver_resolve_freq()
which may result in additional inconsistencies.

To address this, use WRITE_ONCE() when updating policy->min and
policy->max in cpufreq_set_policy() and use READ_ONCE() for reading
them in cpufreq_driver_resolve_freq().  Moreover, rearrange the update
in cpufreq_set_policy() to avoid storing intermediate values in
policy->min and policy->max with the help of the observation that
their new values are expected to be properly ordered upfront.

Also modify cpufreq_driver_resolve_freq() to take the possible reverse
ordering of policy->min and policy->max, which may happen depending on
the ordering of operations when this function and cpufreq_set_policy()
run concurrently, into account by always honoring the max when it
turns out to be less than the min (in case it comes from thermal
throttling or similar).

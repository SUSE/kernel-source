Subject: [PATCH] memstick: core: Zero initialize id_reg in
 h_memstick_read_dev_id()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.40
Git-commit: 21b34a3a204ed616373a12ec17dc127ebe51eab3

commit 21b34a3a204ed616373a12ec17dc127ebe51eab3 upstream.

A new warning in clang [1] points out that id_reg is uninitialized then
passed to memstick_init_req() as a const pointer:

  drivers/memstick/core/memstick.c:330:59: error: variable 'id_reg' is uninitialized when passed as a const pointer argument here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized-const-pointer]
    330 |                 memstick_init_req(&card->current_mrq, MS_TPC_READ_REG, &id_reg,
        |                                                                         ^~~~~~

Commit de182cc8e882 ("drivers/memstick/core/memstick.c: avoid -Wnonnull
warning") intentionally passed this variable uninitialized to avoid an
-Wnonnull warning from a NULL value that was previously there because
id_reg is never read from the call to memstick_init_req() in
h_memstick_read_dev_id(). Just zero initialize id_reg to avoid the
warning, which is likely happening in the majority of builds using
modern compilers that support '-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero'.

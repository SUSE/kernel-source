Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx7d: Fix coresight funnel ports
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.16
Git-commit: 0d4ac04fa7c3f6dc263dba6f575a2ec7a2d4eca8

[ Upstream commit 0d4ac04fa7c3f6dc263dba6f575a2ec7a2d4eca8 ]

imx7d uses two ports for 'in-ports', so the syntax port@<num> has to
be used. imx7d has both port and port@1 nodes present, raising these
error:
funnel@30041000: in-ports: More than one condition true in oneOf schema
funnel@30041000: Unevaluated properties are not allowed
('in-ports' was unexpected)

Fix this by also using port@0 for imx7s as well.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/imagination: Fix kernel crash when hard resetting the GPU
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.39
Git-commit: d38376b3ee48d073c64e75e150510d7e6b4b04f7

commit d38376b3ee48d073c64e75e150510d7e6b4b04f7 upstream.

The GPU hard reset sequence calls pm_runtime_force_suspend() and
pm_runtime_force_resume(), which according to their documentation should
only be used during system-wide PM transitions to sleep states.

The main issue though is that depending on some internal runtime PM
state as seen by pm_runtime_force_suspend() (whether the usage count is
<= 1), pm_runtime_force_resume() might not resume the device unless
needed. If that happens, the runtime PM resume callback
pvr_power_device_resume() is not called, the GPU clocks are not
re-enabled, and the kernel crashes on the next attempt to access GPU
registers as part of the power-on sequence.

Replace calls to pm_runtime_force_suspend() and
pm_runtime_force_resume() with direct calls to the driver's runtime PM
callbacks, pvr_power_device_suspend() and pvr_power_device_resume(),
to ensure clocks are re-enabled and avoid the kernel crash.

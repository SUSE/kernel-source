Subject: [PATCH] clocksource/drivers/imx-tpm: Fix next event not taking effect
 sometime
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.10
Git-commit: 3d5c2f8e75a55cfb11a85086c71996af0354a1fb

commit 3d5c2f8e75a55cfb11a85086c71996af0354a1fb upstream.

The value written into the TPM CnV can only be updated into the hardware
when the counter increases. Additional writes to the CnV write buffer are
ignored until the register has been updated. Therefore, we need to check
if the CnV has been updated before continuing. This may require waiting for
1 counter cycle in the worst case.

References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit 33e9032a1875bb1aee3c68a4540f5a577ff44130 ]

Add the missing regulator supplies to the ADV7533 HDMI bridge to fix
the following dtbs_check warnings. They are all also supplied by
pm8916_l6 so there is no functional difference.

apq8016-sbc.dtb: bridge@39: 'dvdd-supply' is a required property
apq8016-sbc.dtb: bridge@39: 'pvdd-supply' is a required property
apq8016-sbc.dtb: bridge@39: 'a2vdd-supply' is a required property
        from schema display/bridge/adi,adv7533.yaml

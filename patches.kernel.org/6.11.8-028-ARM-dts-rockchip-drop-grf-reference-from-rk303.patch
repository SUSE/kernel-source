Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rockchip: drop grf reference from rk3036 hdmi
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: 1580ccb6ed9dc76b8ff3e2d8912e8215c8b0fa6d

[ Upstream commit 1580ccb6ed9dc76b8ff3e2d8912e8215c8b0fa6d ]

Neither the binding nor the driver implementation specify/use the grf
reference provided in the rk3036. And neither does the newer rk3128
user of the hdmi controller. So drop the rockchip,grf property.

Subject: [PATCH] sched/psi: Fix possible missing or delayed pending event
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: e38f89af6a13e895805febd3a329a13ab7e66fa4

[ Upstream commit e38f89af6a13e895805febd3a329a13ab7e66fa4 ]

When a pending event exists and growth is less than the threshold, the
current logic is to skip this trigger without generating event. However,
from e6df4ead85d9 ("psi: fix possible trigger missing in the window"),
our purpose is to generate event as long as pending event exists and the
rate meets the limit, no matter what growth is.
This patch handles this case properly.

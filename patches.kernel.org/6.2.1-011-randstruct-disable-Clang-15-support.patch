Subject: [PATCH] randstruct: disable Clang 15 support
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.1
Git-commit: 78f7a3fd6dc66cb788c21d7705977ed13c879351

commit 78f7a3fd6dc66cb788c21d7705977ed13c879351 upstream.

The randstruct support released in Clang 15 is unsafe to use due to a
bug that can cause miscompilations: "-frandomize-layout-seed
inconsistently randomizes all-function-pointers structs"
(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60349).  It has been fixed
on the Clang 16 release branch, so add a Clang version check.

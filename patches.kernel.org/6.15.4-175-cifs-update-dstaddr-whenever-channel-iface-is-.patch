Subject: [PATCH] cifs: update dstaddr whenever channel iface is updated
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: c1846893991f3b4ec8a0cc12219ada153f0814d6

commit c1846893991f3b4ec8a0cc12219ada153f0814d6 upstream.

When the server interface info changes (more common in clustered
servers like Azure Files), the per-channel iface gets updated.
However, this did not update the corresponding dstaddr. As a result
these channels will still connect (or try connecting) to older addresses.

Fixes: b54034a73baf ("cifs: during reconnect, update interface if necessary")

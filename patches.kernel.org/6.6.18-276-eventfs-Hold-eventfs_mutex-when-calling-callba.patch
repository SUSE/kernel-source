Subject: [PATCH] eventfs: Hold eventfs_mutex when calling callback functions
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.18
Git-commit: 44365329f8219fc379097c2c9a75ff53f123764f

commit 44365329f8219fc379097c2c9a75ff53f123764f upstream.

The callback function that is used to create inodes and dentries is not
protected by anything and the data that is passed to it could become
stale. After eventfs_remove_dir() is called by the tracing system, it is
free to remove the events that are associated to that directory.
Unfortunately, that means the callbacks must not be called after that.

     CPU0				CPU1
     ----				----
 eventfs_root_lookup() {
				 eventfs_remove_dir() {
				      mutex_lock(&event_mutex);
				      ei->is_freed = set;
				      mutex_unlock(&event_mutex);
				 }
				 kfree(event_call);

    for (...) {
      entry = &ei->entries[i];
      r = entry->callback() {
          call = data;		// call == event_call above
          if (call->flags ...)

 [ USE AFTER FREE BUG ]

The safest way to protect this is to wrap the callback with:

 mutex_lock(&eventfs_mutex);
 if (!ei->is_freed)
     r = entry->callback();
 else
     r = -1;
 mutex_unlock(&eventfs_mutex);

This will make sure that the callback will not be called after it is
freed. But now it needs to be known that the callback is called while
holding internal eventfs locks, and that it must not call back into the
eventfs / tracefs system. There's no reason it should anyway, but document
that as well.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: apq8074-dragonboard: Set DMA as remotely
 controlled
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: e60c230588d88036f974cec7e93361e2c4f62226

[ Upstream commit e60c230588d88036f974cec7e93361e2c4f62226 ]

Add the qcom,controlled-remotely property for the blsp2_bam
controller node. This board requires this, otherwise the board stalls
during the boot for some reason (most probably because TZ mishandles the
protection error and keeps on looping somewhere inside).

Fixes: 62bc81792223 dts: msm8974: Add blsp2_bam dma node

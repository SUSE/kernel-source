Subject: [PATCH] virtio: VIRTIO_HARDEN_NOTIFICATION is broken
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: ebe797f25f68f28581f46a9cb9c1997ac15c39a0

commit ebe797f25f68f28581f46a9cb9c1997ac15c39a0 upstream.

This option doesn't really work and breaks too many drivers.
Not yet sure what's the right thing to do, for now
let's make sure randconfig isn't broken by this.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: apq8064: correct XOADC register address
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 554557542e709e190eff8a598f0cde02647d533a

[ Upstream commit 554557542e709e190eff8a598f0cde02647d533a ]

The XOADC is present at the address 0x197 rather than just 197. It
doesn't change a lot (since the driver hardcodes all register
addresses), but the DT should present correct address anyway.

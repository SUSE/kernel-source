Subject: [PATCH] thermal/drivers/qcom: Make LMH select QCOM_SCM
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.53
Git-commit: 57eda47bd14b0c2876f2db42e757c57b7a671965

[ Upstream commit 57eda47bd14b0c2876f2db42e757c57b7a671965 ]

The QCOM_SCM symbol is not user-visible, so it makes little sense to
depend on it. Make LMH driver select QCOM_SCM as all other drivers do
and, as the dependecy is now correctly handled, enable || COMPILE_TEST
in order to include the driver into broader set of build tests.

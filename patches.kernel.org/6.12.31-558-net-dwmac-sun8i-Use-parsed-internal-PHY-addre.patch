Subject: [PATCH] net: dwmac-sun8i: Use parsed internal PHY address instead of
 1
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 47653e4243f2b0a26372e481ca098936b51ec3a8

[ Upstream commit 47653e4243f2b0a26372e481ca098936b51ec3a8 ]

While the MDIO address of the internal PHY on Allwinner sun8i chips is
generally 1, of_mdio_parse_addr is used to cleanly parse the address
from the device-tree instead of hardcoding it.

A commit reworking the code ditched the parsed value and hardcoded the
value 1 instead, which didn't really break anything but is more fragile
and not future-proof.

Restore the initial behavior using the parsed address returned from the
helper.

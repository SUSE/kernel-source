Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stihxxx-b2120: fix polarity of reset line of tsin0
 port
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.15
Git-commit: 4722dd4029c63f10414ffd8d3ffdd6c748391cd7

[ Upstream commit 4722dd4029c63f10414ffd8d3ffdd6c748391cd7 ]

According to c8sectpfe driver code we first drive reset line low and
then high to reset the port, therefore the reset line is supposed to
be annotated as "active low". This will be important when we convert
the driver to gpiod API.

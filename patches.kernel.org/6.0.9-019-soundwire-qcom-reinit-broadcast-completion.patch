Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: qcom: reinit broadcast completion
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.9
Git-commit: f936fa7a954b262cb3908bbc8f01ba19dfaf9fbf

[ Upstream commit f936fa7a954b262cb3908bbc8f01ba19dfaf9fbf ]

For some reason we never reinit the broadcast completion, there is a
danger that broadcast commands could be treated as completed by driver
from previous complete status.
Fix this by reinitializing the completion before sending a broadcast command.

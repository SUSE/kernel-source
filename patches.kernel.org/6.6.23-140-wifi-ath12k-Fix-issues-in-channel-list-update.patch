Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath12k: Fix issues in channel list update
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: 67a48d937fac917947540c9f89630d472cd61fcb

[ Upstream commit 67a48d937fac917947540c9f89630d472cd61fcb ]

Currently, the logic used to select the 6 GHz band is incorrect,
which may cause 6 GHz supported channels to not be updated properly.
This is because the 6 GHz Max frequency supported by the driver is
being compared to the Max frequency supported on the board. If in
some cases, the 6 GHz Max frequency supported on the board is less
than the defined 6 GHz Max frequency, all 6 GHz channels are disabled.
To address this, compare the max frequency supported by the board to
the defined 6 GHz Minimum frequency by the driver.

Similarly, when a dual mac card supports both 6 GHz and 5 GHz radios,
if the 5 GHz radio gets enumerated first before 6 GHz, the checks in
ath12k_mac_setup_channels_rates() can cause the 5 GHz channels which
were enabled earlier to get disabled when the 6 GHz channel list is
updated. This is because the Min 6 GHz frequency defined in the driver
is 5945 MHz, which should be 5925 MHz since channel 2 is not considered
currently, but the firmware can pass 5925 MHz as the minimum.
Hence, update the Min frequency supported by the driver to 5925 MHz.

In addition, ensure that the channel list update to firmware updates
only the channels that the current radio (ar) supports rather than
considering the wiphy support. This would be required when multiple pdevs
are supported in a wiphy and they support different ranges of frequencies
or bands as in single wiphy support.

Subject: [PATCH] can: m_can: m_can_close(): stop clocks after device has been
 shut down
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.2
Git-commit: 2c09b50efcad985cf920ca88baa9aa52b1999dcc

[ Upstream commit 2c09b50efcad985cf920ca88baa9aa52b1999dcc ]

After calling m_can_stop() an interrupt may be pending or NAPI might
still be executed. This means the driver might still touch registers
of the IP core after the clocks have been disabled. This is not good
practice and might lead to aborts depending on the SoC integration.

To avoid these potential problems, make m_can_close() symmetric to
m_can_open(), i.e. stop the clocks at the end, right before shutting
down the transceiver.

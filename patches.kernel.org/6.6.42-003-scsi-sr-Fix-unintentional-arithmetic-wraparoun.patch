[ Upstream commit 9fad9d560af5c654bb38e0b07ee54a4e9acdc5cd ]

Running syzkaller with the newly reintroduced signed integer overflow
sanitizer produces this report:

Historically, the signed integer overflow sanitizer did not work in the
kernel due to its interaction with `-fwrapv` but this has since been
changed [1] in the newest version of Clang. It was re-enabled in the kernel
with Commit 557f8c582a9b ("ubsan: Reintroduce signed overflow sanitizer").

Firstly, let's change the type of "speed" to unsigned long as
sr_select_speed()'s only caller passes in an unsigned long anyways.

$ git grep '\.select_speed'
|	drivers/scsi/sr.c:      .select_speed           = sr_select_speed,
...
|	static int cdrom_ioctl_select_speed(struct cdrom_device_info *cdi,
|	                unsigned long arg)
|	{
|	        ...
|	        return cdi->ops->select_speed(cdi, arg);
|	}

Next, let's add an extra check to make sure we don't exceed 0xffff/177
(350) since 0xffff is the max speed. This has two benefits: 1) we deal
with integer overflow before it happens and 2) we properly respect the
max speed of 0xffff. There are some "magic" numbers here but I did not
want to change more than what was necessary.

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: allow to find by goal if EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY is set
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: 01e4ca29451760b9ac10b4cdc231c52150842643

[ Upstream commit 01e4ca29451760b9ac10b4cdc231c52150842643 ]

If EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY is set, ext4_mb_regular_allocator will only
allocate blocks from ext4_mb_find_by_goal. Allow to find by goal in
ext4_mb_find_by_goal if EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY is set or allocation
with EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY set will always fail.

EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY is not used at all, so the problem is not
found for now.

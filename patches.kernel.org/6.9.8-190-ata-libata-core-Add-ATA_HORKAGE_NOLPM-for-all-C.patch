Subject: [PATCH] ata: libata-core: Add ATA_HORKAGE_NOLPM for all Crucial BX
 SSD1 models
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.8
Git-commit: 1066fe825987da007669d7c25306b4dbb50bd7dd

commit 1066fe825987da007669d7c25306b4dbb50bd7dd upstream.

We got another report that CT1000BX500SSD1 does not work with LPM.

If you look in libata-core.c, we have six different Crucial devices that
are marked with ATA_HORKAGE_NOLPM. This model would have been the seventh.
(This quirk is used on Crucial models starting with both CT* and
Crucial_CT*)

It is obvious that this vendor does not have a great history of supporting
LPM properly, therefore, add the ATA_HORKAGE_NOLPM quirk for all Crucial
BX SSD1 models.

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: use consistent uid/gid when grabbing dquots for inodes
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.68
Git-commit: 24a4e1cb322e2bf0f3a1afd1978b610a23aa8f36

commit 24a4e1cb322e2bf0f3a1afd1978b610a23aa8f36 upstream.

I noticed that callers of xfs_qm_vop_dqalloc use the following code to
compute the anticipated uid of the new file:

	mapped_fsuid(idmap, &init_user_ns);

whereas the VFS uses a slightly different computation for actually
assigning i_uid:

	mapped_fsuid(idmap, i_user_ns(inode));

Technically, these are not the same things.  According to Christian
Brauner, the only time that inode->i_sb->s_user_ns != &init_user_ns is
when the filesystem was mounted in a new mount namespace by an
unpriviledged user.  XFS does not allow this, which is why we've never
seen bug reports about quotas being incorrect or the uid checks in
xfs_qm_vop_create_dqattach tripping debug assertions.

However, this /is/ a logic bomb, so let's make the code consistent.

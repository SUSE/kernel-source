Subject: [PATCH] x86/pat: Restructure _lookup_address_cpa()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: 02eac06b820c3eae73e5736ae62f986d37fed991

[ Upstream commit 02eac06b820c3eae73e5736ae62f986d37fed991 ]

Modify _lookup_address_cpa() to no longer use lookup_address(), but
only lookup_address_in_pgd().

This is done in preparation of using lookup_address_in_pgd_attr().

No functional change intended.

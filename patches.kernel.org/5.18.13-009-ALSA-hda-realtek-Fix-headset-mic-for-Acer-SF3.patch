Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix headset mic for Acer SF313-51
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.13
Git-commit: 5f3fe25e70559fa3b096ab17e13316c93ddb7020

commit 5f3fe25e70559fa3b096ab17e13316c93ddb7020 upstream.

The issue on Acer SWIFT SF313-51 is that headset microphone
doesn't work. The following quirk fixed headset microphone issue.
Note that the fixup of SF314-54/55 (ALC256_FIXUP_ACER_HEADSET_MIC)
was not successful on my SF313-51.

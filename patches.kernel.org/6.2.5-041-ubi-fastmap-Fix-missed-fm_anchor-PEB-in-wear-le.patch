Subject: [PATCH] ubi: fastmap: Fix missed fm_anchor PEB in wear-leveling after
 disabling fastmap
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.5
Git-commit: 76f9476ece445a07aeb72df9d896cd563fb5b50f

[ Upstream commit 76f9476ece445a07aeb72df9d896cd563fb5b50f ]

After disabling fastmap(ubi->fm_disabled = 1), fastmap won't be updated,
fm_anchor PEB is missed being scheduled for erasing. Besides, fm_anchor
PEB may have smallest erase count, it doesn't participate wear-leveling.
The difference of erase count between fm_anchor PEB and other PEBs will
be larger and larger later on.

In which situation fastmap can be disabled? Initially, we have an UBI
image with fastmap. Then the image will be atttached without module
parameter 'fm_autoconvert', ubi turns to full scanning mode in one
random attaching process(eg. bad fastmap caused by powercut), ubi
fastmap is disabled since then.

Fix it by not getting fm_anchor if fastmap is disabled in
ubi_refill_pools().

Fetch a reproducer in [Link].

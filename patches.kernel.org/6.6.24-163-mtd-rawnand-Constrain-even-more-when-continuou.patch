Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: Constrain even more when continuous reads are
 enabled
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.24
Git-commit: 78ffbefba8d7822b232585570b293de5bc397da6

[ Upstream commit 78ffbefba8d7822b232585570b293de5bc397da6 ]

As a matter of fact, continuous reads require additional handling at the
operation level in order for them to work properly. The core helpers do
have this additional logic now, but any time a controller implements its
own page helper, this extra logic is "lost". This means we need another
level of per-controller driver checks to ensure they can leverage
continuous reads. This is for now unsupported, so in order to ensure
continuous reads are enabled only when fully using the core page
helpers, we need to add more initial checks.

Also, as performance is not relevant during raw accesses, we also
prevent these from enabling the feature.

This should solve the issue seen with controllers such as the STM32 FMC2
when in sequencer mode. In this case, the continuous read feature would
be enabled but not leveraged, and most importantly not disabled, leading
to further operations to fail.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: HED: Always initialize before evged
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: cccf6ee090c8c133072d5d5b52ae25f3bc907a16

[ Upstream commit cccf6ee090c8c133072d5d5b52ae25f3bc907a16 ]

When the HED driver is built-in, it initializes after evged because they
both are at the same initcall level, so the initialization ordering
depends on the Makefile order.  However, this prevents RAS records
coming in between the evged driver initialization and the HED driver
initialization from being handled.

If the number of such RAS records is above the APEI HEST error source
number, the HEST resources may be exhausted, and that may affect
subsequent RAS error reporting.

To fix this issue, change the initcall level of HED to subsys_initcall
and prevent the driver from being built as a module by changing ACPI_HED
in Kconfig from "tristate" to "bool".

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: reinsert BGs failed to reclaim
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.4
Git-commit: 7e27180994383b7c741ad87749db01e4989a02ba

commit 7e27180994383b7c741ad87749db01e4989a02ba upstream.

The reclaim process can temporarily fail. For example, if the space is
getting tight, it fails to make the block group read-only. If there are no
further writes on that block group, the block group will never get back to
the reclaim list, and the BG never gets reclaimed. In a certain workload,
we can leave many such block groups never reclaimed.

So, let's get it back to the list and give it a chance to be reclaimed.

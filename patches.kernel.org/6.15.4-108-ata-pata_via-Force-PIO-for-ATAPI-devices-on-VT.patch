Subject: [PATCH] ata: pata_via: Force PIO for ATAPI devices on VT6415/VT6330
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: d29fc02caad7f94b62d56ee1b01c954f9c961ba7

commit d29fc02caad7f94b62d56ee1b01c954f9c961ba7 upstream.

The controller has a hardware bug that can hard hang the system when
doing ATAPI DMAs without any trace of what happened. Depending on the
device attached, it can also prevent the system from booting.

In this case, the system hangs when reading the ATIP from optical media
with cdrecord -vvv -atip on an _NEC DVD_RW ND-4571A 1-01 and an
Optiarc DVD RW AD-7200A 1.06 attached to an ASRock 990FX Extreme 4,
running at UDMA/33.

The issue can be reproduced by running the same command with a cygwin
build of cdrecord on WinXP, although it requires more attempts to cause
it. The hang in that case is also resolved by forcing PIO. It doesn't
appear that VIA has produced any drivers for that OS, thus no known
workaround exists.

HDDs attached to the controller do not suffer from any DMA issues.

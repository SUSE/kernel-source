Subject: [PATCH] wifi: mac80211: remove link before AP
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.30
Git-commit: cb55e08dba3526796e35d24a6d5db4ed6dcb8a4b

[ Upstream commit cb55e08dba3526796e35d24a6d5db4ed6dcb8a4b ]

If the AP removal timer is long, we don't really want to
remove the link immediately. However, we really should do
it _before_ the AP removes it (which happens at or after
count reaches 0), so subtract 1 from the countdown when
scheduling the timer. This causes the link removal work
to run just after the beacon with value 1 is received. If
the counter is already zero, do it immediately.

This fixes an issue where we do the removal too late and
receive a beacon from the AP that's no longer associated
with the MLD, but thus removed EHT and ML elements, and
then we disconnect instead from the whole MLD, since one
of the associated APs changed mode from EHT to HE.

Fixes: 8eb8dd2ffbbb ("wifi: mac80211: Support link removal using Reconfiguration ML element")

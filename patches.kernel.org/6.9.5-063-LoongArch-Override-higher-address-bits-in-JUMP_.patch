Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: Override higher address bits in JUMP_VIRT_ADDR
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.5
Git-commit: 1098efd299ffe9c8af818425338c7f6c4f930a98

commit 1098efd299ffe9c8af818425338c7f6c4f930a98 upstream.

In JUMP_VIRT_ADDR we are performing an or calculation on address value
directly from pcaddi.

This will only work if we are currently running from direct 1:1 mapping
addresses or firmware's DMW is configured exactly same as kernel. Still,
we should not rely on such assumption.

Fix by overriding higher bits in address comes from pcaddi, so we can
get rid of or operator.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8350: correct sleep clock frequency
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: f4cc8c75cfc5d06084a31da2ff67e477565f0cae

[ Upstream commit f4cc8c75cfc5d06084a31da2ff67e477565f0cae ]

The SM8350 platform uses PMK8350 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.

Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: only compute port params in specific stream states

[ Upstream commit 62ada17a6217a50fbd1b23f10899890f56effc97 ]

Currently, sdw_compute_master_ports() is blindly called for every single
Manager runtime. However, we should not take into account the stream's
bandwidth if the stream is just allocated or already deprepared.

Subject: [PATCH] fanotify: do not allow setting dirent events in mask of
 non-dir
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.9
Git-commit: ceaf69f8eadcafb323392be88e7a5248c415d423

[ Upstream commit ceaf69f8eadcafb323392be88e7a5248c415d423 ]

Dirent events (create/delete/move) are only reported on watched
directory inodes, but in fanotify as well as in legacy inotify, it was
always allowed to set them on non-dir inode, which does not result in
any meaningful outcome.

Until kernel v5.17, dirent events in fanotify also differed from events
"on child" (e.g. FAN_OPEN) in the information provided in the event.
For example, FAN_OPEN could be set in the mask of a non-dir or the mask
of its parent and event would report the fid of the child regardless of
the marked object.
By contrast, FAN_DELETE is not reported if the child is marked and the
child fid was not reported in the events.

Since kernel v5.17, with fanotify group flag FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID, the
fid of the child is reported with dirent events, like events "on child",
which may create confusion for users expecting the same behavior as
events "on child" when setting events in the mask on a child.

The desired semantics of setting dirent events in the mask of a child
are not clear, so for now, deny this action for a group initialized
with flag FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID and for the new event FAN_RENAME.
We may relax this restriction in the future if we decide on the
semantics and implement them.

Fixes: 8cc3b1ccd930 ("fanotify: wire up FAN_RENAME event")

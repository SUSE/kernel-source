Subject: [PATCH] mm/swapfile: skip HugeTLB pages for unuse_vma
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.5
Git-commit: 7528c4fb1237512ee18049f852f014eba80bbe8d

commit 7528c4fb1237512ee18049f852f014eba80bbe8d upstream.

I got a bad pud error and lost a 1GB HugeTLB when calling swapoff.  The
problem can be reproduced by the following steps:

 1. Allocate an anonymous 1GB HugeTLB and some other anonymous memory.
 2. Swapout the above anonymous memory.
 3. run swapoff and we will get a bad pud error in kernel message:

  mm/pgtable-generic.c:42: bad pud 00000000743d215d(84000001400000e7)

We can tell that pud_clear_bad is called by pud_none_or_clear_bad in
unuse_pud_range() by ftrace.  And therefore the HugeTLB pages will never
be freed because we lost it from page table.  We can skip HugeTLB pages
for unuse_vma to fix it.

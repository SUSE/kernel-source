Subject: [PATCH] fs: better handle deep ancestor chains in is_subdir()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.42
Git-commit: 391b59b045004d5b985d033263ccba3e941a7740

[ Upstream commit 391b59b045004d5b985d033263ccba3e941a7740 ]

Jan reported that 'cd ..' may take a long time in deep directory
hierarchies under a bind-mount. If concurrent renames happen it is
possible to livelock in is_subdir() because it will keep retrying.

Change is_subdir() from simply retrying over and over to retry once and
then acquire the rename lock to handle deep ancestor chains better. The
list of alternatives to this approach were less then pleasant. Change
the scope of rcu lock to cover the whole walk while at it.

A big thanks to Jan and Linus. Both Jan and Linus had proposed
effectively the same thing just that one version ended up being slightly
more elegant.

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix simplify extent lookup in xfs_can_free_eofblocks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: 62027820eb4486f075b89ec31c1548c6cb1bb13f

commit 62027820eb4486f075b89ec31c1548c6cb1bb13f upstream.

In commit 11f4c3a53adde, we tried to simplify the extent lookup in
xfs_can_free_eofblocks so that it doesn't incur the overhead of all the
extra stuff that xfs_bmapi_read does around the iext lookup.

Unfortunately, this causes regressions on generic/603, xfs/108,
generic/219, xfs/173, generic/694, xfs/052, generic/230, and xfs/441
when always_cow is turned on.  In all cases, the regressions take the
form of alwayscow files consuming rather more space than the golden
output is expecting.  I observed that in all these cases, the cause of
the excess space usage was due to CoW fork delalloc reservations that go
beyond EOF.

For alwayscow files we allow posteof delalloc CoW reservations because
all writes go through the CoW fork.  Recall that all extents in the CoW
fork are accounted for via i_delayed_blks, which means that prior to
this patch, we'd invoke xfs_free_eofblocks on first close if anything
was in the CoW fork.  Now we don't do that.

Fix the problem by reverting the removal of the i_delayed_blks check.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dpu: Remove arbitrary limit of 1 interface in DSC
 topology
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: d245ce568929e30f650e260631f7ad14970d7c2c

[ Upstream commit d245ce568929e30f650e260631f7ad14970d7c2c ]

When DSC is enabled the number of interfaces is forced to be 1, and
documented that it is a "power-optimal" layout to use two DSC encoders
together with two Layer Mixers.  However, the same layout (two DSC
hard-slice encoders with two LMs) is also used when the display is
fed with data over two instead of one interface (common on 4k@120Hz
smartphone panels with Dual-DSI).  Solve this by simply removing the
num_intf = 1 assignment as the count is already calculated by computing
the number of physical encoders within the virtual encoder.

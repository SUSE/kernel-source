Subject: [PATCH] wifi: brcm80211: BRCM_TRACING should depend on TRACING

Patch-mainline: 6.6.60
Git-commit: b73b2069528f90ec49d5fa1010a759baa2c2be05

[ Upstream commit b73b2069528f90ec49d5fa1010a759baa2c2be05 ]

When tracing is disabled, there is no point in asking the user about
enabling Broadcom wireless device tracing.

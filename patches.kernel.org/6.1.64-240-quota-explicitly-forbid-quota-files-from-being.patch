Subject: [PATCH] quota: explicitly forbid quota files from being encrypted
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.64
Git-commit: d3cc1b0be258191d6360c82ea158c2972f8d3991

commit d3cc1b0be258191d6360c82ea158c2972f8d3991 upstream.

Since commit d7e7b9af104c ("fscrypt: stop using keyrings subsystem for
fscrypt_master_key"), xfstest generic/270 causes a WARNING when run on
f2fs with test_dummy_encryption in the mount options:

$ kvm-xfstests -c f2fs/encrypt generic/270
[...]
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2453 at fs/crypto/keyring.c:240 fscrypt_destroy_keyring+0x1f5/0x260

The cause of the WARNING is that not all encrypted inodes have been
evicted before fscrypt_destroy_keyring() is called, which violates an
assumption.  This happens because the test uses an external quota file,
which gets automatically encrypted due to test_dummy_encryption.

Encryption of quota files has never really been supported.  On ext4,
ext4_quota_read() does not decrypt the data, so encrypted quota files
are always considered invalid on ext4.  On f2fs, f2fs_quota_read() uses
the pagecache, so trying to use an encrypted quota file gets farther,
resulting in the issue described above being possible.  But this was
never intended to be possible, and there is no use case for it.

Therefore, make the quota support layer explicitly reject using
IS_ENCRYPTED inodes when quotaon is attempted.

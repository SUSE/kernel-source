Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Remove CTS/RTS configuration
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 2b96407b8f10f1d71b58cb35704eb91b8ea78db1

[ Upstream commit 2b96407b8f10f1d71b58cb35704eb91b8ea78db1 ]

For IDP variant, GPIO 20/21 is used by camera use case and camera
driver is not able acquire these GPIOs as it is acquired by UART5
driver as RTS/CTS pin.

UART5 is designed for debug UART for all the board variants of the
sc7280 chipset and RTS/CTS configuration is not required for debug
uart usecase.

Remove CTS/RTS configuration for UART5 instance and change compatible
string to debug UART.

Remove overwriting compatible property from individual target specific
file as it is not required.

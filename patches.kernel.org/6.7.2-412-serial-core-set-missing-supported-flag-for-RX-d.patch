Subject: [PATCH] serial: core: set missing supported flag for RX during TX
 GPIO

commit 1a33e33ca0e80d485458410f149265cdc0178cfa upstream.

If the RS485 feature RX-during-TX is supported by means of a GPIO set the
according supported flag. Otherwise setting this feature from userspace may
not be possible, since in uart_sanitize_serial_rs485() the passed RS485
configuration is matched against the supported features and unsupported
settings are thereby removed and thus take no effect.

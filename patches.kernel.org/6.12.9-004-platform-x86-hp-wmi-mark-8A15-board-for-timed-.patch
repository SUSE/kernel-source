Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: hp-wmi: mark 8A15 board for timed OMEN thermal
 profile

commit 032fe9b0516702599c2dd990a4703f783d5716b8 upstream.

The HP OMEN 8 (2022), corresponding to a board ID of 8A15, supports OMEN
thermal profile and requires the timed profile quirk.

Upon adding this ID to both the omen_thermal_profile_boards and
omen_timed_thermal_profile_boards, significant bump in performance can be
observed. For instance, SilverBench (https://silver.urih.com/) results
improved from ~56,000 to ~69,000, as a result of higher power draws (and
thus core frequencies) whilst under load:

Package Power:

- Before the patch: ~65W (dropping to about 55W under sustained load).
- After the patch: ~115W (dropping to about 105W under sustained load).

Core Power:

- Before: ~60W (ditto above).
- After: ~108W (ditto above).

Add 8A15 to omen_thermal_profile_boards and
omen_timed_thermal_profile_boards to improve performance.

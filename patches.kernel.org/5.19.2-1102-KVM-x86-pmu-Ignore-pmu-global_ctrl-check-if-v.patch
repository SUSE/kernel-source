Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/pmu: Ignore pmu->global_ctrl check if vPMU doesn't
 support global_ctrl
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 98defd2e17803263f49548fea930cfc974d505aa

[ Upstream commit 98defd2e17803263f49548fea930cfc974d505aa ]

MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL is introduced as part of Architecture PMU V2,
as indicated by Intel SDM 19.2.2 and the intel_is_valid_msr() function.

So in the absence of global_ctrl support, all PMCs are enabled as AMD does.

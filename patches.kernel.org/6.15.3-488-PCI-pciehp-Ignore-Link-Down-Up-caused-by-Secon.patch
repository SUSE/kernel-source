[ Upstream commit 2af781a9edc4ef5f6684c0710cc3542d9be48b31 ]

When a Secondary Bus Reset is issued at a hotplug port, it causes a Data
Link Layer State Changed event as a side effect.  On hotplug ports using
in-band presence detect, it additionally causes a Presence Detect Changed
event.

These spurious events should not result in teardown and re-enumeration of
the device in the slot.  Hence commit 2e35afaefe64 ("PCI: pciehp: Add
reset_slot() method") masked the Presence Detect Changed Enable bit in the
Slot Control register during a Secondary Bus Reset.  Commit 06a8d89af551
("PCI: pciehp: Disable link notification across slot reset") additionally
masked the Data Link Layer State Changed Enable bit.

However masking those bits only disables interrupt generation (PCIe r6.2
sec 6.7.3.1).  The events are still visible in the Slot Status register
and picked up by the IRQ handler if it runs during a Secondary Bus Reset.
This can happen if the interrupt is shared or if an unmasked hotplug event
occurs, e.g. Attention Button Pressed or Power Fault Detected.

The likelihood of this happening used to be small, so it wasn't much of a
problem in practice.  That has changed with the recent introduction of
bandwidth control in v6.13-rc1 with commit 665745f27487 ("PCI/bwctrl:
Re-add BW notification portdrv as PCIe BW controller"):

Bandwidth control shares the interrupt with PCIe hotplug.  A Secondary Bus
Reset causes a Link Bandwidth Notification, so the hotplug IRQ handler
runs, picks up the masked events and tears down the device in the slot.

As a result, Joel reports VFIO passthrough failure of a GPU, which Ilpo
root-caused to the incorrect handling of masked hotplug events.

Clearly, a more reliable way is needed to ignore spurious hotplug events.

For Downstream Port Containment, a new ignore mechanism was introduced by
commit a97396c6eb13 ("PCI: pciehp: Ignore Link Down/Up caused by DPC").
It has been working reliably for the past four years.

Adapt it for Secondary Bus Resets.

Introduce two helpers to annotate code sections which cause spurious link
changes:  pci_hp_ignore_link_change() and pci_hp_unignore_link_change()
Use those helpers in lieu of masking interrupts in the Slot Control
register.

Introduce a helper to check whether such a code section is executing
concurrently and if so, await it:  pci_hp_spurious_link_change()
Invoke the helper in the hotplug IRQ thread pciehp_ist().  Re-use the
IRQ thread's existing code which ignores DPC-induced link changes unless
the link is unexpectedly down after reset recovery or the device was
replaced during the bus reset.

That code block in pciehp_ist() was previously only executed if a Data
Link Layer State Changed event has occurred.  Additionally execute it for
Presence Detect Changed events.  That's necessary for compatibility with
PCIe r1.0 hotplug ports because Data Link Layer State Changed didn't exist
before PCIe r1.1.  DPC was added with PCIe r3.1 and thus DPC-capable
hotplug ports always support Data Link Layer State Changed events.
But the same cannot be assumed for Secondary Bus Reset, which already
existed in PCIe r1.0.

Secondary Bus Reset is only one of many causes of spurious link changes.
Others include runtime suspend to D3cold, firmware updates or FPGA
reconfiguration.  The new pci_hp_{,un}ignore_link_change() helpers may be
used by all kinds of drivers to annotate such code sections, hence their
declarations are publicly visible in <linux/pci.h>.  A case in point is
the Mellanox Ethernet driver which disables a firmware reset feature if
the Ethernet card is attached to a hotplug port, see commit 3d7a3f2612d7
("net/mlx5: Nack sync reset request when HotPlug is enabled").  Going
forward, PCIe hotplug will be able to cope gracefully with all such use
cases once the code sections are properly annotated.

The new helpers internally use two bits in struct pci_dev's priv_flags as
well as a wait_queue.  This mirrors what was done for DPC by commit
a97396c6eb13 ("PCI: pciehp: Ignore Link Down/Up caused by DPC").  That may
be insufficient if spurious link changes are caused by multiple sources
simultaneously.  An example might be a Secondary Bus Reset issued by AER
during FPGA reconfiguration.  If this turns out to happen in real life,
support for it can easily be added by replacing the PCI_LINK_CHANGING flag
with an atomic_t counter incremented by pci_hp_ignore_link_change() and
decremented by pci_hp_unignore_link_change().  Instead of awaiting a zero
PCI_LINK_CHANGING flag, the pci_hp_spurious_link_change() helper would
then simply await a zero counter.

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: Avoid hogging the CPU while polling for busy for
 mmc ioctls
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.6
Git-commit: 468108155b0f89cc08189cc33f9bacfe9da8a125

[ Upstream commit 468108155b0f89cc08189cc33f9bacfe9da8a125 ]

When __mmc_blk_ioctl_cmd() calls card_busy_detect() to verify that the
card's states moves back into transfer state, the polling with CMD13 is
done without any delays in between the commands being sent.

Rather than fixing card_busy_detect() in this regards, let's instead
convert into using the common mmc_poll_for_busy(), which also helps us to
avoid open-coding.

Subject: [PATCH] RDMA/mlx5: Fix HW counters query for non-representor devices
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.37
Git-commit: 3cc1dbfddf88dc5ecce0a75185061403b1f7352d

[ Upstream commit 3cc1dbfddf88dc5ecce0a75185061403b1f7352d ]

To get the device HW counters, a non-representor switchdev device
should use the mlx5_ib_query_q_counters() function and query all of
the available counters. While a representor device in switchdev mode
should use the mlx5_ib_query_q_counters_vport() function and query only
the Q_Counters without the PPCNT counters and congestion control counters,
since they aren't relevant for a representor device.

Currently a non-representor switchdev device skips querying the PPCNT
counters and congestion control counters, leaving them unupdated.
Fix that by properly querying those counters for non-representor devices.

Fixes: d22467a71ebe ("RDMA/mlx5: Expand switchdev Q-counters to expose representor statistics")

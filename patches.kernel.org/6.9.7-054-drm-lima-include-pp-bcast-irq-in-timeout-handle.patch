Subject: [PATCH] drm/lima: include pp bcast irq in timeout handler check
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.7
Git-commit: d8100caf40a35904d27ce446fb2088b54277997a

[ Upstream commit d8100caf40a35904d27ce446fb2088b54277997a ]

In commit 53cb55b20208 ("drm/lima: handle spurious timeouts due to high
irq latency") a check was added to detect an unexpectedly high interrupt
latency timeout.
With further investigation it was noted that on Mali-450 the pp bcast
irq may also be a trigger of race conditions against the timeout
handler, so add it to this check too.

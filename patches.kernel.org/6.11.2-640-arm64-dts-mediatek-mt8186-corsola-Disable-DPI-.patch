Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8186-corsola: Disable DPI display
 interface
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.2
Git-commit: 3079fb09ddac159bd8bb87f6f15b924e265f8d4d

commit 3079fb09ddac159bd8bb87f6f15b924e265f8d4d upstream.

The DPI display interface feeds the external display pipeline. However
the pipeline representation is currently incomplete. Efforts are still
under way to come up with a way to represent the "creative" repurposing
of the DP bridge chip's internal output mux, which is meant to support
USB type-C orientation changes, to output to one of two type-C ports.

Until that is finalized, the external display can't be fully described,
and thus won't work. Even worse, the half complete graph potentially
confuses the OS, breaking the internal display as well.

Disable the external display interface across the whole Corsola family
until the DP / USB Type-C muxing graph binding is ready.

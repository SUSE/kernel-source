Subject: [PATCH] crypto: ccp - Avoid discarding errors in
 psp_send_platform_access_msg()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: 0e8fca2f12ceb77c3a6b6f210135031f264aa612

[ Upstream commit 0e8fca2f12ceb77c3a6b6f210135031f264aa612 ]

Errors can potentially occur in the "processing" of PSP commands or
commands can be processed successfully but still return an error code in
the header.

This second case was being discarded because PSP communication worked but
the command returned an error code in the payload header.

Capture both cases and return them to the caller as -EIO for the caller
to investigate. The caller can detect the latter by looking at
`req->header->status`.

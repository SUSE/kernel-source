Subject: [PATCH] perf/x86/amd: Warn only on new bits set
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.66
Git-commit: de20037e1b3c2f2ca97b8c12b8c7bca8abd509a7

[ Upstream commit de20037e1b3c2f2ca97b8c12b8c7bca8abd509a7 ]

Warning at every leaking bits can cause a flood of message, triggering
various stall-warning mechanisms to fire, including CSD locks, which
makes the machine to be unusable.

Track the bits that are being leaked, and only warn when a new bit is
set.

That said, this patch will help with the following issues:

1) It will tell us which bits are being set, so, it is easy to
   communicate it back to vendor, and to do a root-cause analyzes.

2) It avoid the machine to be unusable, because, worst case
   scenario, the user gets less than 60 WARNs (one per unhandled bit).

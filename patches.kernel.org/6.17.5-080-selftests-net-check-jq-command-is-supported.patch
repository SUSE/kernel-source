Subject: [PATCH] selftests: net: check jq command is supported
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.5
Git-commit: 4f86eb0a38bc719ba966f155071a6f0594327f34

[ Upstream commit 4f86eb0a38bc719ba966f155071a6f0594327f34 ]

The jq command is used in vlan_bridge_binding.sh, if it is not supported,
the test will spam the following log.

  # ./vlan_bridge_binding.sh: line 51: jq: command not found
  # ./vlan_bridge_binding.sh: line 51: jq: command not found
  # ./vlan_bridge_binding.sh: line 51: jq: command not found
  # ./vlan_bridge_binding.sh: line 51: jq: command not found
  # ./vlan_bridge_binding.sh: line 51: jq: command not found
  # TEST: Test bridge_binding on->off when lower down                   [FAIL]
  #       Got operstate of , expected 0

The rtnetlink.sh has the same problem. It makes sense to check if jq is
installed before running these tests. After this patch, the
vlan_bridge_binding.sh skipped if jq is not supported:

  # timeout set to 3600
  # selftests: net: vlan_bridge_binding.sh
  # TEST: jq not installed                                              [SKIP]

Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: gcc-sm8450: Do not turn off PCIe GDSCs during
 gdsc_disable()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.3
Git-commit: 889e1332310656961855c0dcedbb4dbe78e39d22

commit 889e1332310656961855c0dcedbb4dbe78e39d22 upstream.

With PWRSTS_OFF_ON, PCIe GDSCs are turned off during gdsc_disable(). This
can happen during scenarios such as system suspend and breaks the resume
of PCIe controllers from suspend.

So use PWRSTS_RET_ON to indicate the GDSC driver to not turn off the GDSCs
during gdsc_disable() and allow the hardware to transition the GDSCs to
retention when the parent domain enters low power state during system
suspend.

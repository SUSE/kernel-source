Subject: [PATCH] genirq/affinity: Consider that CPUs on nodes can be
 unbalanced
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.4
Git-commit: 08d835dff916bfe8f45acc7b92c7af6c4081c8a7

commit 08d835dff916bfe8f45acc7b92c7af6c4081c8a7 upstream.

If CPUs on a node are offline at boot time, the number of nodes is
different when building affinity masks for present cpus and when building
affinity masks for possible cpus. This causes the following problem:

In the case that the number of vectors is less than the number of nodes
there are cases where bits of masks for present cpus are overwritten when
building masks for possible cpus.

Fix this by excluding CPUs, which are not part of the current build mask
(present/possible).

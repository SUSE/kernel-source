Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: serial: rs485: Fix rs485-rts-delay property
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.64
Git-commit: 12b3642b6c242061d3ba84e6e3050c3141ded14c

commit 12b3642b6c242061d3ba84e6e3050c3141ded14c upstream.

Code expects array only with 2 items which should be checked.
But also item checking is not working as it should likely because of
incorrect items description.

Fixes: d50f974c4f7f ("dt-bindings: serial: Convert rs485 bindings to json-schema")

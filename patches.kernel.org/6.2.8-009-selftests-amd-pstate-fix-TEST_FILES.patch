Subject: [PATCH] selftests: amd-pstate: fix TEST_FILES
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.8
Git-commit: 2da789cda462bda93679f53ee38f9aa2309d47e8

[ Upstream commit 2da789cda462bda93679f53ee38f9aa2309d47e8 ]

Bring back the Python scripts that were initially added with
TEST_GEN_FILES but now with TEST_FILES to avoid having them deleted
when doing a clean.  Also fix the way the architecture is being
determined as they should also be installed when ARCH=x86_64 is
provided explicitly.  Then also append extra files to TEST_FILES and
TEST_PROGS with += so they don't get discarded.

Fixes: ba2d788aa873 ("selftests: amd-pstate: Trigger tbench benchmark and test cpus")
Fixes: a49fb7218ed8 ("selftests: amd-pstate: Don't delete source files via Makefile")

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: resource: Make Asus ExpertBook B2402 matches cover more
 models
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.4
Git-commit: 564a278573783cd8859829767851744087e676d8

commit 564a278573783cd8859829767851744087e676d8 upstream.

The Asus ExpertBook B2402CBA / B2402FBA are the non flip / flip versions
of the 14" Asus ExpertBook B2 with 12th gen Intel processors.

It has been reported that the B2402FVA which is the 14" Asus ExpertBook
B2 flip with 13th gen Intel processors needs to skip the IRQ override too.

And looking at Asus website there also is a B2402CVA which is the non flip
model with 13th gen Intel processors.

Summarizing the following 4 models of the Asus ExpertBook B2 are known:

B2402CBA: 12th gen Intel CPU, non flip
B2402FBA: 12th gen Intel CPU, flip
B2402CVA: 13th gen Intel CPU, non flip
B2402FVA: 13th gen Intel CPU, flip

Fold the 2 existing quirks for the B2402CBA and B2402FBA into a single
quirk covering B2402* to also cover the 2 other models while at the same
time reducing the number of quirks.

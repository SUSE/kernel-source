Subject: [PATCH] ext4: update s_journal_inum if it changes after journal
 replay

[ Upstream commit 3039d8b8692408438a618fac2776b629852663c3 ]

When mounting a crafted ext4 image, s_journal_inum may change after journal
replay, which is obviously unreasonable because we have successfully loaded
and replayed the journal through the old s_journal_inum. And the new
s_journal_inum bypasses some of the checks in ext4_get_journal(), which
may trigger a null pointer dereference problem. So if s_journal_inum
changes after the journal replay, we ignore the change, and rewrite the
current journal_inum to the superblock.

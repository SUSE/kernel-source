Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx7: Fix NAND controller size-cells
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: 753395ea1e45c724150070b5785900b6a44bd5fb

[ Upstream commit 753395ea1e45c724150070b5785900b6a44bd5fb ]

The NAND controller size-cells should be 0 per DT bindings.
Fix the following warning produces by DT bindings check:
"
nand-controller@33002000: #size-cells:0:0: 0 was expected
nand-controller@33002000: Unevaluated properties are not allowed ('#address-cells', '#size-cells' were unexpected)
"
Fix the missing space in node name too.

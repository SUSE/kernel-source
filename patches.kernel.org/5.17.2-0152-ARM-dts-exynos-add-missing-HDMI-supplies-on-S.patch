Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: exynos: add missing HDMI supplies on SMDK5250
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: 60a9914cb2061ba612a3f14f6ad329912b486360

commit 60a9914cb2061ba612a3f14f6ad329912b486360 upstream.

Add required VDD supplies to HDMI block on SMDK5250.  Without them, the
HDMI driver won't probe.  Because of lack of schematics, use same
supplies as on Arndale 5250 board (voltage matches).

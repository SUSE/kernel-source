Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074-hk01: enable QMP device, not the
 PHY node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.26
Git-commit: 72630ba422b70ea0874fc90d526353cf71c72488

[ Upstream commit 72630ba422b70ea0874fc90d526353cf71c72488 ]

Correct PCIe PHY enablement to refer the QMP device nodes rather than
PHY device nodes. QMP nodes have 'status = "disabled"' property in the
ipq8074.dtsi, while PHY nodes do not correspond to the actual device and
do not have the status property.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Save host DR masks on CPUs with DebugSwap
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: b2653cd3b75f62f29b72df4070e20357acb52bc4

commit b2653cd3b75f62f29b72df4070e20357acb52bc4 upstream.

When running SEV-SNP guests on a CPU that supports DebugSwap, always save
the host's DR0..DR3 mask MSR values irrespective of whether or not
DebugSwap is enabled, to ensure the host values aren't clobbered by the
CPU.  And for now, also save DR0..DR3, even though doing so isn't
necessary (see below).

SVM_VMGEXIT_AP_CREATE is deeply flawed in that it allows the *guest* to
create a VMSA with guest-controlled SEV_FEATURES.  A well behaved guest
can inform the hypervisor, i.e. KVM, of its "requested" features, but on
CPUs without ALLOWED_SEV_FEATURES support, nothing prevents the guest from
lying about which SEV features are being enabled (or not!).

If a misbehaving guest enables DebugSwap in a secondary vCPU's VMSA, the
CPU will load the DR0..DR3 mask MSRs on #VMEXIT, i.e. will clobber the
MSRs with '0' if KVM doesn't save its desired value.

Note, DR0..DR3 themselves are "ok", as DR7 is reset on #VMEXIT, and KVM
restores all DRs in common x86 code as needed via hw_breakpoint_restore().
I.e. there is no risk of host DR0..DR3 being clobbered (when it matters).
However, there is a flaw in the opposite direction; because the guest can
lie about enabling DebugSwap, i.e. can *disable* DebugSwap without KVM's
knowledge, KVM must not rely on the CPU to restore DRs.  Defer fixing
that wart, as it's more of a documentation issue than a bug in the code.

Note, KVM added support for DebugSwap on commit d1f85fbe836e ("KVM: SEV:
Enable data breakpoints in SEV-ES"), but that is not an appropriate Fixes,
as the underlying flaw exists in hardware, not in KVM.  I.e. all kernels
that support SEV-SNP need to be patched, not just kernels with KVM's full
support for DebugSwap (ignoring that DebugSwap support landed first).

Opportunistically fix an incorrect statement in the comment; on CPUs
without DebugSwap, the CPU does NOT save or load debug registers, i.e.

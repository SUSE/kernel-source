Subject: [PATCH] USB: Add USB_QUIRK_NO_LPM quirk for sony xperia xz1
 smartphone
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.4
Git-commit: 159daf1258227f44b26b5d38f4aa8f37b8cca663

commit 159daf1258227f44b26b5d38f4aa8f37b8cca663 upstream.

The fastboot tool for communicating with Android bootloaders does not
work reliably with this device if USB 2 Link Power Management (LPM)
is enabled.

Various fastboot commands are affected, including the
following, which usually reproduces the problem within two tries:

  fastboot getvar kernel
  getvar:kernel  FAILED (remote: 'GetVar Variable Not found')

This issue was hidden on many systems up until commit 63a1f8454962
("xhci: stored cached port capability values in one place") as the xhci
driver failed to detect USB 2 LPM support if USB 3 ports were listed
before USB 2 ports in the "supported protocol capabilities".

Adding the quirk resolves the issue. No drawbacks are expected since
the device uses different USB product IDs outside of fastboot mode, and
since fastboot commands worked before, until LPM was enabled on the
tested system by the aforementioned commit.

Based on a patch from Forest <forestix@nom.one> from which most of the
code and commit message is taken.

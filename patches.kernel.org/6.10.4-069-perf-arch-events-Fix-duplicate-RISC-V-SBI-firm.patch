Subject: [PATCH] perf arch events: Fix duplicate RISC-V SBI firmware event
 name
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.4
Git-commit: 63ba5b0fb4f54db256ec43b3062b2606b383055d

[ Upstream commit 63ba5b0fb4f54db256ec43b3062b2606b383055d ]

Currently, the RISC-V firmware JSON file has duplicate event name
"FW_SFENCE_VMA_RECEIVED". According to the RISC-V SBI PMU extension[1],
the event name should be "FW_SFENCE_VMA_ASID_SENT".

Before this patch:
$ perf list

firmware:
  fw_access_load
       [Load access trap event. Unit: cpu]
  fw_access_store
       [Store access trap event. Unit: cpu]
....
 fw_set_timer
       [Set timer event. Unit: cpu]
  fw_sfence_vma_asid_received
       [Received SFENCE.VMA with ASID request from other HART event. Unit: cpu]
  fw_sfence_vma_received
       [Sent SFENCE.VMA with ASID request to other HART event. Unit: cpu]

After this patch:
$ perf list

firmware:
  fw_access_load
       [Load access trap event. Unit: cpu]
  fw_access_store
       [Store access trap event. Unit: cpu]
.....
  fw_set_timer
       [Set timer event. Unit: cpu]
  fw_sfence_vma_asid_received
       [Received SFENCE.VMA with ASID request from other HART event. Unit: cpu]
  fw_sfence_vma_asid_sent
       [Sent SFENCE.VMA with ASID request to other HART event. Unit: cpu]
  fw_sfence_vma_received
       [Received SFENCE.VMA request from other HART event. Unit: cpu]

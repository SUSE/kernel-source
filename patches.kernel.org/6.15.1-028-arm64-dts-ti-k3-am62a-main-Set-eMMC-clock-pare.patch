Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62a-main: Set eMMC clock parent to
 default
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.1
Git-commit: 6af731c5de59cc4e7cce193d446f1fe872ac711b

commit 6af731c5de59cc4e7cce193d446f1fe872ac711b upstream.

Set eMMC clock parents to the defaults which is MAIN_PLL0_HSDIV5_CLKOUT
for eMMC. This change is necessary since DM is not implementing the
correct procedure to switch PLL clock source for eMMC and MMC CLK mux is
not glich-free. As a preventative action, lets switch back to the defaults.

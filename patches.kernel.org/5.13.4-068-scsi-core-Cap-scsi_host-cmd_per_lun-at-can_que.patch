Subject: [PATCH] scsi: core: Cap scsi_host cmd_per_lun at can_queue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: ea2f0f77538c50739b9fb4de4700cee5535e1f77

[ Upstream commit ea2f0f77538c50739b9fb4de4700cee5535e1f77 ]

The sysfs handling function sdev_store_queue_depth() enforces that the sdev
queue depth cannot exceed shost can_queue. The initial sdev queue depth
comes from shost cmd_per_lun. However, the LLDD may manually set
cmd_per_lun to be larger than can_queue, which leads to an initial sdev
queue depth greater than can_queue.

Such an issue was reported in [0], which caused a hang. That has since been
fixed in commit fc09acb7de31 ("scsi: scsi_debug: Fix cmd_per_lun, set to
max_queue").

Stop this possibly happening for other drivers by capping shost cmd_per_lun
at shost can_queue.

Subject: [PATCH] bcache: remove redundant assignment to variable cur_idx
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.69
Git-commit: be93825f0e6428c2d3f03a6e4d447dc48d33d7ff

[ Upstream commit be93825f0e6428c2d3f03a6e4d447dc48d33d7ff ]

Variable cur_idx is being initialized with a value that is never read,
it is being re-assigned later in a while-loop. Remove the redundant
assignment. Cleans up clang scan build warning:

drivers/md/bcache/writeback.c:916:2: warning: Value stored to 'cur_idx'
is never read [deadcode.DeadStores]

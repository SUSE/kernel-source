Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Remove undocumented sdmmc property from
 lubancat-1
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.21
Git-commit: 43c854c65e47d2f3763345683b06257b4d12e4e3

[ Upstream commit 43c854c65e47d2f3763345683b06257b4d12e4e3 ]

Property "supports-sd" isn't documented anywhere and is unnecessary for
mainline driver to function. It seems a property used by downstream
kernel was brought into mainline.

This should be reported by dtbs_check, but mmc-controller-common.yaml
defaults additionalProperties to true thus allows it. Remove the
property to clean the devicetree up and avoid possible confusion.

Subject: [PATCH] media: ov5648: Don't pack controls struct
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: edd4fbff5378a8103470304809195dc8f4b1d42a

[ Upstream commit edd4fbff5378a8103470304809195dc8f4b1d42a ]

Don't pack the driver specific struct containing control pointers. This
lead to potential alignment issues when working with the pointers.

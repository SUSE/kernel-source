Subject: [PATCH] iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Set TTL invalidation hint better
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.57
Git-commit: 6833b8f2e19945a41e4d5efd8c6d9f4cae9a5b7d

[ Upstream commit 6833b8f2e19945a41e4d5efd8c6d9f4cae9a5b7d ]

When io-pgtable unmaps a whole table, rather than waste time walking it
to find the leaf entries to invalidate exactly, it simply expects
.tlb_flush_walk with nominal last-level granularity to invalidate any
leaf entries at higher intermediate levels as well. This works fine with
page-based invalidation, but with range commands we need to be careful
with the TTL hint - unconditionally setting it based on the given level
3 granule means that an invalidation for a level 1 table would strictly
not be required to affect level 2 block entries. It's easy to comply
with the expected behaviour by simply not setting the TTL hint for
non-leaf invalidations, so let's do that.

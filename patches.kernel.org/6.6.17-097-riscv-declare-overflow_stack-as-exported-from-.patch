Subject: [PATCH] riscv: declare overflow_stack as exported from traps.c
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.17
Git-commit: 2cf963787529f615f7c93bdcf13a5e82029e7f38

[ Upstream commit 2cf963787529f615f7c93bdcf13a5e82029e7f38 ]

The percpu area overflow_stacks is exported from arch/riscv/kernel/traps.c
for use in the entry code, but is not declared anywhere. Add the relevant
declaration to arch/riscv/include/asm/stacktrace.h to silence the following
sparse warning:

arch/riscv/kernel/traps.c:395:1: warning: symbol '__pcpu_scope_overflow_stack' was not declared. Should it be static?

We don't add the stackinfo_get_overflow() call as for some of the other
architectures as this doesn't seem to be used yet, so just silence the
warning.

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sdhci_am654: Write ITAPDLY for DDR52 timing
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.33
Git-commit: d465234493bb6ad1b9c10a0c9ef9881b8d85081a

[ Upstream commit d465234493bb6ad1b9c10a0c9ef9881b8d85081a ]

For DDR52 timing, DLL is enabled but tuning is not carried
out, therefore the ITAPDLY value in PHY CTRL 4 register is
not correct. Fix this by writing ITAPDLY after enabling DLL.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/rockchip: vop2: make vp registers nonvolatile
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.6
Git-commit: a52dffaa46c2c5ff0b311c4dc1288581f7b9109e

[ Upstream commit a52dffaa46c2c5ff0b311c4dc1288581f7b9109e ]

Make video port registers nonvolatile. As DSP_CTRL register is written
to twice due to gamma LUT enable bit which is set outside of the main
DSP_CTRL initialization within atomic_enable (for rk356x case it is also
necessary to always disable gamma LUT before writing a new LUT) there is
a chance that DSP_CTRL value read-out in gamma LUT init/update code is
not the one which was written by the preceding DSP_CTRL initialization
code within atomic_enable. This might result in misconfigured DSP_CTRL
which leads to no visual output[1]. Since DSP_CTRL write takes effect
after VSYNC[1] the issue is not always present. When tested on Pinetab2
with kernel 6.14 it happenes only when DRM is compiled as a module[1].
In order to confirm that it is a timing issue I inserted 18ms udelay
before vop2_crtc_atomic_try_set_gamma in atomic enable and compiled DRM
as module - this has also fixed the issue.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests/mm: build with -O2
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.17
Git-commit: 46036188ea1f5266df23a6149dea0df1c77cd1c7

commit 46036188ea1f5266df23a6149dea0df1c77cd1c7 upstream.

The mm kselftests are currently built with no optimisation (-O0).  It's
unclear why, and besides being obviously suboptimal, this also prevents
the pkeys tests from working as intended.  Let's build all the tests with
-O2.

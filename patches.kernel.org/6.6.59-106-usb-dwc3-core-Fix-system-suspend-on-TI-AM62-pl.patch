Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: core: Fix system suspend on TI AM62 platforms
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.59
Git-commit: 705e3ce37bccdf2ed6f848356ff355f480d51a91

[ Upstream commit 705e3ce37bccdf2ed6f848356ff355f480d51a91 ]

Since commit 6d735722063a ("usb: dwc3: core: Prevent phy suspend during init"),
system suspend is broken on AM62 TI platforms.

Before that commit, both DWC3_GUSB3PIPECTL_SUSPHY and DWC3_GUSB2PHYCFG_SUSPHY
bits (hence forth called 2 SUSPHY bits) were being set during core
initialization and even during core re-initialization after a system
suspend/resume.

These bits are required to be set for system suspend/resume to work correctly
on AM62 platforms.

Since that commit, the 2 SUSPHY bits are not set for DEVICE/OTG mode if gadget
driver is not loaded and started.
For Host mode, the 2 SUSPHY bits are set before the first system suspend but
get cleared at system resume during core re-init and are never set again.

This patch resovles these two issues by ensuring the 2 SUSPHY bits are set
before system suspend and restored to the original state during system resume.

Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: Reject connection with the device which has same
 BD_ADDR
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.9
Git-commit: 1ffc6f8cc33268731fcf9629fc4438f6db1191fc

commit 1ffc6f8cc33268731fcf9629fc4438f6db1191fc upstream.

This change is used to relieve CVE-2020-26555. The description of
the CVE:

Bluetooth legacy BR/EDR PIN code pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification
1.0B through 5.2 may permit an unauthenticated nearby device to spoof
the BD_ADDR of the peer device to complete pairing without knowledge
of the PIN. [1]

The detail of this attack is in IEEE paper:
BlueMirror: Reflections on Bluetooth Pairing and Provisioning Protocols
[2]

It's a reflection attack. The paper mentioned that attacker can induce
the attacked target to generate null link key (zero key) without PIN
code. In BR/EDR, the key generation is actually handled in the controller
which is below HCI.

A condition of this attack is that attacker should change the
BR_ADDR of his hacking device (Host B) to equal to the BR_ADDR with
the target device being attacked (Host A).

Thus, we reject the connection with device which has same BD_ADDR
both on HCI_Create_Connection and HCI_Connection_Request to prevent
the attack. A similar implementation also shows in btstack project.

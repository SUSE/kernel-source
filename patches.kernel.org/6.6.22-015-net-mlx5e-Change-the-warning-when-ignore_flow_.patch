Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5e: Change the warning when ignore_flow_level is not
 supported
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.22
Git-commit: dd238b702064b21d25b4fc39a19699319746d655

[ Upstream commit dd238b702064b21d25b4fc39a19699319746d655 ]

Downgrade the print from mlx5_core_warn() to mlx5_core_dbg(), as it
is just a statement of fact that firmware doesn't support ignore flow
level.

And change the wording to "firmware flow level support is missing", to
make it more accurate.

Fixes: ae2ee3be99a8 ("net/mlx5: CT: Remove warning of ignore_flow_level support for VFs")

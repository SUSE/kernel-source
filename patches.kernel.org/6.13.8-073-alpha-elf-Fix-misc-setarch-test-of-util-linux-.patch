In [2] it was pointed out that parts of setarch weren't working
properly on alpha because it has it's own SET_PERSONALITY
implementation.  In the discussion that followed Richard Henderson
pointed out that the 32bit pointer support for alpha was never
completed.

Fix this by removing alpha's 32bit pointer support.

As a bit of paranoia refuse to execute any alpha binaries that have
the EF_ALPHA_32BIT flag set.  Just in case someone somewhere has
binaries that try to use alpha's 32bit pointer support.

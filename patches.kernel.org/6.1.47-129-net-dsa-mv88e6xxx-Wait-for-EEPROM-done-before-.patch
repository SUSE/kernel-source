Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Wait for EEPROM done before HW reset
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.47
Git-commit: 23d775f12dcd23d052a4927195f15e970e27ab26

[ Upstream commit 23d775f12dcd23d052a4927195f15e970e27ab26 ]

If the switch is reset during active EEPROM transactions, as in
just after an SoC reset after power up, the I2C bus transaction
may be cut short leaving the EEPROM internal I2C state machine
in the wrong state.  When the switch is reset again, the bad
state machine state may result in data being read from the wrong
memory location causing the switch to enter unexpected mode
rendering it inoperational.

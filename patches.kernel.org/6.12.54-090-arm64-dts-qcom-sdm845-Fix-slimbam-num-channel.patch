Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Fix slimbam num-channels/ees
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.54
Git-commit: 316294bb6695a43a9181973ecd4e6fb3e576a9f7

commit 316294bb6695a43a9181973ecd4e6fb3e576a9f7 upstream.

Reading the hardware registers of the &slimbam on RB3 reveals that the BAM
supports only 23 pipes (channels) and supports 4 EEs instead of 2. This
hasn't caused problems so far since nothing is using the extra channels,
but attempting to use them would lead to crashes.

The bam_dma driver might warn in the future if the num-channels in the DT
are wrong, so correct the properties in the DT to avoid future regressions.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/amdkfd: Fix kernel panic when reset failed and been
 triggered again
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.7
Git-commit: 2cf49e00d40d5132e3d067b5aa6d84791929ab15

[ Upstream commit 2cf49e00d40d5132e3d067b5aa6d84791929ab15 ]

In SRIOV configuration, the reset may failed to bring asic back to normal but stop cpsch
already been called, the start_cpsch will not be called since there is no resume in this
case.  When reset been triggered again, driver should avoid to do uninitialization again.

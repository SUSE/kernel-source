Subject: [PATCH] net/9p: fix bug in client create for .L
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.21
Git-commit: 3866584a1c56a2bbc8c0981deb4476d0b801969e

[ Upstream commit 3866584a1c56a2bbc8c0981deb4476d0b801969e ]

We are supposed to set fid->mode to reflect the flags
that were used to open the file.  We were actually setting
it to the creation mode which is the default perms of the
file not the flags the file was opened with.

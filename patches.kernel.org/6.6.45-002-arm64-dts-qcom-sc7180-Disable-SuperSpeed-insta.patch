Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Disable SuperSpeed instances in
 park mode
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.45
Git-commit: 5b8baed4b88132c12010ce6ca1b56f00d122e376

[ Upstream commit 5b8baed4b88132c12010ce6ca1b56f00d122e376 ]

On SC7180, in host mode, it is observed that stressing out controller
results in HC died error:

 xhci-hcd.12.auto: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
 xhci-hcd.12.auto: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
 xhci-hcd.12.auto: HC died; cleaning up

And at this instant only restarting the host mode fixes it. Disable
SuperSpeed instances in park mode for SC7180 to mitigate this issue.

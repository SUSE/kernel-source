Subject: [PATCH] selftests: forwarding: Avoid failures to source net/lib.sh
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.35
Git-commit: 2114e83381d3289a88378850f43069e79f848083

commit 2114e83381d3289a88378850f43069e79f848083 upstream.

The expression "source ../lib.sh" added to net/forwarding/lib.sh in commit
25ae948b4478 ("selftests/net: add lib.sh") does not work for tests outside
net/forwarding which source net/forwarding/lib.sh (1). It also does not
work in some cases where only a subset of tests are exported (2).

Avoid the problems mentioned above by replacing the faulty expression with
a copy of the content from net/lib.sh which is used by files under
net/forwarding.

A more thorough solution which avoids duplicating content between
net/lib.sh and net/forwarding/lib.sh has been posted here:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20231222135836.992841-1-bpoirier@nvidia.com/

The approach in the current patch is a stopgap solution to avoid submitting
large changes at the eleventh hour of this development cycle.

Example of problem 1)

tools/testing/selftests/drivers/net/bonding$ ./dev_addr_lists.sh
./net_forwarding_lib.sh: line 41: ../lib.sh: No such file or directory
TEST: bonding cleanup mode active-backup                            [ OK ]
TEST: bonding cleanup mode 802.3ad                                  [ OK ]
TEST: bonding LACPDU multicast address to slave (from bond down)    [ OK ]
TEST: bonding LACPDU multicast address to slave (from bond up)      [ OK ]

An error message is printed but since the test does not use functions from
net/lib.sh, the test results are not affected.

Example of problem 2)

tools/testing/selftests$ make install TARGETS="net/forwarding"
tools/testing/selftests$ cd kselftest_install/net/forwarding/
tools/testing/selftests/kselftest_install/net/forwarding$ ./pedit_ip.sh veth{0..3}
lib.sh: line 41: ../lib.sh: No such file or directory
TEST: ping                                                          [ OK ]
TEST: ping6                                                         [ OK ]
./pedit_ip.sh: line 135: busywait: command not found
TEST: dev veth1 ingress pedit ip src set 198.51.100.1               [FAIL]
        Expected to get 10 packets, but got .
./pedit_ip.sh: line 135: busywait: command not found
TEST: dev veth2 egress pedit ip src set 198.51.100.1                [FAIL]
        Expected to get 10 packets, but got .
./pedit_ip.sh: line 135: busywait: command not found
TEST: dev veth1 ingress pedit ip dst set 198.51.100.1               [FAIL]
        Expected to get 10 packets, but got .
./pedit_ip.sh: line 135: busywait: command not found

        Expected to get 10 packets, but got .
./pedit_ip.sh: line 135: busywait: command not found
TEST: dev veth1 ingress pedit ip6 src set 2001:db8:2::1             [FAIL]
        Expected to get 10 packets, but got .
./pedit_ip.sh: line 135: busywait: command not found
TEST: dev veth2 egress pedit ip6 src set 2001:db8:2::1              [FAIL]
        Expected to get 10 packets, but got .
./pedit_ip.sh: line 135: busywait: command not found
TEST: dev veth1 ingress pedit ip6 dst set 2001:db8:2::1             [FAIL]
        Expected to get 10 packets, but got .
./pedit_ip.sh: line 135: busywait: command not found
TEST: dev veth2 egress pedit ip6 dst set 2001:db8:2::1              [FAIL]
        Expected to get 10 packets, but got .

In this case, the test results are affected.

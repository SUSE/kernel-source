Subject: [PATCH] ptp: vmclock: Don't unregister misc device if it was not
 registered
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628

Git-commit: 39e926c3a21b25af6cae479fbb752f193240ce03

commit 39e926c3a21b25af6cae479fbb752f193240ce03 upstream.

vmclock_remove() tries to detect the successful registration of the misc
device based on the value of its minor value.
However that check is incorrect if the misc device registration was not
attempted in the first place.

Always initialize the minor number, so the check works properly.

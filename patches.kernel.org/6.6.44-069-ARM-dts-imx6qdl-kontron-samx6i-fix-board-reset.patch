Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6qdl-kontron-samx6i: fix board reset
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.44
Git-commit: b972d6b3b46345023aee56a95df8e2c137aa4ee4

[ Upstream commit b972d6b3b46345023aee56a95df8e2c137aa4ee4 ]

On i.MX6 the board is reset by the watchdog. But in turn to do a
complete board reset, we have to assert the WDOG_B output which is
routed also to the CPLD which then do a complete power-cycle of the
board.

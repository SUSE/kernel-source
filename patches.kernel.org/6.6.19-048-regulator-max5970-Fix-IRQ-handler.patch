Subject: [PATCH] regulator (max5970): Fix IRQ handler
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: a3fa9838e8140584a6f338e8516f2b05d3bea812

[ Upstream commit a3fa9838e8140584a6f338e8516f2b05d3bea812 ]

The max5970 datasheet gives the impression that IRQ status bits must
be cleared by writing a one to set bits, as those are marked with 'R/C',
however tests showed that a zero must be written.

Fixes an IRQ storm as the interrupt handler actually clears the IRQ
status bits.

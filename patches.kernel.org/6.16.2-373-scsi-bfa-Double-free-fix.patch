Subject: [PATCH] scsi: bfa: Double-free fix
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: add4c4850363d7c1b72e8fce9ccb21fdd2cf5dc9

[ Upstream commit add4c4850363d7c1b72e8fce9ccb21fdd2cf5dc9 ]

When the bfad_im_probe() function fails during initialization, the memory
pointed to by bfad->im is freed without setting bfad->im to NULL.

Subsequently, during driver uninstallation, when the state machine enters
the bfad_sm_stopping state and calls the bfad_im_probe_undo() function,
it attempts to free the memory pointed to by bfad->im again, thereby
triggering a double-free vulnerability.

Set bfad->im to NULL if probing fails.

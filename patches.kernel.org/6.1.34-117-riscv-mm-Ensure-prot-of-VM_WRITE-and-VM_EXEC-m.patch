Subject: [PATCH] riscv: mm: Ensure prot of VM_WRITE and VM_EXEC must be
 readable
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.34
Git-commit: 6569fc12e442ea973d96db39e542aa19a7bc3a79

[ Upstream commit 6569fc12e442ea973d96db39e542aa19a7bc3a79 ]

Commit 8aeb7b17f04e ("RISC-V: Make mmap() with PROT_WRITE imply PROT_READ")
allows riscv to use mmap with PROT_WRITE only, and meanwhile mmap with w+x
is also permitted. However, when userspace tries to access this page with
PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, which causes infinite loop at load page fault as
well as it triggers soft lockup. According to riscv privileged spec,
"Writable pages must also be marked readable". The fix to drop the
`PAGE_COPY_READ_EXEC` and then `PAGE_COPY_EXEC` would be just used instead.
This aligns the other arches (i.e arm64) for protection_map.

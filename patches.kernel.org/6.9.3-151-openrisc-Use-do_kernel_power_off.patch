Subject: [PATCH] openrisc: Use do_kernel_power_off()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: c94195a34e09dacfe2feef03602c911e82f49994

[ Upstream commit c94195a34e09dacfe2feef03602c911e82f49994 ]

After commit 14c5678720bd ("power: reset: syscon-poweroff: Use
devm_register_sys_off_handler(POWER_OFF)") setting up of pm_power_off
was removed from the driver, this causes OpenRISC platforms using
syscon-poweroff to no longer shutdown.

The kernel now supports chained power-off handlers. Use
do_kernel_power_off() that invokes chained power-off handlers.  All
architectures have moved away from using pm_power_off except OpenRISC.

This patch migrates openrisc to use do_kernel_power_off() instead of the
legacy pm_power_off().

Fixes: 14c5678720bd ("power: reset: syscon-poweroff: Use devm_register_sys_off_handler(POWER_OFF)")

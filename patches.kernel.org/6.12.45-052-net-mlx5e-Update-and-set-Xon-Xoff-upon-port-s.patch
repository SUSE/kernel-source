Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5e: Update and set Xon/Xoff upon port speed set
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.45
Git-commit: d24341740fe48add8a227a753e68b6eedf4b385a

[ Upstream commit d24341740fe48add8a227a753e68b6eedf4b385a ]

Xon/Xoff sizes are derived from calculations that include
the port speed.
These settings need to be updated and applied whenever the
port speed is changed.
The port speed is typically set after the physical link goes down
and is negotiated as part of the link-up process between the two
connected interfaces.
Xon/Xoff parameters being updated at the point where the new
negotiated speed is established.

autofs_wait_queue structs should be freed if their wait_ctr becomes zero.
Otherwise they will be lost.

In this case an AUTOFS_IOC_EXPIRE_MULTI ioctl is done, then a new
waitqueue struct is allocated in autofs_wait(), its initial wait_ctr
equals 2. After that wait_event_killable() is interrupted (it returns
-ERESTARTSYS), so that 'wq->name.name == NULL' condition may be not
satisfied. Actually, this condition can be satisfied when
autofs_wait_release() or autofs_catatonic_mode() is called and, what is
also important, wait_ctr is decremented in those places. Upon the exit of
autofs_wait(), wait_ctr is decremented to 1. Then the unmounting process
begins: kill_sb calls autofs_catatonic_mode(), which should have freed the
waitqueues, but it only decrements its usage counter to zero which is not
a correct behaviour.

edit:imk
This description is of course not correct. The umount performed as a result
of an expire is a umount of a mount that has been automounted, it's not the
autofs mount itself. They happen independently, usually after everything
mounted within the autofs file system has been expired away. If everything
hasn't been expired away the automount daemon can still exit leaving mounts
in place. But expires done in both cases will result in a notification that
calls autofs_wait_release() with a result status. The problem case is the
summary execution of of the automount daemon. In this case any waiting
processes won't be woken up until either they are terminated or the mount
is umounted.
end edit: imk

So in catatonic mode we should free waitqueues which counter becomes zero.

edit: imk
Initially I was concerned that the calling of autofs_wait_release() and
autofs_catatonic_mode() was not mutually exclusive but that can't be the
case (obviously) because the queue entry (or entries) is removed from the
list when either of these two functions are called. Consequently the wait
entry will be freed by only one of these functions or by the woken process
in autofs_wait() depending on the order of the calls.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: freescale: imx8mm-verdin: Keep LDO5 always on
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.40
Git-commit: fbe94be09fa81343d623a86ec64a742759b669b3

commit fbe94be09fa81343d623a86ec64a742759b669b3 upstream.

LDO5 regulator is used to power the i.MX8MM NVCC_SD2 I/O supply, that is
used for the SD2 card interface and also for some GPIOs.

When the SD card interface is not enabled the regulator subsystem could
turn off this supply, since it is not used anywhere else, however this
will also remove the power to some other GPIOs, for example one I/O that
is used to power the ethernet phy, leading to a non working ethernet
interface.

[   31.820515] On-module +V3.3_1.8_SD (LDO5): disabling
[   31.821761] PMIC_USDHC_VSELECT: disabling
[   32.764949] fec 30be0000.ethernet end0: Link is Down

Fix this keeping the LDO5 supply always on.

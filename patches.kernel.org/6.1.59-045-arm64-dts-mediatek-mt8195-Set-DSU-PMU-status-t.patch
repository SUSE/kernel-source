Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8195: Set DSU PMU status to fail

[ Upstream commit d192615c307ec9f74cd0582880ece698533eb99b ]

The DSU PMU allows monitoring performance events in the DSU cluster,
which is done by configuring and reading back values from the DSU PMU
system registers. However, for write-access to be allowed by ELs lower
than EL3, the EL3 firmware needs to update the setting on the ACTLR3_EL3
register, as it is disallowed by default.

That configuration is not done on the firmware used by the MT8195 SoC,
as a consequence, booting a MT8195-based machine like
mt8195-cherry-tomato-r2 with CONFIG_ARM_DSU_PMU enabled hangs the kernel
just as it writes to the CLUSTERPMOVSCLR_EL1 register, since the
instruction faults to EL3, and BL31 apparently just re-runs the
instruction over and over.

Mark the DSU PMU node in the Devicetree with status "fail", as the
machine doesn't have a suitable firmware to make use of it from the
kernel, and allowing its driver to probe would hang the kernel.

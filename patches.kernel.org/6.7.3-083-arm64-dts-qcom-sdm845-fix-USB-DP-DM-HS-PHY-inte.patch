Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: fix USB DP/DM HS PHY interrupts
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.3
Git-commit: 204f9ed4bad6293933179517624143b8f412347c

commit 204f9ed4bad6293933179517624143b8f412347c upstream.

The USB DP/DM HS PHY interrupts need to be provided by the PDC interrupt
controller in order to be able to wake the system up from low-power
states and to be able to detect disconnect events, which requires
triggering on falling edges.

A recent commit updated the trigger type but failed to change the
interrupt provider as required. This leads to the current Linux driver
failing to probe instead of printing an error during suspend and USB
wakeup not working as intended.

Fixes: 84ad9ac8d9ca ("arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: fix USB wakeup interrupt types")
Fixes: ca4db2b538a1 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Add USB-related nodes")

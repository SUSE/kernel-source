Subject: [PATCH] interconnect: qcom: rpm: Don't use clk_get_optional for bus
 clocks anymore
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.4
Git-commit: 1ff7aedcdcdd4fe02201269ab428b09491e5cf6e

[ Upstream commit 1ff7aedcdcdd4fe02201269ab428b09491e5cf6e ]

Commit dd42ec8ea5b9 ("interconnect: qcom: rpm: Use _optional func for provider clocks")
relaxed the requirements around probing bus clocks. This was a decent
solution for making sure MSM8996 would still boot with old DTs, but
now that there's a proper fix in place that both old and new DTs
will be happy about, revert back to the safer variant of the
function.

Subject: [PATCH] fbdev: stifb: Make the STI next font pointer a 32-bit signed
 offset
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.3
Git-commit: 8a32aa17c1cd48df1ddaa78e45abcb8c7a2220d6

commit 8a32aa17c1cd48df1ddaa78e45abcb8c7a2220d6 upstream.

The pointer to the next STI font is actually a signed 32-bit
offset. With this change the 64-bit kernel will correctly subract
the (signed 32-bit) offset instead of adding a (unsigned 32-bit)
offset. It has no effect on 32-bit kernels.

This fixes the stifb driver with a 64-bit kernel on qemu.

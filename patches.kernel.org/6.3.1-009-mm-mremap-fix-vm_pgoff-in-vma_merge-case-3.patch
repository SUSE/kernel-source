Subject: [PATCH] mm/mremap: fix vm_pgoff in vma_merge() case 3
Patch-mainline: 6.3.1
References: bsc#1012628 bsc#1210903
Git-commit: 7e7757876f258d99266e7b3c559639289a2a45fe

commit 7e7757876f258d99266e7b3c559639289a2a45fe upstream.

After upgrading build guests to v6.3, rpm started segfaulting for
specific packages, which was bisected to commit 0503ea8f5ba7 ("mm/mmap:
remove __vma_adjust()"). rpm is doing many mremap() operations with file
mappings of its db. The problem is that in vma_merge() case 3 (we merge
with the next vma, expanding it downwards) vm_pgoff is not adjusted as
it should when vm_start changes. As a result the rpm process most likely
sees data from the wrong offset of the file. Fix the vm_pgoff
calculation.

For case 8 this is a non-functional change as the resulting vm_pgoff is
the same.

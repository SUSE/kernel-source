Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: fsl-edma: avoid linking both modules
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.7
Git-commit: fa555b5026d0bf1ba7c9e645ff75e2725a982631

[ Upstream commit fa555b5026d0bf1ba7c9e645ff75e2725a982631 ]

Kbuild does not support having a source file compiled multiple times
and linked into distinct modules, or built-in and modular at the
same time. For fs-edma, there are two common components that are
linked into the fsl-edma.ko for Arm and PowerPC, plus the mcf-edma.ko
module on Coldfire. This violates the rule for compile-testing:

scripts/Makefile.build:236: drivers/dma/Makefile: fsl-edma-common.o is added to multiple modules: fsl-edma mcf-edma
scripts/Makefile.build:236: drivers/dma/Makefile: fsl-edma-trace.o is added to multiple modules: fsl-edma mcf-edma

I tried splitting out the common parts into a separate modules, but
that adds back the complexity that a cleanup patch removed, and it
gets harder with the addition of the tracepoints.

As a minimal workaround, address it at the Kconfig level, by disallowing
the broken configurations.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Explicitly zero EAX and EBX when PERFMON_V2 isn't
 supported by KVM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.7
Git-commit: f9dc8fb3afc968042bdaf4b6e445a9272071c9f3

commit f9dc8fb3afc968042bdaf4b6e445a9272071c9f3 upstream.

Fix a goof where KVM sets CPUID.0x80000022.EAX to CPUID.0x80000022.EBX
instead of zeroing both when PERFMON_V2 isn't supported by KVM.  In
practice, barring a buggy CPU (or vCPU model when running nested) only the
!enable_pmu case is affected, as KVM always supports PERFMON_V2 if it's
available in hardware, i.e. CPUID.0x80000022.EBX will be '0' if PERFMON_V2
is unsupported.

For the !enable_pmu case, the bug is relatively benign as KVM will refuse
to enable PMU capabilities, but a VMM that reflects KVM's supported CPUID
into the guest could inadvertently induce #GPs in the guest due to
advertising support for MSRs that KVM refuses to emulate.

Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: Skip erase logic when SPI_NOR_NO_ERASE is set
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: 151c6b49d679872d6fc0b50e0ad96303091694a2

commit 151c6b49d679872d6fc0b50e0ad96303091694a2 upstream.

Even if SPI_NOR_NO_ERASE was set, one could still send erase opcodes
to the flash. It is not recommended to send unsupported opcodes to
flashes. Fix the logic and do not set mtd->_erase when SPI_NOR_NO_ERASE
is specified. With this users will not be able to issue erase opcodes to
flashes and instead they will recive an -ENOTSUPP error.

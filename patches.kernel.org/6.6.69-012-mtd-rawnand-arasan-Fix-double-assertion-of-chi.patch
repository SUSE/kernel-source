Subject: [PATCH] mtd: rawnand: arasan: Fix double assertion of chip-select
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.69
Git-commit: b086a46dae48829e11c0c02580e30d920b76743c

commit b086a46dae48829e11c0c02580e30d920b76743c upstream.

When two chip-selects are configured in the device tree, and the second is
a non-native GPIO, both the GPIO-based chip-select and the first native
chip-select may be asserted simultaneously. This double assertion causes
incorrect read and write operations.

The issue occurs because when nfc->ncs <= 2, nfc->spare_cs is always
initialized to 0 due to static initialization. Consequently, when the
second chip-select (GPIO-based) is selected in anfc_assert_cs(), it is
detected by anfc_is_gpio_cs(), and nfc->native_cs is assigned the value 0.
This results in both the GPIO-based chip-select being asserted and the
NAND controller register receiving 0, erroneously selecting the native
chip-select.

This patch resolves the issue, as confirmed by oscilloscope testing with
configurations involving two or more chip-selects in the device tree.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: Fix MPSS memory length
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: fa6442e87ab7c4a58c0b5fc64aab1aacc8034712

commit fa6442e87ab7c4a58c0b5fc64aab1aacc8034712 upstream.

The address space in MPSS/Modem PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)
remoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space
(QDSP6...SS_PUB) which has a length of 0x10000.  Value of 0x4040 was
copied from older DTS, but it grew since then.

This should have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader
does not use this address space at all.

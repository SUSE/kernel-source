Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: processor_idle: use raw_safe_halt() in
 acpi_idle_play_dead()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.4
Git-commit: 9bb69ba4c177dccaa1f5b5cbdf80b67813328348

commit 9bb69ba4c177dccaa1f5b5cbdf80b67813328348 upstream.

Xen HVM guests were observed taking triple-faults when attempting to
online a previously offlined vCPU.

Investigation showed that the fault was coming from a failing call
to lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled(), in load_current_idt() which was
too early in the CPU bringup to actually catch the exception and
report the failure cleanly.

This was a false positive, caused by acpi_idle_play_dead() setting
the per-cpu hardirqs_enabled flag by calling safe_halt(). Switch it
to use raw_safe_halt() instead, which doesn't do so.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6qdl-gw59{10,13}: fix user pushbutton GPIO
 offset
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.8
Git-commit: bb5ad73941dc3f4e3c2241348f385da6501d50ea

[ Upstream commit bb5ad73941dc3f4e3c2241348f385da6501d50ea ]

The GW5910 and GW5913 have a user pushbutton that is tied to the
Gateworks System Controller GPIO offset 2. Fix the invalid offset of 0.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: PCM: Allow resume only for suspended streams
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.42
Git-commit: 1225675ca74c746f09211528588e83b3def1ff6a

[ Upstream commit 1225675ca74c746f09211528588e83b3def1ff6a ]

snd_pcm_resume() should bail out if the stream isn't in a suspended
state.  Otherwise it'd allow doubly resume.

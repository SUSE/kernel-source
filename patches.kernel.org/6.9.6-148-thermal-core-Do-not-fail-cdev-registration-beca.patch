Subject: [PATCH] thermal: core: Do not fail cdev registration because of
 invalid initial state
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.6
Git-commit: 1af89dedc8a58006d8e385b1e0d2cd24df8a3b69

[ Upstream commit 1af89dedc8a58006d8e385b1e0d2cd24df8a3b69 ]

It is reported that commit 31a0fa0019b0 ("thermal/debugfs: Pass cooling
device state to thermal_debug_cdev_add()") causes the ACPI fan driver
to fail probing on some systems which turns out to be due to the _FST
control method returning an invalid value until _FSL is first evaluated
for the given fan.  If this happens, the .get_cur_state() cooling device
callback returns an error and __thermal_cooling_device_register() fails
as uses that callback after commit 31a0fa0019b0.

Arguably, _FST should not return an invalid value even if it is
evaluated before _FSL, so this may be regarded as a platform firmware
issue, but at the same time it is not a good enough reason for failing
the cooling device registration where the initial cooling device state
is only needed to initialize a thermal debug facility.

Accordingly, modify __thermal_cooling_device_register() to avoid
calling thermal_debug_cdev_add() instead of returning an error if the
initial .get_cur_state() callback invocation fails.

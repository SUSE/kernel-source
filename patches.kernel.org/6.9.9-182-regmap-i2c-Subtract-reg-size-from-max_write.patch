Subject: [PATCH] regmap-i2c: Subtract reg size from max_write
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.9
Git-commit: 611b7eb19d0a305d4de00280e4a71a1b15c507fc

[ Upstream commit 611b7eb19d0a305d4de00280e4a71a1b15c507fc ]

Currently, when an adapter defines a max_write_len quirk,
the data will be chunked into data sizes equal to the
max_write_len quirk value.  But the payload will be increased by
the size of the register address before transmission.  The
resulting value always ends up larger than the limit set
by the quirk.

Avoid this error by setting regmap's max_write to the quirk's
max_write_len minus the number of bytes for the register and
padding.  This allows the chunking to work correctly for this
limited case without impacting other use-cases.

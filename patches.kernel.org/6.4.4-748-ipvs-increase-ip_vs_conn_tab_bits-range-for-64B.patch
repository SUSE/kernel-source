Subject: [PATCH] ipvs: increase ip_vs_conn_tab_bits range for 64BIT
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.4
Git-commit: 04292c695f82b6cf0d25dd5ae494f16ddbb621f6

commit 04292c695f82b6cf0d25dd5ae494f16ddbb621f6 upstream.

Current range [8, 20] is set purely due to historical reasons
because at the time, ~1M (2^20) was considered sufficient.
With this change, 27 is the upper limit for 64-bit, 20 otherwise.

Previous change regarding this limit is here.

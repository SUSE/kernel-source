Subject: [PATCH] ksmbd: check iov vector index in ksmbd_conn_write()
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.71
Git-commit: 73f949ea87c7d697210653501ca21efe57295327

[ Upstream commit 73f949ea87c7d697210653501ca21efe57295327 ]

If ->iov_idx is zero, This means that the iov vector for the response
was not added during the request process. In other words, it means that
there is a problem in generating a response, So this patch return as
an error to avoid NULL pointer dereferencing problem.

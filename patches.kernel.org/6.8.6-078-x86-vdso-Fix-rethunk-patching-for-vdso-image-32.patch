Subject: [PATCH] x86/vdso: Fix rethunk patching for vdso-image-{32,64}.o
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.6
Git-commit: b388e57d4628eb22782bdad4cd5b83ca87a1b7c9

[ Upstream commit b388e57d4628eb22782bdad4cd5b83ca87a1b7c9 ]

For CONFIG_RETHUNK kernels, objtool annotates all the function return
sites so they can be patched during boot.  By design, after
apply_returns() is called, all tail-calls to the compiler-generated
default return thunk (__x86_return_thunk) should be patched out and
replaced with whatever's needed for any mitigations (or lack thereof).

The commit

  4461438a8405 ("x86/retpoline: Ensure default return thunk isn't used at runtime")

adds a runtime check and a WARN_ONCE() if the default return thunk ever
gets executed after alternatives have been applied.  This warning is
a sanity check to make sure objtool and apply_returns() are doing their
job.

As Nathan reported, that check found something:

  Unpatched return thunk in use. This should not happen!

Boris debugged to find that the unpatched return site was in
init_vdso_image_64(), and its translation unit wasn't being analyzed by
objtool, so it never got annotated.  So it got ignored by
apply_returns().

This is only a minor issue, as this function is only called during boot.
Still, objtool needs full visibility to the kernel.  Fix it by enabling
objtool on vdso-image-{32,64}.o.

Note this problem can only be seen with !CONFIG_X86_KERNEL_IBT, as that
requires objtool to run individually on all translation units rather on
vmlinux.o.

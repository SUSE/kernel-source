Subject: [PATCH] f2fs: avoid victim selection from previous victim section
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: e219aecfd4b766c4e878a3769057e9809f7fcadc

[ Upstream commit e219aecfd4b766c4e878a3769057e9809f7fcadc ]

When f2fs chooses GC victim in large section & LFS mode,
next_victim_seg[gc_type] is referenced first. After segment is freed,
next_victim_seg[gc_type] has the next segment number.
However, next_victim_seg[gc_type] still has the last segment number
even after the last segment of section is freed. In this case, when f2fs
chooses a victim for the next GC round, the last segment of previous victim
section is chosen as a victim.

Initialize next_victim_seg[gc_type] to NULL_SEGNO for the last segment in
large section.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Avoid generating untracked files when running
 bpf selftests
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: 73b9075f334f5debf28646884a320b796b27768d

[ Upstream commit 73b9075f334f5debf28646884a320b796b27768d ]

Currently, when we run the BPF selftests with the following command:

  make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=bpf SKIP_TARGETS=""

The command generates untracked files and directories with make version
less than 4.4:

'''
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	tools/testing/selftests/bpfFEATURE-DUMP.selftests
	tools/testing/selftests/bpffeature/
'''

We lost slash after word "bpf". The reason is slash appending code is as
follow:

'''
OUTPUT := $(OUTPUT)/
$(eval include ../../../build/Makefile.feature)
OUTPUT := $(patsubst %/,%,$(OUTPUT))
'''

This way of assigning values to OUTPUT will never be effective for the
variable OUTPUT provided via the command argument [1] and BPF makefile
is called from parent Makfile(tools/testing/selftests/Makefile) like:

'''
all:
  ...
	$(MAKE) OUTPUT=$$BUILD_TARGET -C $$TARGET
'''

According to GNU make, we can use override Directive to fix this issue [2].

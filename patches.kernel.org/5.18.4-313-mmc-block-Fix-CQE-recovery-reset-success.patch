Subject: [PATCH] mmc: block: Fix CQE recovery reset success
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.4
Git-commit: a051246b786af7e4a9d9219cc7038a6e8a411531

commit a051246b786af7e4a9d9219cc7038a6e8a411531 upstream.

The intention of the use of mmc_blk_reset_success() in
mmc_blk_cqe_recovery() was to prevent repeated resets when retrying and
getting the same error. However, that may not be the case - any amount
of time and I/O may pass before another recovery is needed, in which
case there would be no reason to deny it the opportunity to recover via
a reset if necessary. CQE recovery is expected seldom and failure to
recover (if the clear tasks command fails), even more seldom, so it is
better to allow the reset always, which can be done by calling
mmc_blk_reset_success() always.

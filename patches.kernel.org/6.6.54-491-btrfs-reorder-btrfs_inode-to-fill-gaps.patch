Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: reorder btrfs_inode to fill gaps
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.54
Git-commit: 398fb9131f31bd25aa187613c9942f4232e952b7

[ Upstream commit 398fb9131f31bd25aa187613c9942f4232e952b7 ]

Previous commit created a hole in struct btrfs_inode, we can move
outstanding_extents there. This reduces size by 8 bytes from 1120 to
1112 on a release config.

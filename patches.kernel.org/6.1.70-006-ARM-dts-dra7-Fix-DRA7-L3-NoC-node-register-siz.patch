Patch-mainline: 6.1.70
Git-commit: 1e5caee2ba8f1426e8098afb4ca38dc40a0ca71b

[ Upstream commit 1e5caee2ba8f1426e8098afb4ca38dc40a0ca71b ]

This node can access any part of the L3 configuration registers space,
including CLK1 and CLK2 which are 0x800000 offset. Restore this area
size to include these areas.

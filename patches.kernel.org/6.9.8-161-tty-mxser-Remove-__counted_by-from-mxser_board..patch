Subject: [PATCH] tty: mxser: Remove __counted_by from mxser_board.ports[]
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.8
Git-commit: 1c07c9be87dd3dd0634033bf08728b32465f08fb

commit 1c07c9be87dd3dd0634033bf08728b32465f08fb upstream.

Work for __counted_by on generic pointers in structures (not just
flexible array members) has started landing in Clang 19 (current tip of
tree). During the development of this feature, a restriction was added
to __counted_by to prevent the flexible array member's element type from
including a flexible array member itself such as:

  struct foo {
    int count;
    char buf[];
  };

  struct bar {
    int count;
    struct foo data[] __counted_by(count);
  };

because the size of data cannot be calculated with the standard array
size formula:

  sizeof(struct foo) * count

This restriction was downgraded to a warning but due to CONFIG_WERROR,
it can still break the build. The application of __counted_by on the
ports member of 'struct mxser_board' triggers this restriction,
resulting in:

  drivers/tty/mxser.c:291:2: error: 'counted_by' should not be applied to an array with element of unknown size because 'struct mxser_port' is a struct type with a flexible array member. This will be an error in a future compiler version [-Werror,-Wbounds-safety-counted-by-elt-type-unknown-size]
    291 |         struct mxser_port ports[] __counted_by(nports);
        |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 error generated.

Remove this use of __counted_by to fix the warning/error. However,
rather than remove it altogether, leave it commented, as it may be
possible to support this in future compiler releases.

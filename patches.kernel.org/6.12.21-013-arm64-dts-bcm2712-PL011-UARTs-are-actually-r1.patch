Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: bcm2712: PL011 UARTs are actually r1p5
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.21
Git-commit: 768953614c1c13fdf771be5742f1be573eea8fa4

[ Upstream commit 768953614c1c13fdf771be5742f1be573eea8fa4 ]

The ARM PL011 UART instances in BCM2712 are r1p5 spec, which means they
have 32-entry FIFOs. The correct periphid value for this is 0x00341011.
Thanks to N Buchwitz for pointing this out.

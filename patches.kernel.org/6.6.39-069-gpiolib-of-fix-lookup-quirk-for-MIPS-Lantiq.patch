Subject: [PATCH] gpiolib: of: fix lookup quirk for MIPS Lantiq
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.39
Git-commit: 3645ffaf2b334abaf5f53e5ca0f47465d91e69d2

[ Upstream commit 3645ffaf2b334abaf5f53e5ca0f47465d91e69d2 ]

As it turns out, there is a large number of out-of-tree DTSes (in
OpenWrt project) that used to specify incorrect (active high) polarity
for the Lantiq reset GPIO, so to keep compatibility while they are
being updated a quirk for force the polarity low is needed. Luckily
these old DTSes used nonstandard name for the property ("gpio-reset" vs
"reset-gpios") so the quirk will not hurt if there are any new devices
that need inverted polarity as they can specify the right polarity in
their DTS when using the standard "reset-gpios" property.

Additionally the condition to enable the transition from standard to
non-standard reset GPIO property name was inverted and the replacement
name for the property was not correct. Fix this as well.

Fixes: fbbbcd177a27 ("gpiolib: of: add quirk for locating reset lines with legacy bindings")
Fixes: 90c2d2eb7ab5 ("MIPS: pci: lantiq: switch to using gpiod API")

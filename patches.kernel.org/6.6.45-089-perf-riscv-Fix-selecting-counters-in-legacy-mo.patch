Subject: [PATCH] perf: riscv: Fix selecting counters in legacy mode
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.45
Git-commit: 941a8e9b7a86763ac52d5bf6ccc9986d37fde628

[ Upstream commit 941a8e9b7a86763ac52d5bf6ccc9986d37fde628 ]

It is required to check event type before checking event config.
Events with the different types can have the same config.
This check is missed for legacy mode code

For such perf usage:
    sysctl -w kernel.perf_user_access=2
    perf stat -e cycles,L1-dcache-loads --
driver will try to force both events to CYCLE counter.

This commit implements event type check before forcing
events on the special counters.

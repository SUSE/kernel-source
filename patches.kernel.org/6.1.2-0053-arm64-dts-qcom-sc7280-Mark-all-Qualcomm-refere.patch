Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Mark all Qualcomm reference boards
 as LTE
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 3c800bcf07a5957da01593e8f83d797b285a37e0

[ Upstream commit 3c800bcf07a5957da01593e8f83d797b285a37e0 ]

When the modem node was re-located to a separate LTE source file
"sc7280-herobrine-lte-sku.dtsi", some of the previous LTE users
weren't marked appropriately. Fix this by marking all Qualcomm
reference devices as LTE.

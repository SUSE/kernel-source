Subject: [PATCH] rbd: always kick acquire on "acquired" and "released"
 notifications
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.6
Git-commit: 8798d070d416d18a75770fc19787e96705073f43

commit 8798d070d416d18a75770fc19787e96705073f43 upstream.

Skipping the "lock has been released" notification if the lock owner
is not what we expect based on owner_cid can lead to I/O hangs.
One example is our own notifications: because owner_cid is cleared
in rbd_unlock(), when we get our own notification it is processed as
unexpected/duplicate and maybe_kick_acquire() isn't called.  If a peer
that requested the lock then doesn't go through with acquiring it,
I/O requests that came in while the lock was being quiesced would
be stalled until another I/O request is submitted and kicks acquire
from rbd_img_exclusive_lock().

This makes the comment in rbd_release_lock() actually true: prior to
this change the canceled work was being requeued in response to the
"lock has been acquired" notification from rbd_handle_acquired_lock().

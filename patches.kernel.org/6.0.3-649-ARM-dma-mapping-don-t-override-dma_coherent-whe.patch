Subject: [PATCH] ARM/dma-mapping: don't override ->dma_coherent when set from

[ Upstream commit 49bc8bebae79c8516cb12f91818f3a7907e3ebce ]

Commit ae626eb97376 ("ARM/dma-mapping: use dma-direct unconditionally")
caused a regression on the mvebu platform, wherein devices that are
dma-coherent are marked as dma-noncoherent, because although
mvebu_hwcc_notifier() after that commit still marks then as coherent,
the arm_coherent_dma_ops() function, which is called later, overwrites
this setting, since it is being called from drivers/of/device.c with
coherency parameter determined by of_dma_is_coherent(), and the
device-trees do not declare the 'dma-coherent' property.

Fix this by defaulting never clearing the dma_coherent flag in
arm_coherent_dma_ops().

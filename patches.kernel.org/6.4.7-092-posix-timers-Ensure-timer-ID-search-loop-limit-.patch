Subject: [PATCH] posix-timers: Ensure timer ID search-loop limit is valid
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.7
Git-commit: 8ce8849dd1e78dadcee0ec9acbd259d239b7069f

[ Upstream commit 8ce8849dd1e78dadcee0ec9acbd259d239b7069f ]

posix_timer_add() tries to allocate a posix timer ID by starting from the
cached ID which was stored by the last successful allocation.

This is done in a loop searching the ID space for a free slot one by
one. The loop has to terminate when the search wrapped around to the
starting point.

But that's racy vs. establishing the starting point. That is read out
lockless, which leads to the following problem:

CPU0	  	      	     	   CPU1
posix_timer_add()
  start = sig->posix_timer_id;
  lock(hash_lock);
  ...				   posix_timer_add()
  if (++sig->posix_timer_id < 0)
      			             start = sig->posix_timer_id;
     sig->posix_timer_id = 0;

So CPU1 can observe a negative start value, i.e. -1, and the loop break
never happens because the condition can never be true:

  if (sig->posix_timer_id == start)
     break;

While this is unlikely to ever turn into an endless loop as the ID space is
huge (INT_MAX), the racy read of the start value caught the attention of
KCSAN and Dmitry unearthed that incorrectness.

Rewrite it so that all id operations are under the hash lock.

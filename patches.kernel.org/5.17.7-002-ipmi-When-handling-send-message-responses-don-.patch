Subject: [PATCH] ipmi: When handling send message responses, don't process the
 message
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.7
Git-commit: 3d092ef09303e615707dc5755cf0e29b4df7555f

commit 3d092ef09303e615707dc5755cf0e29b4df7555f upstream.

A chunk was dropped when the code handling send messages was rewritten.
Those messages shouldn't be processed normally, they are just an
indication that the message was successfully sent and the timers should
be started for the real response that should be coming later.

Add back in the missing chunk to just discard the message and go on.

Fixes: 059747c245f0 ("ipmi: Add support for IPMB direct messages")

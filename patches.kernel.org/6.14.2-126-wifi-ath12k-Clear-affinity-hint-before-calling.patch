Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath12k: Clear affinity hint before calling
 ath12k_pci_free_irq() in error path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: b43b1e2c52db77c872bd60d30cdcc72c47df70c7

[ Upstream commit b43b1e2c52db77c872bd60d30cdcc72c47df70c7 ]

If a shared IRQ is used by the driver due to platform limitation, then the
IRQ affinity hint is set right after the allocation of IRQ vectors in
ath12k_pci_msi_alloc(). This does no harm unless one of the functions
requesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ.

This may end up with a warning from the IRQ core that is expecting the
affinity hint to be cleared before freeing the IRQ:

kernel/irq/manage.c:

	/* make sure affinity_hint is cleaned up */
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(desc->affinity_hint))
		desc->affinity_hint = NULL;

So to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling
ath12k_pci_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once
again further down the error path due to code organization, but that does
no harm.

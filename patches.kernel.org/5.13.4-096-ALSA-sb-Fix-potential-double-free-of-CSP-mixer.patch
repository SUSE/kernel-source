Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: sb: Fix potential double-free of CSP mixer elements
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: c305366a37441c2ac90b08711cb6f032b43672f2

[ Upstream commit c305366a37441c2ac90b08711cb6f032b43672f2 ]

snd_sb_qsound_destroy() contains the calls of removing the previously
created mixer controls, but it doesn't clear the pointers.  As
snd_sb_qsound_destroy() itself may be repeatedly called via ioctl,
this could lead to double-free potentially.

Fix it by clearing the struct fields properly afterwards.

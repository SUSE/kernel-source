Subject: [PATCH] leds: leds-lp55xx: Use correct address for memory programming
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.3
Git-commit: d6058316d16ee0d1861c0550051b2492efb54b79

[ Upstream commit d6058316d16ee0d1861c0550051b2492efb54b79 ]

Memory programming doesn't work for devices without page support.
For example, LP5562 has 3 engines but doesn't support pages,
the start address is changed depending on engine number.
According to datasheet [1], the PROG MEM register addresses for each
engine are as follows:

  Engine 1: 0x10
  Engine 2: 0x30
  Engine 3: 0x50

However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the address
of PROG MEM register using the engine index starting from 1:

  prog_mem_base = 0x10
  LP55xx_BYTES_PER_PAGE = 0x20

  Engine 1: 0x10 + 0x20 * 1 = 0x30
  Engine 2: 0x10 + 0x20 * 2 = 0x50
  Engine 3: 0x10 + 0x20 * 3 = 0x70

This results in writing to the wrong engine memory, causing pattern
programming to fail.

To correct it, the engine index should be decreased:
  Engine 1: 0x10 + 0x20 * 0 = 0x10
  Engine 2: 0x10 + 0x20 * 1 = 0x30
  Engine 3: 0x10 + 0x20 * 2 = 0x50

Subject: [PATCH] 9p: explicitly deny setlease attempts
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.31
Git-commit: 7a84602297d36617dbdadeba55a2567031e5165b

[ Upstream commit 7a84602297d36617dbdadeba55a2567031e5165b ]

9p is a remote network protocol, and it doesn't support asynchronous
notifications from the server. Ensure that we don't hand out any leases
since we can't guarantee they'll be broken when a file's contents
change.

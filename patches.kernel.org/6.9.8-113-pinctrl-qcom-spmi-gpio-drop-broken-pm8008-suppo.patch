Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: qcom: spmi-gpio: drop broken pm8008 support
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.8
Git-commit: 8da86499d4cd125a9561f9cd1de7fba99b0aecbf

commit 8da86499d4cd125a9561f9cd1de7fba99b0aecbf upstream.

The SPMI GPIO driver assumes that the parent device is an SPMI device
and accesses random data when backcasting the parent struct device
pointer for non-SPMI devices.

Fortunately this does not seem to cause any issues currently when the
parent device is an I2C client like the PM8008, but this could change if
the structures are reorganised (e.g. using structure randomisation).

Notably the interrupt implementation is also broken for non-SPMI devices.

Also note that the two GPIO pins on PM8008 are used for interrupts and
reset so their practical use should be limited.

Drop the broken GPIO support for PM8008 for now.

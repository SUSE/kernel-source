Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: cs35l56: Must clear HALO_STATE before issuing
 SYSTEM_RESET
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.9
Git-commit: e33625c84b75e4f078d7f9bf58f01fe71ab99642

[ Upstream commit e33625c84b75e4f078d7f9bf58f01fe71ab99642 ]

The driver must write 0 to HALO_STATE before sending the SYSTEM_RESET
command to the firmware.

HALO_STATE is in DSP memory, which is preserved across a soft reset.
The SYSTEM_RESET command does not change the value of HALO_STATE.
There is period of time while the CS35L56 is resetting, before the
firmware has started to boot, where a read of HALO_STATE will return
the value it had before the SYSTEM_RESET. If the driver does not
clear HALO_STATE, this would return BOOT_DONE status even though the
firmware has not booted.

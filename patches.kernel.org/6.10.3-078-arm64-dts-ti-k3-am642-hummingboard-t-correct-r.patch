Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am642-hummingboard-t: correct rs485 rts
 polarity
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 9dcc0e1065f3c40d0b2ad79a858bb4ebaba33167

[ Upstream commit 9dcc0e1065f3c40d0b2ad79a858bb4ebaba33167 ]

The RS485 transceiver RE (Receiver enable) and DE (Driver enable) are
shorted and connected to both RTS/CTS of the SoC UART.
RE is active-low, DE is active-high.

Remove the "rs485-rts-active-low" flag to match RTS polarity with DE,
and fix communication in both transmit and receive directions.

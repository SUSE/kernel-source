Subject: [PATCH] perf: arm_cspmu: Reject events meant for other PMUs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.3
Git-commit: 15c7ef7341a2e54cfa12ac502c65d6fd2cce2b62

commit 15c7ef7341a2e54cfa12ac502c65d6fd2cce2b62 upstream.

Coresight PMU driver didn't reject events meant for other PMUs.
This caused some of the Core PMU events disappearing from
the output of "perf list". In addition, trying to run e.g.

     $ perf stat -e r2 sleep 1

made Coresight PMU driver to handle the event instead of letting
Core PMU driver to deal with it.

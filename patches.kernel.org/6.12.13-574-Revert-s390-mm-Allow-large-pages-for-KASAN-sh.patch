Subject: [PATCH] Revert "s390/mm: Allow large pages for KASAN shadow mapping"
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: cc00550b2ae7ab1c7c56669fc004a13d880aaf0a

commit cc00550b2ae7ab1c7c56669fc004a13d880aaf0a upstream.

This reverts commit ff123eb7741638d55abf82fac090bb3a543c1e74.

Allowing large pages for KASAN shadow mappings isn't inherently wrong,
but adding POPULATE_KASAN_MAP_SHADOW to large_allowed() exposes an issue
in can_large_pud() and can_large_pmd().

Since commit d8073dc6bc04 ("s390/mm: Allow large pages only for aligned
physical addresses"), both can_large_pud() and can_large_pmd() call _pa()
to check if large page physical addresses are aligned. However, _pa()
has a side effect: it allocates memory in POPULATE_KASAN_MAP_SHADOW
mode. This results in massive memory leaks.

The proper fix would be to address both large_allowed() and _pa()'s side
effects, but for now, revert this change to avoid the leaks.

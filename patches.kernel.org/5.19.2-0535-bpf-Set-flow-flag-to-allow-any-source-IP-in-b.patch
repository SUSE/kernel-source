Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Set flow flag to allow any source IP in bpf_tunnel_key
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: b8fff748521c7178b9a7d32b5a34a81cec8396f3

[ Upstream commit b8fff748521c7178b9a7d32b5a34a81cec8396f3 ]

Commit 26101f5ab6bd ("bpf: Add source ip in "struct bpf_tunnel_key"")
added support for getting and setting the outer source IP of encapsulated
packets via the bpf_skb_{get,set}_tunnel_key BPF helper. This change
allows BPF programs to set any IP address as the source, including for
example the IP address of a container running on the same host.

In that last case, however, the encapsulated packets are dropped when
looking up the route because the source IP address isn't assigned to any
interface on the host. To avoid this, we need to set the
FLOWI_FLAG_ANYSRC flag.

Subject: [PATCH] dm-delay: fix max_delay calculations
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: 64eb88d6caee2c8eb806a68dab3f184f14f818a4

[ Upstream commit 64eb88d6caee2c8eb806a68dab3f184f14f818a4 ]

delay_ctr() pointlessly compared max_delay in cases where multiple delay
classes were initialized identically. Also, when write delays were
configured different than read delays, delay_ctr() never compared their
value against max_delay. Fix these issues.

Fixes: 70bbeb29fab0 ("dm delay: for short delays, use kthread instead of timers and wq")

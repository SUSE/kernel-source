Subject: [PATCH] Docs/admin-guide/mm/damon/usage: fix wrong example of DAMOS
 filter matching sysfs file
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.2
Git-commit: da2a061888883e067e8e649d086df35c92c760a7

commit da2a061888883e067e8e649d086df35c92c760a7 upstream.

The example usage of DAMOS filter sysfs files, specifically the part of
'matching' file writing for memcg type filter, is wrong.  The intention is
to exclude pages of a memcg that already getting enough care from a given
scheme, but the example is setting the filter to apply the scheme to only
the pages of the memcg.  Fix it.

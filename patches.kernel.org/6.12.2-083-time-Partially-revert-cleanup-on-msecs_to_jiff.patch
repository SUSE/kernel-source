Subject: [PATCH] time: Partially revert cleanup on msecs_to_jiffies()
 documentation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: b05aefc1f5886c8aece650c9c1639c87b976191a

[ Upstream commit b05aefc1f5886c8aece650c9c1639c87b976191a ]

The documentation's intention is to compare msecs_to_jiffies() (first
sentence) with __msecs_to_jiffies() (second sentence), which is what the
original documentation did. One of the cleanups in commit f3cb80804b82
("time: Fix various kernel-doc problems") may have thought the paragraph
was talking about the latter since that is what it is being documented.

Thus revert that part of the change.

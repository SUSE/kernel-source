Subject: [PATCH] rtla/timerlat_hist: Abort event processing on second signal
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.16
Git-commit: d6899e560366e10141189697502bc5521940c588

[ Upstream commit d6899e560366e10141189697502bc5521940c588 ]

If either SIGINT is received twice, or after a SIGALRM (that is, after
timerlat was supposed to stop), abort processing events currently left
in the tracefs buffer and exit immediately.

This allows the user to exit rtla without waiting for processing all
events, should that take longer than wanted, at the cost of not
processing all samples.

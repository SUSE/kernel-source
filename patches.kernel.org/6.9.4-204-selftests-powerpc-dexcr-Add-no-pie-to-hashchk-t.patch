Subject: [PATCH] selftests/powerpc/dexcr: Add -no-pie to hashchk tests
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.4
Git-commit: d7228a58d9438d6f219dc7f33eab0d1980b3bd2f

[ Upstream commit d7228a58d9438d6f219dc7f33eab0d1980b3bd2f ]

The hashchk tests want to verify that the hash key is changed over exec.
It does so by calculating hashes at the same address across an exec.
This is made simpler by disabling PIE functionality, so we can
re-execute ourselves and be using the same addresses in the child.

While -fno-pie is already added, -no-pie is also required.

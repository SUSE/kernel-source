Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: count CLOSE-WAIT sockets for MPTCP_MIB_CURRESTAB
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.6
Git-commit: 9633e9377e6af0244f7381e86b9aac5276f5be97

[ Upstream commit 9633e9377e6af0244f7381e86b9aac5276f5be97 ]

Like previous patch does in TCP, we need to adhere to RFC 1213:

  "tcpCurrEstab OBJECT-TYPE
   ...
   The number of TCP connections for which the current state
   is either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE- WAIT."

So let's consider CLOSE-WAIT sockets.

The logic of counting
When we increment the counter?
a) Only if we change the state to ESTABLISHED.

When we decrement the counter?
a) if the socket leaves ESTABLISHED and will never go into CLOSE-WAIT,
say, on the client side, changing from ESTABLISHED to FIN-WAIT-1.
b) if the socket leaves CLOSE-WAIT, say, on the server side, changing
from CLOSE-WAIT to LAST-ACK.

Subject: [PATCH] block: define bvec_iter as __packed __aligned(4)
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.9
Git-commit: 7838b4656110d950afdd92a081cc0f33e23e0ea8

[ Upstream commit 7838b4656110d950afdd92a081cc0f33e23e0ea8 ]

In commit 19416123ab3e ("block: define 'struct bvec_iter' as packed"),
what we need is to save the 4byte padding, and avoid `bio` to spread on
one extra cache line.

It is enough to define it as '__packed __aligned(4)', as '__packed'
alone means byte aligned, and can cause compiler to generate horrible
code on architectures that don't support unaligned access in case that
bvec_iter is embedded in other structures.

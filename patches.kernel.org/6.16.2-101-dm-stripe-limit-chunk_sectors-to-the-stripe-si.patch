Subject: [PATCH] dm-stripe: limit chunk_sectors to the stripe size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: 5fb9d4341b782a80eefa0dc1664d131ac3c8885d

[ Upstream commit 5fb9d4341b782a80eefa0dc1664d131ac3c8885d ]

Same as done for raid0, set chunk_sectors limit to appropriately set the
atomic write size limit.

Setting chunk_sectors limit in this way overrides the stacked limit
already calculated based on the bottom device limits. This is ok, as
when any bios are sent to the bottom devices, the block layer will still
respect the bottom device chunk_sectors.

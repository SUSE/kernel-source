Subject: [PATCH] scsi: sd: Fix VPD page 0xb7 length check
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.6
Git-commit: 8889676cd62161896f1d861ce294adc29c4f2cb5

[ Upstream commit 8889676cd62161896f1d861ce294adc29c4f2cb5 ]

sd_read_block_limits_ext() currently assumes that vpd->len excludes the
size of the page header. However, vpd->len describes the size of the entire
VPD page, therefore the sanity check is incorrect.

In practice this is not really a problem since we don't attach VPD
pages unless they actually report data trailing the header. But fix
the length check regardless.

This issue was identified by Wukong-Agent (formerly Tencent Woodpecker), a
code security AI agent, through static code analysis.

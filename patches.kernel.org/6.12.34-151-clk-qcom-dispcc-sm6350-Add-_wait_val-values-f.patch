Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: dispcc-sm6350: Add *_wait_val values for GDSCs
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.34
Git-commit: 673989d27123618afab56df1143a75454178b4ae

[ Upstream commit 673989d27123618afab56df1143a75454178b4ae ]

Compared to the msm-4.19 driver the mainline GDSC driver always sets the
bits for en_rest, en_few & clk_dis, and if those values are not set
per-GDSC in the respective driver then the default value from the GDSC
driver is used. The downstream driver only conditionally sets
clk_dis_wait_val if qcom,clk-dis-wait-val is given in devicetree.

Correct this situation by explicitly setting those values. For all GDSCs
the reset value of those bits are used.

Subject: [PATCH] bpf, sockmap: Remove unhash handler for BPF sockmap usage
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: b8b8315e39ffaca82e79d86dde26e9144addf66b

[ Upstream commit b8b8315e39ffaca82e79d86dde26e9144addf66b ]

We do not need to handle unhash from BPF side we can simply wait for the
close to happen. The original concern was a socket could transition from
ESTABLISHED state to a new state while the BPF hook was still attached.
But, we convinced ourself this is no longer possible and we also improved
BPF sockmap to handle listen sockets so this is no longer a problem.

More importantly though there are cases where unhash is called when data is
in the receive queue. The BPF unhash logic will flush this data which is
wrong. To be correct it should keep the data in the receive queue and allow
a receiving application to continue reading the data. This may happen when
tcp_abort() is received for example. Instead of complicating the logic in
unhash simply moving all this to tcp_close() hook solves this.

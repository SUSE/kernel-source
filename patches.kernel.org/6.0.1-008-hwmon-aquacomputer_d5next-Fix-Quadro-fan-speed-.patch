Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: (aquacomputer_d5next) Fix Quadro fan speed offsets
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.1
Git-commit: b7f3e9650f12d1e06b94a0257bcb90279f691bf5

commit b7f3e9650f12d1e06b94a0257bcb90279f691bf5 upstream.

The offsets for setting speeds of fans connected to Quadro are off by one.
Set them to their correct values.

The offsets as shown point to registers for setting the fan control mode,
which will be explored in future patches, but slipped in here. When
setting fan speeds, the resulting values were overlapping, which made the
fans still run in my initial testing.

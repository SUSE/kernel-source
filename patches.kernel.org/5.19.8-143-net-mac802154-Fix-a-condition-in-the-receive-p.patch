Subject: [PATCH] net: mac802154: Fix a condition in the receive path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.8
Git-commit: f0da47118c7e93cdbbc6fb403dd729a5f2c90ee3

commit f0da47118c7e93cdbbc6fb403dd729a5f2c90ee3 upstream.

Upon reception, a packet must be categorized, either it's destination is
the host, or it is another host. A packet with no destination addressing
fields may be valid in two situations:
- the packet has no source field: only ACKs are built like that, we
  consider the host as the destination.
- the packet has a valid source field: it is directed to the PAN
  coordinator, as for know we don't have this information we consider we
  are not the PAN coordinator.

There was likely a copy/paste error made during a previous cleanup
because the if clause is now containing exactly the same condition as in
the switch case, which can never be true. In the past the destination
address was used in the switch and the source address was used in the
if, which matches what the spec says.

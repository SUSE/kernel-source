[ Upstream commit 3392ef368d9b04622fe758b1079b512664b6110a ]

This fixes:
arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm47189-luxul-xap-1440.dtb: pcie@2000: '#address-cells' is a required property
        From schema: /lib/python3.10/site-packages/dtschema/schemas/pci/pci-bus.yaml
arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm47189-luxul-xap-1440.dtb: pcie@2000: '#size-cells' is a required property
        From schema: /lib/python3.10/site-packages/dtschema/schemas/pci/pci-bus.yaml

Two properties that need to be added later are "device_type" and
"ranges". Adding "device_type" on its own causes a new warning and the
value of "ranges" needs to be determined yet.

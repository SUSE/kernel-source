commit 8aa83e6395ce047a506f0b16edca45f36c1ae7f8 upstream.

Commit in Fixes introduced early_reserve_memory() to do all needed
initial memblock_reserve() calls in one function. Unfortunately, the call
of early_reserve_memory() is done too late for Xen dom0, as in some
cases a Xen hook called by e820__memory_setup() will need those memory
reservations to have happened already.

Move the call of early_reserve_memory() before the call of
e820__memory_setup() in order to avoid such problems.

Fixes: a799c2bd29d1 ("x86/setup: Consolidate early memory reservations")

 access

commit 2796728460b822d549841e0341752b263dc265c4 upstream.

Realtek switches in the rtl8365mb family can access the PHY registers of
the internal PHYs via the switch registers. This method is called
indirect access. At a high level, the indirect PHY register access
method involves reading and writing some special switch registers in a
particular sequence. This works for both SMI and MDIO connected
switches.

Currently the rtl8365mb driver does not take any care to serialize the
aforementioned access to the switch registers. In particular, it is
permitted for other driver code to access other switch registers while
the indirect PHY register access is ongoing. Locking is only done at the
regmap level. This, however, is a bug: concurrent register access, even
to unrelated switch registers, risks corrupting the PHY register value
read back via the indirect access method described above.

Arınç reported that the switch sometimes returns nonsense data when
reading the PHY registers. In particular, a value of 0 causes the
kernel's PHY subsystem to think that the link is down, but since most
reads return correct data, the link then flip-flops between up and down
over a period of time.

The aforementioned bug can be readily observed by:

 1. Enabling ftrace events for regmap and mdio
 2. Polling BSMR PHY register for a connected port;
    it should always read the same (e.g. 0x79ed)
 3. Wait for step 2 to give a different value

Example command for step 2:

    while true; do phytool read swp2/2/0x01; done

On my i.MX8MM, the above steps will yield a bogus value for the BSMR PHY
register within a matter of seconds. The interleaved register access it
then evident in the trace log:

The kworker here is polling MIB counters for stats, as evidenced by the
register 0x1004 that we are writing to (RTL8365MB_MIB_ADDRESS_REG). This
polling is performed every 3 seconds, but is just one example of such
unsynchronized access. In Arınç's case, the driver was not using the
switch IRQ, so the PHY subsystem was itself doing polling analogous to
phytool in the above example.

A test module was created [see second Link] to simulate such spurious
switch register accesses while performing indirect PHY register reads
and writes. Realtek was also consulted to confirm whether this is a
known issue or not. The conclusion of these lines of inquiry is as
follows:

1. Reading of PHY registers via indirect access will be aborted if,
   after executing the read operation (via a write to the
   INDIRECT_ACCESS_CTRL_REG), any register is accessed, other than
   INDIRECT_ACCESS_STATUS_REG.

2. The PHY register indirect read is only complete when
   INDIRECT_ACCESS_STATUS_REG reads zero.

3. The INDIRECT_ACCESS_DATA_REG, which is read to get the result of the
   PHY read, will contain the result of the last successful read
   operation. If there was spurious register access and the indirect
   read was aborted, then this register is not guaranteed to hold
   anything meaningful and the PHY read will silently fail.

4. PHY writes do not appear to be affected by this mechanism.

5. Other similar access routines, such as for MIB counters, although
   similar to the PHY indirect access method, are actually table access.
   Table access is not affected by spurious reads or writes of other
   registers. However, concurrent table access is not allowed. Currently
   this is protected via mib_lock, so there is nothing to fix.

The above statements are corroborated both via the test module and
through consultation with Realtek. In particular, Realtek states that
this is simply a property of the hardware design and is not a hardware
bug.

To fix this problem, one must guard against regmap access while the
PHY indirect register read is executing. Fix this by using the newly
introduced "nolock" regmap in all PHY-related functions, and by aquiring
the regmap mutex at the top level of the PHY register access callbacks.
Although no issue has been observed with PHY register _writes_, this
change also serializes the indirect access method there. This is done
purely as a matter of convenience and for reasons of symmetry.

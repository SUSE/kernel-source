Subject: [PATCH] iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Add missing GMU entry to match table
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: afc95681c3068956fed1241a1ff1612c066c75ac

commit afc95681c3068956fed1241a1ff1612c066c75ac upstream.

In some cases the firmware expects cbndx 1 to be assigned to the GMU,
so we also want the default domain for the GMU to be an identy domain.
This way it does not get a context bank assigned.  Without this, both
of_dma_configure() and drm/msm's iommu_domain_attach() will trigger
allocating and configuring a context bank.  So GMU ends up attached to
both cbndx 1 and later cbndx 2.  This arrangement seemingly confounds
and surprises the firmware if the GPU later triggers a translation
fault, resulting (on sc8280xp / lenovo x13s, at least) in the SMMU
getting wedged and the GPU stuck without memory access.

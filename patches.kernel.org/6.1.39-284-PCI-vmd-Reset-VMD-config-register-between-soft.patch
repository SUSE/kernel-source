Subject: [PATCH] PCI: vmd: Reset VMD config register between soft reboots
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: b61cf04c49c3dfa70a0d6725d3eb40bf9b35cf71

[ Upstream commit b61cf04c49c3dfa70a0d6725d3eb40bf9b35cf71 ]

VMD driver can disable or enable MSI remapping by changing
VMCONFIG_MSI_REMAP register. This register needs to be set to the
default value during soft reboots. Drives failed to enumerate
when Windows boots after performing a soft reboot from Linux.
Windows doesn't support MSI remapping disable feature and stale
register value hinders Windows VMD driver initialization process.
Adding vmd_shutdown function to make sure to set the VMCONFIG
register to the default value.

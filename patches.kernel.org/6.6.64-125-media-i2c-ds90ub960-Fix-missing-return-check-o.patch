Subject: [PATCH] media: i2c: ds90ub960: Fix missing return check on
 ub960_rxport_read call
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.64
Git-commit: 24ad2d1f773a11f69eecec3ec37ea3d76f2e9e7d

[ Upstream commit 24ad2d1f773a11f69eecec3ec37ea3d76f2e9e7d ]

The function ub960_rxport_read is being called and afterwards ret is
being checked for any failures, however ret is not being assigned to
the return of the function call. Fix this by assigning ret to the
return of the call which appears to be missing.

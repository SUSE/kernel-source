Subject: [PATCH] Revert "wcn36xx: Enable firmware link monitoring"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: 43ea9bd84f27d06482cc823d9749cc9dd2993bc8

[ Upstream commit 43ea9bd84f27d06482cc823d9749cc9dd2993bc8 ]

Firmware link offload monitoring can be made to work in 3/4 cases by
switching on firmware feature bit WLANACTIVE_OFFLOAD

- Secure power-save on
- Secure power-save off
- Open power-save on

However, with an open AP if we switch off power-saving - thus never
entering Beacon Mode Power Save - BMPS, firmware never forwards loss
of beacon upwards.

We had hoped that WLANACTIVE_OFFLOAD and some fixes for sequence numbers
would unblock this but, it hasn't and further investigation is required.

Its possible to have a complete set of Secure power-save on/off and Open
power-save on/off provided we use Linux' link monitoring mechanism.

While we debug the Open AP failure we need to fix upstream.

This reverts commit c973fdad79f6eaf247d48b5fc77733e989eb01e1.

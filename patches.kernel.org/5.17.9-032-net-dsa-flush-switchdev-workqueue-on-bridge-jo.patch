Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: flush switchdev workqueue on bridge join error path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.9
Git-commit: 630fd4822af2374cd75c682b7665dcb367613765

[ Upstream commit 630fd4822af2374cd75c682b7665dcb367613765 ]

There is a race between switchdev_bridge_port_offload() and the
dsa_port_switchdev_sync_attrs() call right below it.

When switchdev_bridge_port_offload() finishes, FDB entries have been
replayed by the bridge, but are scheduled for deferred execution later.

However dsa_port_switchdev_sync_attrs -> dsa_port_can_apply_vlan_filtering()
may impose restrictions on the vlan_filtering attribute and refuse
offloading.

When this happens, the delayed FDB entries will dereference dp->bridge,
which is a NULL pointer because we have stopped the process of
offloading this bridge.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

Error: dsa_core: Must first remove VLAN uppers having VIDs also present in bridge.

Fix the bug by doing what we do on the normal bridge leave path as well,
which is to wait until the deferred FDB entries complete executing, then
exit.

The placement of dsa_flush_workqueue() after switchdev_bridge_port_unoffload()
guarantees that both the FDB additions and deletions on rollback are waited for.

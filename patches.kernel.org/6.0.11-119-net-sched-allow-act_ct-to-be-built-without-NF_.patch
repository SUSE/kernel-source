Subject: [PATCH] net: sched: allow act_ct to be built without NF_NAT
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.11
Git-commit: 8427fd100c7b7793650e212a81e42f1cf124613d

[ Upstream commit 8427fd100c7b7793650e212a81e42f1cf124613d ]

In commit f11fe1dae1c4 ("net/sched: Make NET_ACT_CT depends on NF_NAT"),
it fixed the build failure when NF_NAT is m and NET_ACT_CT is y by
adding depends on NF_NAT for NET_ACT_CT. However, it would also cause
NET_ACT_CT cannot be built without NF_NAT, which is not expected. This
patch fixes it by changing to use "(!NF_NAT || NF_NAT)" as the depend.

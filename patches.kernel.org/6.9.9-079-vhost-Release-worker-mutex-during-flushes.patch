Subject: [PATCH] vhost: Release worker mutex during flushes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.9
Git-commit: ba704ff4e142fd3cfaf3379dd3b3b946754e06e3

[ Upstream commit ba704ff4e142fd3cfaf3379dd3b3b946754e06e3 ]

In the next patches where the worker can be killed while in use, we
need to be able to take the worker mutex and kill queued works for
new IO and flushes, and set some new flags to prevent new
__vhost_vq_attach_worker calls from swapping in/out killed workers.

If we are holding the worker mutex during a flush and the flush's work
is still in the queue, the worker code that will handle the SIGKILL
cleanup won't be able to take the mutex and perform it's cleanup. So
this patch has us drop the worker mutex while waiting for the flush
to complete.

Subject: [PATCH] md: don't clear MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN for new dm-raid until
 resume
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: 2f03d0c2cd451c7ac2f317079d4ec518f0986b55

[ Upstream commit 2f03d0c2cd451c7ac2f317079d4ec518f0986b55 ]

After commit 9dbd1aa3a81c ("dm raid: add reshaping support to the
target") raid_ctr() will set MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN before md_run() and
expect to keep array frozen until resume. However, md_run() will clear
the flag by setting mddev->recovery to 0.

Before commit 1baae052cccd ("md: Don't ignore suspended array in
md_check_recovery()"), dm-raid actually relied on suspending to prevent
starting new sync_thread.

Fix this problem by keeping 'MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN' for dm-raid in
md_run().

Fixes: 1baae052cccd ("md: Don't ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery()")
Fixes: 9dbd1aa3a81c ("dm raid: add reshaping support to the target")

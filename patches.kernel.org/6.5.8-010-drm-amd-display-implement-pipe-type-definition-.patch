Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: implement pipe type definition and adding
 accessors
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.8
Git-commit: 53f3288079460ec7c86a39871af5c8b2a5d48685

commit 53f3288079460ec7c86a39871af5c8b2a5d48685 upstream.

[why]
There is a lack of encapsulation of pipe connection representation in pipe context.
This has caused many challenging bugs and coding errors with repeated
logic to identify the same pipe type.

[how]
Formally define pipe types and provide getters to identify a pipe type and
find a pipe based on specific requirements. Update existing logic in non dcn
specific files and dcn32 and future versions to use the new accessors.

+ * pipe types are identified based on MUXes in DCN front end that are capable

+ * in a form of XXXX_YYYY, where XXXX is the DCN front end hardware block the

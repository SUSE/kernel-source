Subject: [PATCH] x86/entry/64: Remove obsolete comment on tracing vs. SYSRET
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.41
Git-commit: eb43c9b1517b48e2ff0d3a584aca197338987d7b

[ Upstream commit eb43c9b1517b48e2ff0d3a584aca197338987d7b ]

This comment comes from a time when the kernel attempted to use SYSRET
on all returns to userspace, including interrupts and exceptions.  Ever
since commit fffbb5dc ("Move opportunistic sysret code to syscall code
path"), SYSRET is only used for returning from system calls. The
specific tracing issue listed in this comment is not possible anymore.

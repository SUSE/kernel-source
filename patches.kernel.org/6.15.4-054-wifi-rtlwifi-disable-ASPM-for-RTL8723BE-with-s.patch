Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtlwifi: disable ASPM for RTL8723BE with subsystem ID
 11ad:1723
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: 77a6407c6ab240527166fb19ee96e95f5be4d3cd

commit 77a6407c6ab240527166fb19ee96e95f5be4d3cd upstream.

RTL8723BE found on some ASUSTek laptops, such as F441U and X555UQ with
subsystem ID 11ad:1723 are known to output large amounts of PCIe AER
errors during and after boot up, causing heavy lags and at times lock-ups:

  pcieport 0000:00:1c.5: AER: Correctable error message received from 0000:00:1c.5
  pcieport 0000:00:1c.5: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Correctable, type=Physical Layer, (Receiver ID)
  pcieport 0000:00:1c.5:   device [8086:9d15] error status/mask=00000001/00002000
  pcieport 0000:00:1c.5:    [ 0] RxErr

Disable ASPM on this combo as a quirk.

This patch is a revision of a previous patch (linked below) which
attempted to disable ASPM for RTL8723BE on all Intel Skylake and Kaby Lake
PCIe bridges. I take a more conservative approach as all known reports
point to ASUSTek laptops of these two generations with this particular
wireless card.

Please note, however, before the rtl8723be finishes probing, the AER
errors remained. After the module finishes probing, all AER errors would
indeed be eliminated, along with heavy lags, poor network throughput,
and/or occasional lock-ups.

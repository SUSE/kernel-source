Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: Remove ill-placed consistency check
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: 59f60005797b4018d7b46620037e0c53d690795e

[ Upstream commit 59f60005797b4018d7b46620037e0c53d690795e ]

This consistency check was originally added by commit 9287c6452d2b1
("gfs2: Fix occasional glock use-after-free").  It is ill-placed in
gfs2_glock_free() because if it holds there, it must equally hold in
__gfs2_glock_put() already.  Either way, the check doesn't seem
necessary anymore.

Subject: [PATCH] ice: gather page_count()'s of each frag right before XDP prog
 call
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.14
Git-commit: 11c4aa074d547d825b19cd8d9f288254d89d805c

[ Upstream commit 11c4aa074d547d825b19cd8d9f288254d89d805c ]

If we store the pgcnt on few fragments while being in the middle of
gathering the whole frame and we stumbled upon DD bit not being set, we
terminate the NAPI Rx processing loop and come back later on. Then on
next NAPI execution we work on previously stored pgcnt.

Imagine that second half of page was used actively by networking stack
and by the time we came back, stack is not busy with this page anymore
and decremented the refcnt. The page reuse algorithm in this case should
be good to reuse the page but given the old refcnt it will not do so and
attempt to release the page via page_frag_cache_drain() with
pagecnt_bias used as an arg. This in turn will result in negative refcnt
on struct page, which was initially observed by Xu Du.

Therefore, move the page count storage from ice_get_rx_buf() to a place
where we are sure that whole frame has been collected, but before
calling XDP program as it internally can also change the page count of
fragments belonging to xdp_buff.

Subject: [PATCH] power: supply: axp288_charger: Use
 acpi_quirk_skip_acpi_ac_and_battery()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.3
Git-commit: 00d0566614b7bb7b226cb5a6895b0180ffe6915a

[ Upstream commit 00d0566614b7bb7b226cb5a6895b0180ffe6915a ]

Normally the native AXP288 fg/charger drivers are preferred but one some
devices the ACPI drivers should be used instead.

The ACPI battery/ac drivers use the acpi_quirk_skip_acpi_ac_and_battery()
helper to determine if they should skip loading because native fuel-gauge/
charger drivers like the AXP288 drivers will be used.

The new acpi_quirk_skip_acpi_ac_and_battery() helper includes a list of
exceptions for boards where the ACPI drivers should be used instead.

Use this new helper to avoid loading on such boards. Note this requires
adding a Kconfig dependency on ACPI, this is not a problem because ACPI
should be enabled on all boards with an AXP288 PMIC anyways.

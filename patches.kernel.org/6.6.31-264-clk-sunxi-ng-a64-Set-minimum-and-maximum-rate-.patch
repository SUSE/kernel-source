Subject: [PATCH] clk: sunxi-ng: a64: Set minimum and maximum rate for PLL-MIPI
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.31
Git-commit: 69f16d9b789821183d342719d2ebd4a5ac7178bc

commit 69f16d9b789821183d342719d2ebd4a5ac7178bc upstream.

When the Allwinner A64's TCON0 searches the ideal rate for the connected
panel, it may happen that it requests a rate from its parent PLL-MIPI
which PLL-MIPI does not support.

This happens for example on the Olimex TERES-I laptop where TCON0
requests PLL-MIPI to change to a rate of several GHz which causes the
panel to stay blank. It also happens on the pinephone where a rate of
less than 500 MHz is requested which causes instabilities on some
phones.

Set the minimum and maximum rate of Allwinner A64's PLL-MIPI according
to the Allwinner User Manual.

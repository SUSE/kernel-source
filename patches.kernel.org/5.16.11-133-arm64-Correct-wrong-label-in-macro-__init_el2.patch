Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Correct wrong label in macro __init_el2_gicv3
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.11
Git-commit: 4f6de676d94ee8ddfc2e7e7cd935fc7cb2feff3a

commit 4f6de676d94ee8ddfc2e7e7cd935fc7cb2feff3a upstream.

In commit:

  114945d84a30a5fe ("arm64: Fix labels in el2_setup macros")

We renamed a label from '1' to '.Lskip_gicv3_\@', but failed to update
a branch to it, which now targets a later label also called '1'.

The branch is taken rarely, when GICv3 is present but SRE is disabled
at EL3, causing a boot-time crash.

Update the caller to the new label name.

Fixes: 114945d84a30 ("arm64: Fix labels in el2_setup macros")

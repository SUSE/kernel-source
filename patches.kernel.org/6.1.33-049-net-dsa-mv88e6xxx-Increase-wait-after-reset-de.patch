Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Increase wait after reset deactivation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.33
Git-commit: 3c27f3d53d588618d81d30d6712459a3cc9489b8

[ Upstream commit 3c27f3d53d588618d81d30d6712459a3cc9489b8 ]

A switch held in reset by default needs to wait longer until we can
reliably detect it.

An issue was observed when testing on the Marvell 88E6393X (Link Street).
The driver failed to detect the switch on some upstarts. Increasing the
wait time after reset deactivation solves this issue.

The updated wait time is now also the same as the wait time in the
mv88e6xxx_hardware_reset function.

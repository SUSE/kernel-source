Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Add avdd HDMI supplies to RockPro64
 board dtsi
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.36
Git-commit: bd1c959f37f384b477f51572331b0dc828bd009a

[ Upstream commit bd1c959f37f384b477f51572331b0dc828bd009a ]

Add missing "avdd-0v9-supply" and "avdd-1v8-supply" properties to the "hdmi"
node in the Pine64 RockPro64 board dtsi file.  To achieve this, also add the
associated "vcca_0v9" regulator that produces the 0.9 V supply, [1][2] which
hasn't been defined previously in the board dtsi file.

This also eliminates the following warnings from the kernel log:

  dwhdmi-rockchip ff940000.hdmi: supply avdd-0v9 not found, using dummy regulator
  dwhdmi-rockchip ff940000.hdmi: supply avdd-1v8 not found, using dummy regulator

There are no functional changes to the way board works with these additions,
because the "vcc1v8_dvp" and "vcca_0v9" regulators are always enabled, [1][2]
but these additions improve the accuracy of hardware description.

These changes apply to the both supported hardware revisions of the Pine64
RockPro64, i.e. to the production-run revisions 2.0 and 2.1. [1][2]

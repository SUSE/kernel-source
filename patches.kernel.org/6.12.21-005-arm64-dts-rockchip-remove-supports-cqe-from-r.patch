Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: remove supports-cqe from rk3588 tiger
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.21
Git-commit: 3e0711f89e5e7b0c7b2ab4843dc92dcbbdbba777

[ Upstream commit 3e0711f89e5e7b0c7b2ab4843dc92dcbbdbba777 ]

The sdhci controller supports cqe it seems and necessary code also is in
place - in theory.

At this point Jaguar and Tiger are the only boards enabling cqe support
on the rk3588 and we are seeing reliability issues under load.

This can be caused by either a controller-, hw- or driver-issue and
definitly needs more investigation to work properly it seems.

So disable cqe support on Tiger for now.

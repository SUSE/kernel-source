Subject: [PATCH] arm64: properly install vmlinuz.efi
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.76
Git-commit: 7b21ed7d119dc06b0ed2ba3e406a02cafe3a8d03

commit 7b21ed7d119dc06b0ed2ba3e406a02cafe3a8d03 upstream.

If you select CONFIG_EFI_ZBOOT, we will generate vmlinuz.efi, and then
when we go to install the kernel we'll install the vmlinux instead
because install.sh only recognizes Image.gz as wanting the compressed
install image.  With CONFIG_EFI_ZBOOT we don't get the proper kernel
installed, which means it doesn't boot, which makes for a very confused
and subsequently angry kernel developer.

Fix this by properly installing our compressed kernel if we've enabled
CONFIG_EFI_ZBOOT.

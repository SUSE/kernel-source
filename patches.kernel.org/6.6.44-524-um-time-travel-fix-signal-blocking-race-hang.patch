Subject: [PATCH] um: time-travel: fix signal blocking race/hang
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.44

[ Upstream commit 2cf3a3c4b84def5406b830452b1cb8bbfffe0ebe ]

When signals are hard-blocked in order to do time-travel
socket processing, we set signals_blocked and then handle
SIGIO signals by setting the SIGIO bit in signals_pending.
When unblocking, we first set signals_blocked to 0, and
then handle all pending signals. We have to set it first,
so that we can again properly block/unblock inside the
unblock, if the time-travel handlers need to be processed.

Unfortunately, this is racy. We can get into this situation:

// signals_pending = SIGIO_MASK

unblock_signals_hard()
   signals_blocked = 0;
   if (signals_pending && signals_enabled) {
     block_signals();
     unblock_signals()
       ...
       sig_handler_common(SIGIO, NULL, NULL);
         sigio_handler()
           ...
           sigio_reg_handler()
             irq_do_timetravel_handler()
               reg->timetravel_handler() ==
               vu_req_interrupt_comm_handler()
                 vu_req_read_message()
                   vhost_user_recv_req()
                     vhost_user_recv()
                       vhost_user_recv_header()
                         // reads 12 bytes header of
                         // 20 bytes message
<-- receive SIGIO here <--
sig_handler()
   int enabled = signals_enabled; // 1
   if ((signals_blocked || !enabled) && (sig == SIGIO)) {
     if (!signals_blocked && time_travel_mode == TT_MODE_EXTERNAL)
       sigio_run_timetravel_handlers()
         _sigio_handler()
           sigio_reg_handler()
             ... as above ...
               vhost_user_recv_header()
                 // reads 8 bytes that were message payload
                 // as if it were header - but aborts since
                 // it then gets -EAGAIN
...
--> end signal handler -->
                       // continue in vhost_user_recv()
                       // full_read() for 8 bytes payload busy loops
                       // entire process hangs here

Conceptually, to fix this, we need to ensure that the
signal handler cannot run while we hard-unblock signals.
The thing that makes this more complex is that we can be
doing hard-block/unblock while unblocking. Introduce a
new signals_blocked_pending variable that we can keep at
non-zero as long as pending signals are being processed,
then we only need to ensure it's decremented safely and
the signal handler will only increment it if it's already
non-zero (or signals_blocked is set, of course.)

Note also that only the outermost call to hard-unblock is
allowed to decrement signals_blocked_pending, since it
could otherwise reach zero in an inner call, and leave
the same race happening if the timetravel_handler loops,
but that's basically required of it.

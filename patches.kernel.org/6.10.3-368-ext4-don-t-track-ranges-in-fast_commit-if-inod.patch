Subject: [PATCH] ext4: don't track ranges in fast_commit if inode has inlined
 data
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 7882b0187bbeb647967a7b5998ce4ad26ef68a9a

[ Upstream commit 7882b0187bbeb647967a7b5998ce4ad26ef68a9a ]

When fast-commit needs to track ranges, it has to handle inodes that have
inlined data in a different way because ext4_fc_write_inode_data(), in the
actual commit path, will attempt to map the required blocks for the range.
However, inodes that have inlined data will have it's data stored in
inode->i_block and, eventually, in the extended attribute space.

Unfortunately, because fast commit doesn't currently support extended
attributes, the solution is to mark this commit as ineligible.

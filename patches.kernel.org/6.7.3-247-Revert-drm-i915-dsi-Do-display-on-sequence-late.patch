commit 6992eb815d087858f8d7e4020529c2fe800456b3 upstream.

This reverts commit 88b065943cb583e890324d618e8d4b23460d51a3.

Lenovo 82TQ is unhappy if we do the display on sequence this
late. The display output shows severe corruption.

It's unclear if this is a failure on our part (perhaps
something to do with sending commands in LP mode after HS
/video mode transmission has been started? Though the backlight
on command at least seems to work) or simply that there are
some commands in the sequence that are needed to be done
earlier (eg. could be some DSC init stuff?). If the latter
then I don't think the current Windows code would work
either, but maybe this was originally tested with an older
driver, who knows.

Root causing this fully would likely require a lot of
experimentation which isn't really feasible without direct
access to the machine, so let's just accept failure and
go back to the original sequence.

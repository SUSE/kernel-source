Subject: [PATCH] Revert "drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error status to
 children on unhold"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.1
Git-commit: ac653dd7996edf1770959e11a078312928bd7315

commit ac653dd7996edf1770959e11a078312928bd7315 upstream.

Propagating errors to dependent fences is broken and can lead to errors
from one client ending up in another. In commit 3761baae908a ("Revert
"drm/i915: Propagate errors on awaiting already signaled fences""), we
attempted to get rid of fence error propagation but missed the case
added in commit 8e9f84cf5cac ("drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error
status to children on unhold"). Revert that one too. This error was
found by an up-and-coming selftest which triggers a reset during
request cancellation and verifies that subsequent requests complete
successfully.

v2:
 (Daniel Vetter)
  - Use revert
v3:
 (Jason)
  - Update commit message

v4 (Daniele):
 - fix checkpatch error in commit message.

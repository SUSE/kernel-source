Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: do not abort transaction on failure to update log root
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.8
Git-commit: 09e44868f1e03c7825ca4283256abedc95e249a3

commit 09e44868f1e03c7825ca4283256abedc95e249a3 upstream.

When syncing a log, if we fail to update a log root in the log root tree,
we are aborting the transaction if the failure was not -ENOSPC. This is
excessive because there is a chance that a transaction commit can succeed,
and therefore avoid to turn the filesystem into RO mode. All we need to be
careful about is to mark the log for a full commit, which we already do,
to make sure no one commits a super block pointing to an outdated log root
tree.

So don't abort the transaction if we fail to update a log root in the log
root tree, and log an error if the failure is not -ENOSPC, so that it does
not go completely unnoticed.

Subject: [PATCH] i2c: acpi: fix resource leak in reconfiguration device
 addition
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.12
Git-commit: 6558b646ce1c2a872fe1c2c7cb116f05a2c1950f

[ Upstream commit 6558b646ce1c2a872fe1c2c7cb116f05a2c1950f ]

acpi_i2c_find_adapter_by_handle() calls bus_find_device() which takes a
reference on the adapter which is never released which will result in a
reference count leak and render the adapter unremovable.  Make sure to
put the adapter after creating the client in the same manner that we do
for OF.

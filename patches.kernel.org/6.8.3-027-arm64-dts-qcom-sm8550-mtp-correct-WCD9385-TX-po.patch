Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8550-mtp: correct WCD9385 TX port mapping
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: b66966b1bbc0aa58f7af83cbd56d5a206892857c

[ Upstream commit b66966b1bbc0aa58f7af83cbd56d5a206892857c ]

WCD9385 audio codec TX port mapping was copied form HDK8450, but in fact
it is offset by one.  Correct it to fix recording via analogue
microphones.

The change is based on QRD8550 and should be correct here as well, but
was not tested on MTP8550.

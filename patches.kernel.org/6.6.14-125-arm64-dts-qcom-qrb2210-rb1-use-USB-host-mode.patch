Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: qrb2210-rb1: use USB host mode
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.14
Git-commit: e0cee8dc6757f9f18718eec553be9fffa503e103

[ Upstream commit e0cee8dc6757f9f18718eec553be9fffa503e103 ]

The default for the QCM2290 platform that this board is based on is OTG
mode, however the role detection logic is not hooked up for this board
and the dwc3 driver is configured to not allow role switching from
userspace.

Force this board to host mode as this is the preferred usecase until we
get role switching hooked up.

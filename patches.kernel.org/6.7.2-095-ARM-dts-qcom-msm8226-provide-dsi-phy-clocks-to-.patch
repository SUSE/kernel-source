Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: msm8226: provide dsi phy clocks to mmcc
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 836d083524888069cd358776a4e6c4ceec04962e

[ Upstream commit 836d083524888069cd358776a4e6c4ceec04962e ]

Some mmcc clocks have dsi0pll & dsi0pllbyte as clock parents so we
should provide them in the dt, which I missed in the commit adding the
mdss nodes.

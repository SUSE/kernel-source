Subject: [PATCH] nvme-tcp: send only permitted commands for secure concat
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.3
Git-commit: df4666a4908a6d883f628f93a3e6c80981332035

[ Upstream commit df4666a4908a6d883f628f93a3e6c80981332035 ]

In addition to sending permitted commands such as connect/auth
over the initial unencrypted admin connection as part of secure
channel concatenation, the host also sends commands such as
Property Get and Identify on the same. This is a spec violation
leading to secure concat failures. Fix this by ensuring these
additional commands are avoided on this connection.

[ Upstream commit 37882314d3bdc2ae775ebb9fa8ed7a94cd1aad61 ]

____cacheline_aligned is an insufficient guarantee for non-coherent DMA
on platforms with 128 byte cachelines above L1.  Switch to the updated
IIO_DMA_MINALIGN definition.

Fixes tag is probably not where the issue was first introduced, but
is likely to be as far as anyone considers backporting this fix.

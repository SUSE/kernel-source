Subject: [PATCH] PM: sleep: Fix power.is_suspended cleanup for direct-complete
 devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: d46c4c839c20a599a0eb8d73708ce401f9c7d06d

[ Upstream commit d46c4c839c20a599a0eb8d73708ce401f9c7d06d ]

Commit 03f1444016b7 ("PM: sleep: Fix handling devices with direct_complete
set on errors") caused power.is_suspended to be set for devices with
power.direct_complete set, but it forgot to ensure the clearing of that
flag for them in device_resume(), so power.is_suspended is still set for
them during the next system suspend-resume cycle.

If that cycle is aborted in dpm_suspend(), the subsequent invocation of
dpm_resume() will trigger a device_resume() call for every device and
because power.is_suspended is set for the devices in question, they will
not be skipped by device_resume() as expected which causes scary error
messages to be logged (as appropriate).

To address this issue, move the clearing of power.is_suspended in
device_resume() immediately after the power.is_suspended check so it
will be always cleared for all devices processed by that function.

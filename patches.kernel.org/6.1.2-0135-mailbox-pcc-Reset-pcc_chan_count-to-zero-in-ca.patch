Subject: [PATCH] mailbox: pcc: Reset pcc_chan_count to zero in case of PCC
 probe failure
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 6d7d3c287410c0ad499e478e2338dc3d7e3392b1

[ Upstream commit 6d7d3c287410c0ad499e478e2338dc3d7e3392b1 ]

Currently, 'pcc_chan_count' is remains set to a non-zero value if PCC
subspaces are parsed successfully but something else fail later during
the initial PCC probing phase. This will result in pcc_mbox_request_channel
trying to access the resources that are not initialised or allocated and
may end up in a system crash.

Reset pcc_chan_count to 0 when the PCC probe fails in order to prevent
the possible issue as described above.

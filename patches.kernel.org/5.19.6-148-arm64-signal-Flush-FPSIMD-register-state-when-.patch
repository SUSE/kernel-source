Subject: [PATCH] arm64/signal: Flush FPSIMD register state when disabling
 streaming mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.6
Git-commit: ea64baacbc36a0d552aec0d87107182f40211131

commit ea64baacbc36a0d552aec0d87107182f40211131 upstream.

When handling a signal delivered to a context with streaming mode enabled
we will disable streaming mode for the signal handler, when doing so we
should also flush the saved FPSIMD register state like exiting streaming
mode in the hardware would do so that if that state is reloaded we get the
same behaviour. Without this we will reload whatever the last FPSIMD state
that was saved for the task was.

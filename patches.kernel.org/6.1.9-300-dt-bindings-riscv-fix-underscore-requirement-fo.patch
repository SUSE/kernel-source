Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: riscv: fix underscore requirement for
 multi-letter extensions
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.9
Git-commit: ec64efc4966edf19fa1bc398a26bddfbadc1605f

commit ec64efc4966edf19fa1bc398a26bddfbadc1605f upstream.

The RISC-V ISA Manual allows the first multi-letter extension to avoid
a leading underscore. Underscores are only required between multi-letter
extensions.

The dt-binding does not validate that a multi-letter extension is
canonically ordered, as that'd need an even worse regex than is here,
but it should not fail validation for valid ISA strings.

Allow the first multi-letter extension to appear immediately after
the single-letter extensions.

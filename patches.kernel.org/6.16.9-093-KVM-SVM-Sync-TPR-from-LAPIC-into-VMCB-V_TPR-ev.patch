Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Sync TPR from LAPIC into VMCB::V_TPR even if AVIC
 is active
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.9
Git-commit: d02e48830e3fce9701265f6c5a58d9bdaf906a76

commit d02e48830e3fce9701265f6c5a58d9bdaf906a76 upstream.

Commit 3bbf3565f48c ("svm: Do not intercept CR8 when enable AVIC")
inhibited pre-VMRUN sync of TPR from LAPIC into VMCB::V_TPR in
sync_lapic_to_cr8() when AVIC is active.

AVIC does automatically sync between these two fields, however it does
so only on explicit guest writes to one of these fields, not on a bare
VMRUN.

This meant that when AVIC is enabled host changes to TPR in the LAPIC
state might not get automatically copied into the V_TPR field of VMCB.

This is especially true when it is the userspace setting LAPIC state via
KVM_SET_LAPIC ioctl() since userspace does not have access to the guest
VMCB.

Practice shows that it is the V_TPR that is actually used by the AVIC to
decide whether to issue pending interrupts to the CPU (not TPR in TASKPRI),
so any leftover value in V_TPR will cause serious interrupt delivery issues
in the guest when AVIC is enabled.

Fix this issue by doing pre-VMRUN TPR sync from LAPIC into VMCB::V_TPR
even when AVIC is enabled.

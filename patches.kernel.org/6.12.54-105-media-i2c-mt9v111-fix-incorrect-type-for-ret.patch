Subject: [PATCH] media: i2c: mt9v111: fix incorrect type for ret
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.54
Git-commit: bacd713145443dce7764bb2967d30832a95e5ec8

commit bacd713145443dce7764bb2967d30832a95e5ec8 upstream.

Change "ret" from unsigned int to int type in mt9v111_calc_frame_rate()
to store negative error codes or zero returned by __mt9v111_hw_reset()
and other functions.

Storing the negative error codes in unsigned type, doesn't cause an issue
at runtime but it's ugly as pants.

No effect on runtime.

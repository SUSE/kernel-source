Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8180x: Fix cluster PSCI suspend param
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.3
Git-commit: 9c31a3f5abc9eeb6509d06041b1e5f12deb39c4d

[ Upstream commit 9c31a3f5abc9eeb6509d06041b1e5f12deb39c4d ]

The value was copypasted from 8150, but 8180 expects a different one.
Confirmed with both downstream device tree and Windows DSDT, not tested
on hardware (sorry, I don't have any).

Fix it.

Subject: [PATCH] fs/ntfs3: use non-movable memory for ntfs3 MFT buffer cache
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: d6d33f03baa43d763fe094ca926eeae7d3421d07

[ Upstream commit d6d33f03baa43d763fe094ca926eeae7d3421d07 ]

Since the buffer cache for ntfs3 metadata is not released until the file
system is unmounted, allocating from the movable zone may result in cma
allocation failures. This is due to the page still being used by ntfs3,
leading to migration failures.

To address this, this commit use sb_bread_umovable() instead of
sb_bread(). This change prevents allocation from the movable zone,
ensuring compatibility with scenarios where the buffer head is not
released until unmount. This patch is inspired by commit
a8ac900b8163("ext4: use non-movable memory for the ext4 superblock").

The issue is found when playing video files stored in NTFS on the
Android TV platform. During this process, the media parser reads the
video file, causing ntfs3 to allocate buffer cache from the CMA area.
Subsequently, the hardware decoder attempts to allocate memory from the
same CMA area. However, the page is still in use by ntfs3, resulting in
a migrate failure in alloc_contig_range().

The pinned page and allocating stacktrace reported by page owner shows
below:

page:ffffffff00b68880 refcount:3 mapcount:0 mapping:ffffff80046aa828

Patch-mainline: 6.0.3

[ Upstream commit 60c9213a1d9941a8b33db570796c3f9be8984974 ]

All 3 properties are required by sram.yaml. Fixes the dtbs_check warning:
sram@900000: '#address-cells' is a required property
sram@900000: '#size-cells' is a required property
sram@900000: 'ranges' is a required property

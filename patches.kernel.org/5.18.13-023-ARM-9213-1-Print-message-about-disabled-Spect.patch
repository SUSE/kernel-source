 only once
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.13
Git-commit: e4ced82deb5fb17222fb82e092c3f8311955b585

commit e4ced82deb5fb17222fb82e092c3f8311955b585 upstream.

Print the message about disabled Spectre workarounds only once. The
message is printed each time CPU goes out from idling state on NVIDIA
Tegra boards, causing storm in KMSG that makes system unusable.

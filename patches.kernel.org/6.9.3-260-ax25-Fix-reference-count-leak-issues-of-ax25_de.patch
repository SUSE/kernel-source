Subject: [PATCH] ax25: Fix reference count leak issues of ax25_dev
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: b505e0319852b08a3a716b64620168eab21f4ced

[ Upstream commit b505e0319852b08a3a716b64620168eab21f4ced ]

The ax25_addr_ax25dev() and ax25_dev_device_down() exist a reference
count leak issue of the object "ax25_dev".

Memory leak issue in ax25_addr_ax25dev():

The reference count of the object "ax25_dev" can be increased multiple
times in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). This will cause a memory leak.

Memory leak issues in ax25_dev_device_down():

The reference count of ax25_dev is set to 1 in ax25_dev_device_up() and
then increase the reference count when ax25_dev is added to ax25_dev_list.
As a result, the reference count of ax25_dev is 2. But when the device is
shutting down. The ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count once
or twice depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause
memory leak.

As for the issue of ax25_addr_ax25dev(), it is impossible for one pointer
to be on a list twice. So add a break in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). As for the
issue of ax25_dev_device_down(), increase the reference count of ax25_dev
once in ax25_dev_device_up() and decrease the reference count of ax25_dev
after it is removed from the ax25_dev_list.

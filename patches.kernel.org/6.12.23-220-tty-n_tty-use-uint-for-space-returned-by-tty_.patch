Subject: [PATCH] tty: n_tty: use uint for space returned by tty_write_room()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.23
Git-commit: d97aa066678bd1e2951ee93db9690835dfe57ab6

[ Upstream commit d97aa066678bd1e2951ee93db9690835dfe57ab6 ]

tty_write_room() returns an "unsigned int". So in case some insane
driver (like my tty test driver) returns (legitimate) UINT_MAX from its
tty_operations::write_room(), n_tty is confused on several places.

For example, in process_output_block(), the result of tty_write_room()
is stored into (signed) "int". So this UINT_MAX suddenly becomes -1. And
that is extended to ssize_t and returned from process_output_block().
This causes a write() to such a node to receive -EPERM (which is -1).

Fix that by using proper "unsigned int" and proper "== 0" test. And
return 0 constant directly in that "if", so that it is immediately clear
what is returned ("space" equals to 0 at that point).

Similarly for process_output() and __process_echoes().

Note this does not fix any in-tree driver as of now.

If you want "Fixes: something", it would be commit 03b3b1a2405c ("tty:
make tty_operations::write_room return uint"). I intentionally do not
mark this patch by a real tag below.

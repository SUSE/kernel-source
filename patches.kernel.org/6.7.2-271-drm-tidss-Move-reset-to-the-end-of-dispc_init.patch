Subject: [PATCH] drm/tidss: Move reset to the end of dispc_init()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 36d1e0852680aa038e2428d450673390111b165c

[ Upstream commit 36d1e0852680aa038e2428d450673390111b165c ]

We do a DSS reset in the middle of the dispc_init(). While that happens
to work now, we should really make sure that e..g the fclk, which is
acquired only later in the function, is enabled when doing a reset. This
will be handled in a later patch, but for now, let's move the
dispc_softreset() call to the end of dispc_init(), which is a sensible
place for it anyway.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Stop writing VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD
 at probe time
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.4
Git-commit: a10ba160d427e78ffa2ab15a86cacaec291fa58a

[ Upstream commit a10ba160d427e78ffa2ab15a86cacaec291fa58a ]

Commit d69cd7eea93e ("platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Disable touchpad_switch
for ELAN0634") from Janary 2021 added a flag hiding the touchpad sysfs-attr
and disabling ideapad_sync_touchpad_state() because some devices
"do not use EC to switch touchpad".

At the same time this added a write(VPCCMD_W_TOUCHPAD, 1) call at probe
time on these same devices. This seems to be copied from the rfkill code
which does something similar when hw rfkill support is disabled.

But for the rfkill code this is known to be necessary on some models,
where as for the touchpad control no motivation is given for doing this
and prior to this patch there were no reports of needing to do this.

So this seems unnecessary; and it is best to avoid poking the hardware
unnecessary to avoid unwanted side effects, so remove this.

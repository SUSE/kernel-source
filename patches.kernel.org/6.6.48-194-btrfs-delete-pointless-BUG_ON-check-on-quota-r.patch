Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: delete pointless BUG_ON check on quota root in
 btrfs_qgroup_account_extent()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.48
Git-commit: f40a3ea94881f668084f68f6b9931486b1606db0

[ Upstream commit f40a3ea94881f668084f68f6b9931486b1606db0 ]

The BUG_ON is deep in the qgroup code where we can expect that it
exists. A NULL pointer would cause a crash.

It was added long ago in 550d7a2ed5db35 ("btrfs: qgroup: Add new qgroup
calculation function btrfs_qgroup_account_extents()."). It maybe made
sense back then as the quota enable/disable state machine was not that
robust as it is nowadays, so we can just delete it.

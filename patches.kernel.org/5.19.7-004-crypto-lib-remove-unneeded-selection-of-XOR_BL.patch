Subject: [PATCH] crypto: lib - remove unneeded selection of XOR_BLOCKS
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.7
Git-commit: 874b301985ef2f89b8b592ad255e03fb6fbfe605

commit 874b301985ef2f89b8b592ad255e03fb6fbfe605 upstream.

CRYPTO_LIB_CHACHA_GENERIC doesn't need to select XOR_BLOCKS.  It perhaps
was thought that it's needed for __crypto_xor, but that's not the case.

Enabling XOR_BLOCKS is problematic because the XOR_BLOCKS code runs a
benchmark when it is initialized.  That causes a boot time regression on
systems that didn't have it enabled before.

Therefore, remove this unnecessary and problematic selection.

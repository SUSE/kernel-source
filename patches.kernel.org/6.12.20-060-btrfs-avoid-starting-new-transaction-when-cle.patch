Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: avoid starting new transaction when cleaning qgroup
 during subvolume drop
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.20
Git-commit: fdef89ce6fada462aef9cb90a140c93c8c209f0f

[ Upstream commit fdef89ce6fada462aef9cb90a140c93c8c209f0f ]

At btrfs_qgroup_cleanup_dropped_subvolume() all we want to commit the
current transaction in order to have all the qgroup rfer/excl numbers up
to date. However we are using btrfs_start_transaction(), which joins the
current transaction if there is one that is not yet committing, but also
starts a new one if there is none or if the current one is already
committing (its state is >= TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START). This later case
results in unnecessary IO, wasting time and a pointless rotation of the
backup roots in the super block.

So instead of using btrfs_start_transaction() followed by a
btrfs_commit_transaction(), use btrfs_commit_current_transaction() which
achieves our purpose and avoids starting and committing new transactions.

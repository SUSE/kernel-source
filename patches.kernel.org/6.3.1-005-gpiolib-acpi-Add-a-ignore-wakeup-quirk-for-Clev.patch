Subject: [PATCH] gpiolib: acpi: Add a ignore wakeup quirk for Clevo NL5xNU
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.1
Git-commit: 782eea0c89f7d071d6b56ecfa1b8b0c81164b9be

commit 782eea0c89f7d071d6b56ecfa1b8b0c81164b9be upstream.

commit 1796f808e4bb ("HID: i2c-hid: acpi: Stop setting wakeup_capable")
changed the policy such that I2C touchpads may be able to wake up the
system by default if the system is configured as such.

However on Clevo NL5xNU there is a mistake in the ACPI tables that the
TP_ATTN# signal connected to GPIO 9 is configured as ActiveLow and level
triggered but connected to a pull up. As soon as the system suspends the
touchpad loses power and then the system wakes up.

To avoid this problem, introduce a quirk for this model that will prevent
the wakeup capability for being set for GPIO 9.

This patch is analoge to a very similar patch for NL5xRU, just the DMI
string changed.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fallback to blocking mode when doing async dio over
 multiple extents
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.13
Git-commit: ca93e44bfb5fd7996b76f0f544999171f647f93b

commit ca93e44bfb5fd7996b76f0f544999171f647f93b upstream.

Some users recently reported that MariaDB was getting a read corruption
when using io_uring on top of btrfs. This started to happen in 5.16,
after commit 51bd9563b6783d ("btrfs: fix deadlock due to page faults
during direct IO reads and writes"). That changed btrfs to use the new
iomap flag IOMAP_DIO_PARTIAL and to disable page faults before calling
iomap_dio_rw(). This was necessary to fix deadlocks when the iovector
corresponds to a memory mapped file region. That type of scenario is
exercised by test case generic/647 from fstests.

For this MariaDB scenario, we attempt to read 16K from file offset X
using IOCB_NOWAIT and io_uring. In that range we have 4 extents, each
with a size of 4K, and what happens is the following:

1) btrfs_direct_read() disables page faults and calls iomap_dio_rw();

2) iomap creates a struct iomap_dio object, its reference count is
   initialized to 1 and its ->size field is initialized to 0;

3) iomap calls btrfs_dio_iomap_begin() with file offset X, which finds
   the first 4K extent, and setups an iomap for this extent consisting
   of a single page;

4) At iomap_dio_bio_iter(), we are able to access the first page of the
   buffer (struct iov_iter) with bio_iov_iter_get_pages() without
   triggering a page fault;

5) iomap submits a bio for this 4K extent
   (iomap_dio_submit_bio() -> btrfs_submit_direct()) and increments
   the refcount on the struct iomap_dio object to 2; The ->size field
   of the struct iomap_dio object is incremented to 4K;

6) iomap calls btrfs_iomap_begin() again, this time with a file
   offset of X + 4K. There we setup an iomap for the next extent
   that also has a size of 4K;

7) Then at iomap_dio_bio_iter() we call bio_iov_iter_get_pages(),
   which tries to access the next page (2nd page) of the buffer.
   This triggers a page fault and returns -EFAULT;

8) At __iomap_dio_rw() we see the -EFAULT, but we reset the error
   to 0 because we passed the flag IOMAP_DIO_PARTIAL to iomap and
   the struct iomap_dio object has a ->size value of 4K (we submitted
   a bio for an extent already). The 'wait_for_completion' variable
   is not set to true, because our iocb has IOCB_NOWAIT set;

9) At the bottom of __iomap_dio_rw(), we decrement the reference count
   of the struct iomap_dio object from 2 to 1. Because we were not
   the only ones holding a reference on it and 'wait_for_completion' is
   set to false, -EIOCBQUEUED is returned to btrfs_direct_read(), which
   just returns it up the callchain, up to io_uring;

10) The bio submitted for the first extent (step 5) completes and its
    bio endio function, iomap_dio_bio_end_io(), decrements the last
    reference on the struct iomap_dio object, resulting in calling
    iomap_dio_complete_work() -> iomap_dio_complete().

11) At iomap_dio_complete() we adjust the iocb->ki_pos from X to X + 4K
    and return 4K (the amount of io done) to iomap_dio_complete_work();

12) iomap_dio_complete_work() calls the iocb completion callback,
    iocb->ki_complete() with a second argument value of 4K (total io
    done) and the iocb with the adjust ki_pos of X + 4K. This results
    in completing the read request for io_uring, leaving it with a
    result of 4K bytes read, and only the first page of the buffer
    filled in, while the remaining 3 pages, corresponding to the other
    3 extents, were not filled;

13) For the application, the result is unexpected because if we ask
    to read N bytes, it expects to get N bytes read as long as those
    N bytes don't cross the EOF (i_size).

MariaDB reports this as an error, as it's not expecting a short read,
since it knows it's asking for read operations fully within the i_size
boundary. This is typical in many applications, but it may also be
questionable if they should react to such short reads by issuing more
read calls to get the remaining data. Nevertheless, the short read
happened due to a change in btrfs regarding how it deals with page
faults while in the middle of a read operation, and there's no reason
why btrfs can't have the previous behaviour of returning the whole data
that was requested by the application.

The problem can also be triggered with the following simple program:

       io_uring_cqe_seen(&ring, cqe);
       io_uring_queue_exit(&ring);

       return 0;
  }

When running it on an unpatched kernel:

  $ gcc io_uring_test.c -luring
  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sda
  $ mount /dev/sda /mnt/sda
  $ ./a.out /mnt/sda
  io_uring read result for file foo:

    cqe->res == 4096 (expected 8192)
    memcmp(read_buf, write_buf) == -205 (expected 0)

After this patch, the read always returns 8192 bytes, with the buffer
filled with the correct data. Although that reproducer always triggers
the bug in my test vms, it's possible that it will not be so reliable
on other environments, as that can happen if the bio for the first
extent completes and decrements the reference on the struct iomap_dio
object before we do the atomic_dec_and_test() on the reference at
__iomap_dio_rw().

Fix this in btrfs by having btrfs_dio_iomap_begin() return -EAGAIN
whenever we try to satisfy a non blocking IO request (IOMAP_NOWAIT flag
set) over a range that spans multiple extents (or a mix of extents and
holes). This avoids returning success to the caller when we only did
partial IO, which is not optimal for writes and for reads it's actually
incorrect, as the caller doesn't expect to get less bytes read than it has
requested (unless EOF is crossed), as previously mentioned. This is also
the type of behaviour that xfs follows (xfs_direct_write_iomap_begin()),
even though it doesn't use IOMAP_DIO_PARTIAL.

A test case for fstests will follow soon.

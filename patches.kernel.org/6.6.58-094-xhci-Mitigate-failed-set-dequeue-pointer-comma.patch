Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Mitigate failed set dequeue pointer commands
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.58
Git-commit: fe49df60cdb7c2975aa743dc295f8786e4b7db10

commit fe49df60cdb7c2975aa743dc295f8786e4b7db10 upstream.

Avoid xHC host from processing a cancelled URB by always turning
cancelled URB TDs into no-op TRBs before queuing a 'Set TR Deq' command.

If the command fails then xHC will start processing the cancelled TD
instead of skipping it once endpoint is restarted, causing issues like
Babble error.

This is not a complete solution as a failed 'Set TR Deq' command does not
guarantee xHC TRB caches are cleared.

Fixes: 4db356924a50 ("xhci: turn cancelled td cleanup to its own function")

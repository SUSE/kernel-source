Subject: [PATCH] mm: page_alloc: control latency caused by zone PCP draining
References: bsc#1218260

[ Upstream commit 55f77df7d715110299f12c27f4365bd6332d1adb ]

Patch series "mm/treewide: Remove pXd_huge() API", v2.

In previous work [1], we removed the pXd_large() API, which is arch
specific.  This patchset further removes the hugetlb pXd_huge() API.

Hugetlb was never special on creating huge mappings when compared with
other huge mappings.  Having a standalone API just to detect such pgtable
entries is more or less redundant, especially after the pXd_leaf() API set
is introduced with/without CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE.

When looking at this problem, a few issues are also exposed that we don't
have a clear definition of the *_huge() variance API.  This patchset
started by cleaning these issues first, then replace all *_huge() users to
use *_leaf(), then drop all *_huge() code.

On x86/sparc, swap entries will be reported "true" in pXd_huge(), while
for all the rest archs they're reported "false" instead.  This part is
done in patch 1-5, in which I suspect patch 1 can be seen as a bug fix,
but I'll leave that to hmm experts to decide.

Besides, there are three archs (arm, arm64, powerpc) that have slightly
different definitions between the *_huge() v.s.  *_leaf() variances.  I
tackled them separately so that it'll be easier for arch experts to chim
in when necessary.  This part is done in patch 6-9.

The final patches 10-14 do the rest on the final removal, since *_leaf()
will be the ultimate API in the future, and we seem to have quite some
confusions on how *_huge() APIs can be defined, provide a rich comment for
*_leaf() API set to define them properly to avoid future misuse, and
hopefully that'll also help new archs to start support huge mappings and
avoid traps (like either swap entries, or PROT_NONE entry checks).

This patch (of 14):

When the complete PCP is drained a much larger number of pages than the
usual batch size might be freed at once, causing large IRQ and preemption
latency spikes, as they are all freed while holding the pcp and zone
spinlocks.

To avoid those latency spikes, limit the number of pages freed in a single
bulk operation to common batch limits.

Subject: [PATCH] spi: tegra114: Don't fail set_cs_timing when delays are zero
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.28
Git-commit: 4426e6b4ecf632bb75d973051e1179b8bfac2320

commit 4426e6b4ecf632bb75d973051e1179b8bfac2320 upstream.

The original code would skip null delay pointers, but when the pointers
were converted to point within the spi_device struct, the check was not
updated to skip delays of zero. Hence all spi devices that didn't set
delays would fail to probe.

Subject: [PATCH] blk-wbt: Fix detection of dirty-throttled tasks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.6
Git-commit: f814bdda774c183b0cc15ec8f3b6e7c6f4527ba5

commit f814bdda774c183b0cc15ec8f3b6e7c6f4527ba5 upstream.

The detection of dirty-throttled tasks in blk-wbt has been subtly broken
since its beginning in 2016. Namely if we are doing cgroup writeback and
the throttled task is not in the root cgroup, balance_dirty_pages() will
set dirty_sleep for the non-root bdi_writeback structure. However
blk-wbt checks dirty_sleep only in the root cgroup bdi_writeback
structure. Thus detection of recently throttled tasks is not working in
this case (we noticed this when we switched to cgroup v2 and suddently
writeback was slow).

Since blk-wbt has no easy way to get to proper bdi_writeback and
furthermore its intention has always been to work on the whole device
rather than on individual cgroups, just move the dirty_sleep timestamp
from bdi_writeback to backing_dev_info. That fixes the checking for
recently throttled task and saves memory for everybody as a bonus.

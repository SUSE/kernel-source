Subject: [PATCH] cifs: when extending a file with falloc we should make files
 not-sparse
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: f66f8b94e7f2f4ac9fffe710be231ca8f25c5057

commit f66f8b94e7f2f4ac9fffe710be231ca8f25c5057 upstream.

as this is the only way to make sure the region is allocated.
Fix the conditional that was wrong and only tried to make already
non-sparse files non-sparse.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Set correct domains values at
 _i915_vma_move_to_active
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.11
Git-commit: 08b812985996924c0ccf79d54a31fc9757c0a6ca

commit 08b812985996924c0ccf79d54a31fc9757c0a6ca upstream.

Fix regression introduced by commit:
"drm/i915: Individualize fences before adding to dma_resv obj"
which sets obj->read_domains to 0 for both read and write paths.
Also set obj->write_domain to 0 on read path which was removed by
the commit.

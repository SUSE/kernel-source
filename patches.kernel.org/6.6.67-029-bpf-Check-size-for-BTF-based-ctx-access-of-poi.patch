Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Check size for BTF-based ctx access of pointer members
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.67
Git-commit: 659b9ba7cb2d7adb64618b87ddfaa528a143766e

commit 659b9ba7cb2d7adb64618b87ddfaa528a143766e upstream.

Robert Morris reported the following program type which passes the
verifier in [0]:

SEC("struct_ops/bpf_cubic_init")
void BPF_PROG(bpf_cubic_init, struct sock *sk)
{
	asm volatile("r2 = *(u16*)(r1 + 0)");     // verifier should demand u64
	asm volatile("*(u32 *)(r2 +1504) = 0");   // 1280 in some configs
}

The second line may or may not work, but the first instruction shouldn't
pass, as it's a narrow load into the context structure of the struct ops
callback. The code falls back to btf_ctx_access to ensure correctness
and obtaining the types of pointers. Ensure that the size of the access
is correctly checked to be 8 bytes, otherwise the verifier thinks the
narrow load obtained a trusted BTF pointer and will permit loads/stores
as it sees fit.

Perform the check on size after we've verified that the load is for a
pointer field, as for scalar values narrow loads are fine. Access to
structs passed as arguments to a BPF program are also treated as
scalars, therefore no adjustment is needed in their case.

Existing verifier selftests are broken by this change, but because they
were incorrect. Verifier tests for d_path were performing narrow load
into context to obtain path pointer, had this program actually run it
would cause a crash. The same holds for verifier_btf_ctx_access tests.

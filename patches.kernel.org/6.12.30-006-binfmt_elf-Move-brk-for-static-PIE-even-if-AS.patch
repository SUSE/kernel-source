Subject: [PATCH] binfmt_elf: Move brk for static PIE even if ASLR disabled
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.30
Git-commit: 11854fe263eb1b9a8efa33b0c087add7719ea9b4

[ Upstream commit 11854fe263eb1b9a8efa33b0c087add7719ea9b4 ]

In commit bbdc6076d2e5 ("binfmt_elf: move brk out of mmap when doing
direct loader exec"), the brk was moved out of the mmap region when
loading static PIE binaries (ET_DYN without INTERP). The common case
for these binaries was testing new ELF loaders, so the brk needed to
be away from mmap to avoid colliding with stack, future mmaps (of the
loader-loaded binary), etc. But this was only done when ASLR was enabled,
in an attempt to minimize changes to memory layouts.

After adding support to respect alignment requirements for static PIE
binaries in commit 3545deff0ec7 ("binfmt_elf: Honor PT_LOAD alignment
for static PIE"), it became possible to have a large gap after the
final PT_LOAD segment and the top of the mmap region. This means that
future mmap allocations might go after the last PT_LOAD segment (where
brk might be if ASLR was disabled) instead of before them (where they
traditionally ended up).

On arm64, running with ASLR disabled, Ubuntu 22.04's "ldconfig" binary,
a static PIE, has alignment requirements that leaves a gap large enough
after the last PT_LOAD segment to fit the vdso and vvar, but still leave
enough space for the brk (which immediately follows the last PT_LOAD
segment) to be allocated by the binary.

fffff7f20000-fffff7fde000 r-xp 00000000 fe:02 8110426 /sbin/ldconfig.real
fffff7fee000-fffff7ff5000 rw-p 000be000 fe:02 8110426 /sbin/ldconfig.real
fffff7ff5000-fffff7ffa000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
***[brk will go here at fffff7ffa000]***

fffffffdf000-1000000000000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0      [stack]

After commit 0b3bc3354eb9 ("arm64: vdso: Switch to generic storage
implementation"), the arm64 vvar grew slightly, and suddenly the brk
collided with the allocation.

fffff7f20000-fffff7fde000 r-xp 00000000 fe:02 8110426 /sbin/ldconfig.real
fffff7fee000-fffff7ff5000 rw-p 000be000 fe:02 8110426 /sbin/ldconfig.real
fffff7ff5000-fffff7ffa000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
***[oops, no room any more, vvar is at fffff7ffa000!]***
fffff7ffa000-fffff7ffe000 r--p 00000000 00:00 0       [vvar]
fffff7ffe000-fffff8000000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0       [vdso]
fffffffdf000-1000000000000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0      [stack]

The solution is to unconditionally move the brk out of the mmap region
for static PIE binaries. Whether ASLR is enabled or not does not change if
there may be future mmap allocation collisions with a growing brk region.

Update memory layout comments (with kernel-doc headings), consolidate
the setting of mm->brk to later (it isn't needed early), move static PIE
brk out of mmap unconditionally, and make sure brk(2) knows to base brk
position off of mm->start_brk not mm->end_data no matter what the cause of
moving it is (via current->brk_randomized).

For the CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK case, though, leave the logic unchanged, as we
can never safely move the brk. These systems, however, are not using
specially aligned static PIE binaries.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: regulator for sd needs to be always on
 for BPI-R2Pro
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.9
Git-commit: 433d54818f64a2fe0562f8c04c7a81f562368515

[ Upstream commit 433d54818f64a2fe0562f8c04c7a81f562368515 ]

With default dts configuration for BPI-R2Pro, the regulator for sd card is
powered off when reboot is commanded, and the only solution to detect the
sd card again, and therefore, allow rebooting from there, is to do a
hardware reset.

Configure the regulator for sd to be always on for BPI-R2Pro in order to
avoid this issue.

Subject: [PATCH] fbdev: ssd1307fb: Drop optional dependency
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 025e3b507a3a8e1ee96a3112bb67495c77d6cdb6

[ Upstream commit 025e3b507a3a8e1ee96a3112bb67495c77d6cdb6 ]

Only a single out of three devices need a PWM, so from driver it's
optional. Moreover it's a single driver in the entire kernel that
currently selects PWM. Unfortunately this selection is a root cause
of the circular dependencies when we want to enable optional PWM
for some other drivers that select GPIOLIB.

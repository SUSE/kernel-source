Subject: [PATCH] xfs: remove unused fields from struct xbtree_ifakeroot
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.24
Git-commit: 4c8ecd1cfdd01fb727121035014d9f654a30bdf2

commit 4c8ecd1cfdd01fb727121035014d9f654a30bdf2 upstream.

Remove these unused fields since nobody uses them.  They should have
been removed years ago in a different cleanup series from Christoph
Hellwig.

Fixes: daf83964a3681 ("xfs: move the per-fork nextents fields into struct xfs_ifork")
Fixes: f7e67b20ecbbc ("xfs: move the fork format fields into struct xfs_ifork")

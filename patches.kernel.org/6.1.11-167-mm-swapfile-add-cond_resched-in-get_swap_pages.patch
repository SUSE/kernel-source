Subject: [PATCH] mm/swapfile: add cond_resched() in get_swap_pages()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.11
Git-commit: 7717fc1a12f88701573f9ed897cc4f6699c661e3

commit 7717fc1a12f88701573f9ed897cc4f6699c661e3 upstream.

The softlockup still occurs in get_swap_pages() under memory pressure.  64
CPU cores, 64GB memory, and 28 zram devices, the disksize of each zram
device is 50MB with same priority as si.  Use the stress-ng tool to
increase memory pressure, causing the system to oom frequently.

The plist_for_each_entry_safe() loops in get_swap_pages() could reach tens
of thousands of times to find available space (extreme case:
cond_resched() is not called in scan_swap_map_slots()).  Let's add
cond_resched() into get_swap_pages() when failed to find available space
to avoid softlockup.

Subject: [PATCH] net: hibmcge: fix wrong mtu log issue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.4
Git-commit: 4e4ac53335de54bcb9d26842df0998cfd8fcaf90

[ Upstream commit 4e4ac53335de54bcb9d26842df0998cfd8fcaf90 ]

A dbg log is generated when the driver modifies the MTU,
which is expected to trace the change of the MTU.

However, the log is recorded after WRITE_ONCE().
At this time, netdev->mtu has been changed to the new value.
As a result, netdev->mtu is the same as new_mtu.

This patch modifies the log location and records logs before WRITE_ONCE().

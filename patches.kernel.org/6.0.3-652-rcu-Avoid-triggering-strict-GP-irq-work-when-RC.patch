Subject: [PATCH] rcu: Avoid triggering strict-GP irq-work when RCU is idle
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 621189a1fe93cb2b34d62c5cdb9e258bca044813

[ Upstream commit 621189a1fe93cb2b34d62c5cdb9e258bca044813 ]

Kernels built with PREEMPT_RCU=y and RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y trigger
irq-work from rcu_read_unlock(), and the resulting irq-work handler
invokes rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handle().  The point of this triggering
is to force grace periods to end quickly in order to give tools like KASAN
a better chance of detecting RCU usage bugs such as leaking RCU-protected
pointers out of an RCU read-side critical section.

However, this irq-work triggering is unconditional.  This works, but
there is no point in doing this irq-work unless the current grace period
is waiting on the running CPU or task, which is not the common case.
After all, in the common case there are many rcu_read_unlock() calls
per CPU per grace period.

This commit therefore triggers the irq-work only when the current grace
period is waiting on the running CPU or task.

This change was tested as follows on a four-CPU system:

	echo rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
	echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/function_profile_enabled
	insmod rcutorture.ko
	sleep 20
	rmmod rcutorture.ko
	echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/function_profile_enabled
	echo > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter

This procedure produces results in this per-CPU set of files:

	/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_stat/function*

Sample output from one of these files is as follows:

  Function                               Hit    Time            Avg             s^2
  --------                               ---    ----            ---             ---
  rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handle      838746    182650.3 us     0.217 us        0.004 us

The baseline sum of the "Hit" values (the number of calls to this
function) was 3,319,015.  With this commit, that sum was 1,140,359,
for a 2.9x reduction.  The worst-case variance across the CPUs was less
than 25%, so this large effect size is statistically significant.

Subject: [PATCH] team: Fix initial vlan_feature set in __team_compute_features
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.6
Git-commit: 396699ac2cb1bc4e3485abb48a1e3e41956de0cd

[ Upstream commit 396699ac2cb1bc4e3485abb48a1e3e41956de0cd ]

Similarly as with bonding, fix the calculation of vlan_features to reuse
netdev_base_features() in order derive the set in the same way as
ndo_fix_features before iterating through the slave devices to refine the
feature set.

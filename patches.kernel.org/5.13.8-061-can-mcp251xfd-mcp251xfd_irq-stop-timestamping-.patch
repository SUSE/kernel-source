Subject: [PATCH] can: mcp251xfd: mcp251xfd_irq(): stop timestamping worker in
 case error in IRQ
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.8
Git-commit: ef68a717960658e6a1e5f08adb0574326e9a12c2

[ Upstream commit ef68a717960658e6a1e5f08adb0574326e9a12c2 ]

In case an error occurred in the IRQ handler, the chip status is
dumped via devcoredump and all IRQs are disabled, but the chip stays
powered for further analysis.

The chip is in an undefined state and will not receive any CAN frames,
so shut down the timestamping worker, which reads the TBC register
regularly, too. This avoids any CRC read error messages if there is a
communication problem with the chip.

Fixes: efd8d98dfb90 ("can: mcp251xfd: add HW timestamp infrastructure")

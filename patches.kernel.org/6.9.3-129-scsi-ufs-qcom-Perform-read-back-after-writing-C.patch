Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ufs: qcom: Perform read back after writing CGC enable
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: d9488511b3ac7eb48a91bc5eded7027525525e03

[ Upstream commit d9488511b3ac7eb48a91bc5eded7027525525e03 ]

Currently, the CGC enable bit is written and then an mb() is used to ensure
that completes before continuing.

mb() ensures that the write completes, but completion doesn't mean that it
isn't stored in a buffer somewhere. The recommendation for ensuring this
bit has taken effect on the device is to perform a read back to force it to
make it all the way to the device. This is documented in device-io.rst and
a talk by Will Deacon on this can be seen over here:

Let's do that to ensure the bit hits the device. Because the mb()'s purpose
wasn't to add extra ordering (on top of the ordering guaranteed by
writel()/readl()), it can safely be removed.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests: watchdog: skip ping loop if WDIOF_KEEPALIVEPING
 not supported
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.53
Git-commit: e8cfc524eaf3c0ed88106177edb6961e202e6716

[ Upstream commit e8cfc524eaf3c0ed88106177edb6961e202e6716 ]

Check if watchdog device supports WDIOF_KEEPALIVEPING option before
entering keep_alive() ping test loop. Fix watchdog-test silently looping
if ioctl based ping is not supported by the device. Exit from test in
such case instead of getting stuck in loop executing failing keep_alive()

watchdog_info:
 identity:              m41t93 rtc Watchdog
 firmware_version:      0
Support/Status: Set timeout (in seconds)
Support/Status: Watchdog triggers a management or other external alarm not a reboot

Watchdog card disabled.
Watchdog timeout set to 5 seconds.
Watchdog ping rate set to 2 seconds.
Watchdog card enabled.
WDIOC_KEEPALIVE not supported by this device

without this change
Watchdog card disabled.
Watchdog timeout set to 5 seconds.
Watchdog ping rate set to 2 seconds.
Watchdog card enabled.
Watchdog Ticking Away!
(Where test stuck here forver silently)

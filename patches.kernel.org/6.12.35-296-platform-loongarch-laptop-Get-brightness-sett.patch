Subject: [PATCH] platform/loongarch: laptop: Get brightness setting from EC on
 probe
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.35
Git-commit: 1205088fd0393bd9eae96b62bf1e4b9eb1b73edf

commit 1205088fd0393bd9eae96b62bf1e4b9eb1b73edf upstream.

Previously during driver probe, 1 is unconditionally taken as current
brightness value and set to props.brightness, which will be considered
as the brightness before suspend and restored to EC on resume. Since a
brightness value of 1 almost never matches EC's state on coldboot (my
laptop's EC defaults to 80), this causes surprising changes of screen
brightness on the first time of resume after coldboot.

Let's get brightness from EC and take it as the current brightness on
probe of the laptop driver to avoid the surprising behavior. Tested on
TongFang L860-T2 Loongson-3A5000 laptop.

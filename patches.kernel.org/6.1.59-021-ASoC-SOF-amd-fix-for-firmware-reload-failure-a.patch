Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: amd: fix for firmware reload failure after
 playback
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.59
Git-commit: 7e1fe5d9e7eae67e218f878195d1d348d01f9af7

commit 7e1fe5d9e7eae67e218f878195d1d348d01f9af7 upstream.

Setting ACP ACLK as clock source when ACP enters D0 state causing
firmware load failure as mentioned in below scenario.

- Load snd_sof_amd_rembrandt
- Play or Record audio
- Stop audio
- Unload snd_sof_amd_rembrandt
- Reload snd_sof_amd_rembrandt

If acp_clkmux_sel register field is set, then clock source will be
set to ACP ACLK when ACP enters D0 state.

During stream stop, if there is no active stream is running then
acp firmware will set the ACP ACLK value to zero.

When driver is reloaded and clock source is selected as ACP ACLK,
as ACP ACLK is programmed to zero, firmware loading will fail.

For RMB platform, remove the clock mux selection field so that
ACP will use internal clock source when ACP enters D0 state.

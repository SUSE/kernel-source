Subject: [PATCH] eventfs: Fix bitwise fields for "is_events"
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.18
Git-commit: fd56cd5f6d76e93356d9520cf9dabffe1e3d1aa0

commit fd56cd5f6d76e93356d9520cf9dabffe1e3d1aa0 upstream.

A flag was needed to denote which eventfs_inode was the "events"
directory, so a bit was taken from the "nr_entries" field, as there's not
that many entries, and 2^30 is plenty. But the bit number for nr_entries
was not updated to reflect the bit taken from it, which would add an
unnecessary integer to the structure.

Subject: [PATCH] tcp: fix rate_app_limited to default to 1
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.9
Git-commit: 300b655db1b5152d6101bcb6801d50899b20c2d6

[ Upstream commit 300b655db1b5152d6101bcb6801d50899b20c2d6 ]

The initial default value of 0 for tp->rate_app_limited was incorrect,
since a flow is indeed application-limited until it first sends
data. Fixing the default to be 1 is generally correct but also
specifically will help user-space applications avoid using the initial
tcpi_delivery_rate value of 0 that persists until the connection has
some non-zero bandwidth sample.

Fixes: eb8329e0a04d ("tcp: export data delivery rate")

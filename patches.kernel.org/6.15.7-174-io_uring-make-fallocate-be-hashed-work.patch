Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: make fallocate be hashed work
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.7
Git-commit: 88a80066af1617fab444776135d840467414beb6

[ Upstream commit 88a80066af1617fab444776135d840467414beb6 ]

Like ftruncate and write, fallocate operations on the same file cannot
be executed in parallel, so it is better to make fallocate be hashed
work.

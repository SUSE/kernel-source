Subject: [PATCH] mips: dmi: Fix early remap on MIPS32
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: 0d0a3748a2cb38f9da1f08d357688ebd982eb788

[ Upstream commit 0d0a3748a2cb38f9da1f08d357688ebd982eb788 ]

dmi_early_remap() has been defined as ioremap_cache() which on MIPS32 gets
to be converted to the VM-based mapping. DMI early remapping is performed
at the setup_arch() stage with no VM available. So calling the
dmi_early_remap() for MIPS32 causes the system to crash at the early boot
time. Fix that by converting dmi_early_remap() to the uncached remapping
which is always available on both 32 and 64-bits MIPS systems.

Note this change shall not cause any regressions on the current DMI
support implementation because on the early boot-up stage neither MIPS32
nor MIPS64 has the cacheable ioremapping support anyway.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: toshiba_haps: Fix memory leaks in add/remove
 routines
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.70
Git-commit: 128497456756e1b952bd5a912cd073836465109d

[ Upstream commit 128497456756e1b952bd5a912cd073836465109d ]

toshiba_haps_add() leaks the haps object allocated by it if it returns
an error after allocating that object successfully.

toshiba_haps_remove() does not free the object pointed to by
toshiba_haps before clearing that pointer, so it becomes unreachable
allocated memory.

Address these memory leaks by using devm_kzalloc() for allocating
the memory in question.

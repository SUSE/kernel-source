Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: pre-allocate pgtable pages for uffd wr-protects
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.8
Git-commit: fed15f1345dc8a7fc8baa81e8b55c3ba010d7f4b

commit fed15f1345dc8a7fc8baa81e8b55c3ba010d7f4b upstream.

Userfaultfd-wp uses pte markers to mark wr-protected pages for both shmem
and hugetlb.  Shmem has pre-allocation ready for markers, but hugetlb path
was overlooked.

Doing so by calling huge_pte_alloc() if the initial pgtable walk fails to
find the huge ptep.  It's possible that huge_pte_alloc() can fail with
high memory pressure, in that case stop the loop immediately and fail
silently.  This is not the most ideal solution but it matches with what we
do with shmem meanwhile it avoids the splat in dmesg.

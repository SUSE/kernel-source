Subject: [PATCH] selftests: Fix raw socket bind tests with VRF
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.11
Git-commit: 0f108ae4452025fef529671998f6c7f1c4526790

[ Upstream commit 0f108ae4452025fef529671998f6c7f1c4526790 ]

Commit referenced below added negative socket bind tests for VRF. The
socket binds should fail since the address to bind to is in a VRF yet
the socket is not bound to the VRF or a device within it. Update the
expected return code to check for 1 (bind failure) so the test passes
when the bind fails as expected. Add a 'show_hint' comment to explain
why the bind is expected to fail.

Fixes: 75b2b2b3db4c ("selftests: Add ipv4 address bind tests to fcnal-test")

Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: fix folio is still mapped when deleted
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.50
Git-commit: 7b7387650dcf2881fd8bb55bcf3c8bd6c9542dd7

commit 7b7387650dcf2881fd8bb55bcf3c8bd6c9542dd7 upstream.

Migration may be raced with fallocating hole.  remove_inode_single_folio
will unmap the folio if the folio is still mapped.  However, it's called
without folio lock.  If the folio is migrated and the mapped pte has been
converted to migration entry, folio_mapped() returns false, and won't
unmap it.  Due to extra refcount held by remove_inode_single_folio,
migration fails, restores migration entry to normal pte, and the folio is
mapped again.  As a result, we triggered BUG in filemap_unaccount_folio.

The log is as follows:

Hold folio lock before checking if the folio is mapped to avold race with
migration.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2711: Don't mark timer regs unconfigured
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.21
Git-commit: c24f272ae751a9f54f8816430e7f2d56031892cc

[ Upstream commit c24f272ae751a9f54f8816430e7f2d56031892cc ]

During upstream process of Raspberry Pi 4 back in 2019 the ARMv7 stubs
didn't configured the ARM architectural timer. This firmware issue has
been fixed in 2020, which gave users enough time to update their system.

So drop this property to allow the use of the vDSO version of
clock_gettime.

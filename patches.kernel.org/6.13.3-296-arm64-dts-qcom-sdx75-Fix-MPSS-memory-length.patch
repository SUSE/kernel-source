Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdx75: Fix MPSS memory length
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: 9a27f0e1869e992e4107e2af8ec348e1a3b9d4d5

commit 9a27f0e1869e992e4107e2af8ec348e1a3b9d4d5 upstream.

The address space in MPSS/Modem PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)
remoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space
(QDSP6...SS_PUB) which has a length of 0x10000.  Value of 0x4040 was
copied from older DTS, but it grew since then.

This should have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader
does not use this address space at all.

Subject: [PATCH] spi: spi-geni-qcom: Correct CS_TOGGLE bit in SPI_TRANS_CFG
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 5fd7c99ecf45c8ee8a9b1268f0ffc91cc6271da2

[ Upstream commit 5fd7c99ecf45c8ee8a9b1268f0ffc91cc6271da2 ]

The CS_TOGGLE bit when set is supposed to instruct FW to
toggle CS line between words. The driver with intent of
disabling this behaviour has been unsetting BIT(0). This has
not caused any trouble so far because the original BIT(1)
is untouched and BIT(0) likely wasn't being used.

Correct this to prevent a potential future bug.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

[ Upstream commit d5aede3e6dd1b8ca574600a1ecafe1e580c53f2f ]

1. Reorder interrupts
2. Fix typo: s/spi_lr_overhead/spi_lr_overread/
3. Rename node: s/spi-nor@0/flash@0/

This fixes:
arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm4709-buffalo-wxr-1900dhp.dt.yaml: spi@18029200: interrupt-names: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
        ['spi_lr_fullness_reached', 'spi_lr_session_aborted', 'spi_lr_impatient', 'spi_lr_session_done', 'spi_lr_overhead', 'mspi_done', 'mspi_halted'] is too long
        Additional items are not allowed ('spi_lr_session_aborted', 'spi_lr_impatient', 'spi_lr_session_done', 'spi_lr_overhead', 'mspi_done', 'mspi_halted' were unexpected)
        'mspi_done' was expected
        'spi_l1_intr' was expected
        'mspi_halted' was expected
        'spi_lr_fullness_reached' was expected
        'spi_lr_session_aborted' was expected
        'spi_lr_impatient' was expected
        'spi_lr_session_done' was expected
        'spi_lr_overread' was expected
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/brcm,spi-bcm-qspi.yaml
arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm4709-buffalo-wxr-1900dhp.dt.yaml: spi-nor@0: $nodename:0: 'spi-nor@0' does not match '^flash(@.*)?$'
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/jedec,spi-nor.yaml

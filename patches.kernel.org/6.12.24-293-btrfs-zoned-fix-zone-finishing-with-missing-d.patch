Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: zoned: fix zone finishing with missing devices
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.24
Git-commit: 35fec1089ebb5617f85884d3fa6a699ce6337a75

commit 35fec1089ebb5617f85884d3fa6a699ce6337a75 upstream.

If do_zone_finish() is called with a filesystem that has missing devices
(e.g. a RAID file system mounted in degraded mode) it is accessing the
btrfs_device::zone_info pointer, which will not be set if the device
in question is missing.

Check if the device is present (by checking if it has a valid block device
pointer associated) and if not, skip zone finishing for it.

Fixes: 4dcbb8ab31c1 ("btrfs: zoned: make zone finishing multi stripe capable")

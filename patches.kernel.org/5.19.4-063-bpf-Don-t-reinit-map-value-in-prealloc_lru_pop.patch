Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Don't reinit map value in prealloc_lru_pop
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: 275c30bcee66a27d1aa97a215d607ad6d49804cb

commit 275c30bcee66a27d1aa97a215d607ad6d49804cb upstream.

The LRU map that is preallocated may have its elements reused while
another program holds a pointer to it from bpf_map_lookup_elem. Hence,
only check_and_free_fields is appropriate when the element is being
deleted, as it ensures proper synchronization against concurrent access
of the map value. After that, we cannot call check_and_init_map_value
again as it may rewrite bpf_spin_lock, bpf_timer, and kptr fields while
they can be concurrently accessed from a BPF program.

This is safe to do as when the map entry is deleted, concurrent access
is protected against by check_and_free_fields, i.e. an existing timer
would be freed, and any existing kptr will be released by it. The
program can create further timers and kptrs after check_and_free_fields,
but they will eventually be released once the preallocated items are
freed on map destruction, even if the item is never reused again. Hence,
the deleted item sitting in the free list can still have resources
attached to it, and they would never leak.

With spin_lock, we never touch the field at all on delete or update, as
we may end up modifying the state of the lock. Since the verifier
ensures that a bpf_spin_lock call is always paired with bpf_spin_unlock
call, the program will eventually release the lock so that on reuse the
new user of the value can take the lock.

Essentially, for the preallocated case, we must assume that the map
value may always be in use by the program, even when it is sitting in
the freelist, and handle things accordingly, i.e. use proper
synchronization inside check_and_free_fields, and never reinitialize the
special fields when it is reused on update.

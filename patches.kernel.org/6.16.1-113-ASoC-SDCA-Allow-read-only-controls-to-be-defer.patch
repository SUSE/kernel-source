Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SDCA: Allow read-only controls to be deferrable
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: 4eb6ad5d2080681b531db2c1764246f9a868062f

[ Upstream commit 4eb6ad5d2080681b531db2c1764246f9a868062f ]

The current SDCA Control parsing only checks the deferrable flag for
Read/Write and Dual Ranked controls. However, reads can defer as well as
writes so Read Only controls should also check for the deferrable flag.
Add the handling for this into find_sdca_entity_control().

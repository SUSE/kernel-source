Subject: [PATCH] bcache: add code comments for bch_btree_node_get() and
 __bch_btree_node_alloc()
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.69
Git-commit: 31f5b956a197d4ec25c8a07cb3a2ab69d0c0b82f

[ Upstream commit 31f5b956a197d4ec25c8a07cb3a2ab69d0c0b82f ]

This patch adds code comments to bch_btree_node_get() and
__bch_btree_node_alloc() that NULL pointer will not be returned and it
is unnecessary to check NULL pointer by the callers of these routines.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Don't WARN if userspace mucks with RCX during
 string I/O exit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.8
Git-commit: d07898eaf39909806128caccb6ebd922ee3edd69

commit d07898eaf39909806128caccb6ebd922ee3edd69 upstream.

Replace a WARN with a comment to call out that userspace can modify RCX
during an exit to userspace to handle string I/O.  KVM doesn't actually
support changing the rep count during an exit, i.e. the scenario can be
ignored, but the WARN needs to go as it's trivial to trigger from
userspace.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/vmwgfx: Don't memcmp equivalent pointers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.6
Git-commit: 5703fc058efdafcdd6b70776ee562478f0753acb

[ Upstream commit 5703fc058efdafcdd6b70776ee562478f0753acb ]

These pointers are frequently the same and memcmp does not compare the
pointers before comparing their contents so this was wasting cycles
comparing 16 KiB of memory which will always be equal.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Flush RSC sleep & wake votes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 91e83140b5dd5598fbcfada3ee1f8b2b410c3731

[ Upstream commit 91e83140b5dd5598fbcfada3ee1f8b2b410c3731 ]

The rpmh driver will cache sleep and wake votes until the cluster
power-domain is about to enter idle, to avoid unnecessary writes. So
associate the apps_rsc with the cluster pd, so that it can be notified
about this event.

Without this, only AMC votes are being commited.

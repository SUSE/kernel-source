Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: core: Check for rtd == NULL in
 snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.43
Git-commit: 2d91cb261cac6d885954b8f5da28b5c176c18131

[ Upstream commit 2d91cb261cac6d885954b8f5da28b5c176c18131 ]

snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime() might be called with rtd == NULL which will
leads to null pointer dereference.
This was reproduced with topology loading and marking a link as ignore
due to missing hardware component on the system.
On module removal the soc_tplg_remove_link() would call
snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime() with rtd == NULL since the link was ignored,
no runtime was created.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: decrease BW in simult flows
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.22
Git-commit: 5e2f3c65af47e527ccac54060cf909e3306652ff

[ Upstream commit 5e2f3c65af47e527ccac54060cf909e3306652ff ]

When running the simult_flow selftest in slow environments -- e.g. QEmu
without KVM support --, the results can be unstable. This selftest
checks if the aggregated bandwidth is (almost) fully used as expected.

To help improving the stability while still keeping the same validation
in place, the BW and the delay are reduced to lower the pressure on the
CPU.

Fixes: 1a418cb8e888 ("mptcp: simult flow self-tests")
Fixes: 219d04992b68 ("mptcp: push pending frames when subflow has free space")

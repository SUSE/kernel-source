[ Upstream commit 7aefd8b53815274f3ef398d370a3c9b27dd9f00c ]

Gcc-12 correctly warned about this code using a non-NULL pointer as a
truth value:

  drivers/gpu/drm/imx/ipuv3-crtc.c: In function ‘ipu_crtc_disable_planes’:
  drivers/gpu/drm/imx/ipuv3-crtc.c:72:21: error: the comparison will always evaluate as ‘true’ for the address of ‘plane’ will never be NULL [-Werror=address]
     72 |                 if (&ipu_crtc->plane[1] && plane == &ipu_crtc->plane[1]->base)
        |                     ^

due to the extraneous '&' address-of operator.

Philipp Zabel points out that The mistake had no adverse effect since
the following condition doesn't actually dereference the NULL pointer,
but the intent of the code was obviously to check for it, not to take
the address of the member.

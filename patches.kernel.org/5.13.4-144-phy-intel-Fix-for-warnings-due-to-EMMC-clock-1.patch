Subject: [PATCH] phy: intel: Fix for warnings due to EMMC clock 175Mhz change
 in FIP
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: 2f2b73a29d2aabf5ad0150856c3e5cb6e04dcfc1

[ Upstream commit 2f2b73a29d2aabf5ad0150856c3e5cb6e04dcfc1 ]

Since the EMMC clock was changed from 200Mhz to 175Mhz in FIP,
there were some warnings introduced, as the frequency values
being checked was still wrt 200Mhz in code. Hence, the frequency
checks are now updated based on the current 175Mhz EMMC clock changed
in FIP.

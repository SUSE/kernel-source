Subject: [PATCH] xfrm: Allow transport-mode states with AF_UNSPEC selector
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.8
Git-commit: c276a706ea1f51cf9723ed8484feceaf961b8f89

[ Upstream commit c276a706ea1f51cf9723ed8484feceaf961b8f89 ]

xfrm state selectors are matched against the inner-most flow
which can be of any address family.  Therefore middle states
in nested configurations need to carry a wildcard selector in
order to work at all.

However, this is currently forbidden for transport-mode states.

Fix this by removing the unnecessary check.

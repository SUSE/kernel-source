[ Upstream commit c49ae619905eebd3f54598a84e4cd2bd58ba8fe9 ]

Jan reported that on Turris Omnia (Armada 385), no PCIe devices were
detected after upgrading from v5.16.1 to v5.16.3 and identified the cause
as the backport of 91a8d79fc797 ("PCI: mvebu: Fix configuring secondary bus
of PCIe Root Port via emulated bridge"), which appeared in v5.17-rc1.

91a8d79fc797 was incorrectly applied from mailing list patch [1] to the
linux git repository [2] probably due to resolving merge conflicts
incorrectly. Fix it now.

Subject: [PATCH] nilfs2: prevent kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: 269cdf353b5bdd15f1a079671b0f889113865f20

[ Upstream commit 269cdf353b5bdd15f1a079671b0f889113865f20 ]

Fix a bug where nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status when
searching and inserting the specified block both fail inconsistently.  If
this inconsistent behavior is not due to a previously fixed bug, then an
unexpected race is occurring, so return a temporary error -EAGAIN instead.

This prevents callers such as __block_write_begin_int() from requesting a
read into a buffer that is not mapped, which would cause the BUG_ON check
for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc() to fail.

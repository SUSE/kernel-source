[ Upstream commit 96a3295c351da82d7af99b2fc004a3cf9f4716a9 ]

Warning on every translated mtd partition results in excessive log noise
if this driver is loaded:

  nand: device found, Manufacturer ID: 0xc2, Chip ID: 0xf1
  nand: Macronix MX30LF1G18AC
  nand: 128 MiB, SLC, erase size: 128 KiB, page size: 2048, OOB size: 64
  mt7621-nand 1e003000.nand: ECC strength adjusted to 4 bits
  read_bbt: found bbt at block 1023
  10 fixed-partitions partitions found on MTD device mt7621-nand

This is more likely to annoy than to help users of embedded distros where
this driver is enabled by default.  Making the blockdevs available does
not imply that they are in use, and warning about bootloader partitions
or other devices which obviously never will be mounted is more confusing
than helpful.

Move the warning to open(), where it will be of more use - actually warning
anyone who mounts a file system on NAND using mtdblock.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: nxp-ptn3460: fix i2c_master_send() error checking
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.3
Git-commit: 914437992876838662c968cb416f832110fb1093

commit 914437992876838662c968cb416f832110fb1093 upstream.

The i2c_master_send/recv() functions return negative error codes or the
number of bytes that were able to be sent/received.  This code has
two problems.  1)  Instead of checking if all the bytes were sent or
received, it checks that at least one byte was sent or received.
2) If there was a partial send/receive then we should return a negative
error code but this code returns success.

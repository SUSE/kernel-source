Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8180x: Shrink aoss_qmp register space
 size
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: dcad0590d1ea4278a55c30dd2903611a96111601

[ Upstream commit dcad0590d1ea4278a55c30dd2903611a96111601 ]

The AOSS_QMP region is overallocated, bleeding into space that's supposed
to be used by other peripherals. Fix it.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests/net: l2_tos_ttl_inherit.sh: Ensure environment
 cleanup on failure.
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.7
Git-commit: d68ff8ad3351b8fc8d6f14b9a4f5cc8ba3e8bd13

[ Upstream commit d68ff8ad3351b8fc8d6f14b9a4f5cc8ba3e8bd13 ]

Use 'set -e' and an exit handler to stop the script if a command fails
and ensure the test environment is cleaned up in any case. Also, handle
the case where the script is interrupted by SIGINT.

The only command that's expected to fail is 'wait $ping_pid', since
it's killed by the script. Handle this case with '|| true' to make it
play well with 'set -e'.

Finally, return the Kselftest SKIP code (4) when the script breaks
because of an environment problem or a command line failure. The 0 and
1 return codes should now reliably indicate that all tests have been
run (0: all tests run and passed, 1: all tests run but at least one
failed, 4: test script didn't run completely).

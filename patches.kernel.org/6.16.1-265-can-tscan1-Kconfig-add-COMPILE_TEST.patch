Subject: [PATCH] can: tscan1: Kconfig: add COMPILE_TEST
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: 5323af351e7524497930b7793153ff68ee5c0ec1

[ Upstream commit 5323af351e7524497930b7793153ff68ee5c0ec1 ]

tscan1 depends on ISA. It also has a hidden dependency on HAS_IOPORT
as reported by the kernel test bot [1]. That dependency is implied by
ISA which explains why this was not an issue so far.

Add both COMPILE_TEST and HAS_IOPORT to the dependency list so that
this driver can also be built on other platforms.

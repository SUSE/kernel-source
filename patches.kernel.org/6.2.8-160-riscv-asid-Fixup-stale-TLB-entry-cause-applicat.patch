Subject: [PATCH] riscv: asid: Fixup stale TLB entry cause application crash
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.8
Git-commit: 82dd33fde0268cc622d3d1ac64971f3f61634142

commit 82dd33fde0268cc622d3d1ac64971f3f61634142 upstream.

After use_asid_allocator is enabled, the userspace application will
crash by stale TLB entries. Because only using cpumask_clear_cpu without
local_flush_tlb_all couldn't guarantee CPU's TLB entries were fresh.
Then set_mm_asid would cause the user space application to get a stale
value by stale TLB entry, but set_mm_noasid is okay.

Here is the symptom of the bug:
unhandled signal 11 code 0x1 (coredump)
   0x0000003fd6d22524 <+4>:     auipc   s0,0x70
   0x0000003fd6d22528 <+8>:     ld      s0,-148(s0) # 0x3fd6d92490
=> 0x0000003fd6d2252c <+12>:    ld      a5,0(s0)
(gdb) i r s0
s0          0x8082ed1cc3198b21       0x8082ed1cc3198b21
(gdb) x /2x 0x3fd6d92490
0x3fd6d92490:   0xd80ac8a8      0x0000003f
The core dump file shows that register s0 is wrong, but the value in
memory is correct. Because 'ld s0, -148(s0)' used a stale mapping entry
in TLB and got a wrong result from an incorrect physical address.

When the task ran on CPU0, which loaded/speculative-loaded the value of
address(0x3fd6d92490), then the first version of the mapping entry was
PTWed into CPU0's TLB.
When the task switched from CPU0 to CPU1 (No local_tlb_flush_all here by
asid), it happened to write a value on the address (0x3fd6d92490). It
caused do_page_fault -> wp_page_copy -> ptep_clear_flush ->
ptep_get_and_clear & flush_tlb_page.
The flush_tlb_page used mm_cpumask(mm) to determine which CPUs need TLB
flush, but CPU0 had cleared the CPU0's mm_cpumask in the previous
switch_mm. So we only flushed the CPU1 TLB and set the second version
mapping of the PTE. When the task switched from CPU1 to CPU0 again, CPU0
still used a stale TLB mapping entry which contained a wrong target
physical address. It raised a bug when the task happened to read that
value.

   CPU0                               CPU1
   - switch 'task' in
   - read addr (Fill stale mapping
     entry into TLB)
   - switch 'task' out (no tlb_flush)
                                      - switch 'task' in (no tlb_flush)
                                      - write addr cause pagefault
                                        do_page_fault() (change to
                                        new addr mapping)
                                          wp_page_copy()
                                            ptep_clear_flush()
                                              ptep_get_and_clear()
                                              & flush_tlb_page()
                                        write new value into addr
                                      - switch 'task' out (no tlb_flush)
   - switch 'task' in (no tlb_flush)
   - read addr again (Use stale
     mapping entry in TLB)
     get wrong value from old phyical
     addr, BUG!

The solution is to keep all CPUs' footmarks of cpumask(mm) in switch_mm,
which could guarantee to invalidate all stale TLB entries during TLB
flush.

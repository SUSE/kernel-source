Subject: [PATCH] regulator: core: move supply check earlier in

[ Upstream commit 86a8eeb0e913f4b6a55dabba5122098d4e805e55 ]

Since commit 98e48cd9283d ("regulator: core: resolve supply for
boot-on/always-on regulators"), set_machine_constraints() can return
-EPROBE_DEFER very late, after it has done a lot of work and
configuration of the regulator.

This means that configuration will happen multiple times for no
benefit in that case. Furthermore, this can lead to timing-dependent
voltage glitches as mentioned e.g. in commit 8a866d527ac0 ("regulator:
core: Resolve supply name earlier to prevent double-init").

We can know that it's going to fail very early, in particular before
going through the complete regulator configuration by moving some code
around a little.

Do so to avoid re-configuring the regulator multiple times, also
avoiding the voltage glitches if we can.

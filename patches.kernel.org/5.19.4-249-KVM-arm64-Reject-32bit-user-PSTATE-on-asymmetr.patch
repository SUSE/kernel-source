Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Reject 32bit user PSTATE on asymmetric systems
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: b10d86fb8e46cc812171728bcd326df2f34e9ed5

[ Upstream commit b10d86fb8e46cc812171728bcd326df2f34e9ed5 ]

KVM does not support AArch32 EL0 on asymmetric systems. To that end,
prevent userspace from configuring a vCPU in such a state through
setting PSTATE.

It is already ABI that KVM rejects such a write on a system where
AArch32 EL0 is unsupported. Though the kernel's definition of a 32bit
system changed in commit 2122a833316f ("arm64: Allow mismatched
32-bit EL0 support"), KVM's did not.

Fixes: 2122a833316f ("arm64: Allow mismatched 32-bit EL0 support")

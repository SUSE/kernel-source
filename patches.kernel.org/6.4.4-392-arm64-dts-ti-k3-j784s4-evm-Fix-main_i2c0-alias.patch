Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-j784s4-evm: Fix main_i2c0 alias
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.4
Git-commit: c10a9df30e3401bd5a5ee43f1afd6c2b2ca75ad7

[ Upstream commit c10a9df30e3401bd5a5ee43f1afd6c2b2ca75ad7 ]

main_i2c0 is aliased as i2c0 which creates a problem for u-boot R5
SPL attempting to reuse the same definition in the common board
detection logic as it looks for the first i2c instance as the bus on
which to detect the eeprom to understand the board variant involved.
Switch main_i2c0 to i2c3 alias allowing us to introduce wkup_i2c0
and potentially space for mcu_i2c instances in the gap for follow on
patches.

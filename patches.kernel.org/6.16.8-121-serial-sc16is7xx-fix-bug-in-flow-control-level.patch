Subject: [PATCH] serial: sc16is7xx: fix bug in flow control levels init
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.8
Git-commit: 535fd4c98452c87537a40610abba45daf5761ec6

commit 535fd4c98452c87537a40610abba45daf5761ec6 upstream.

When trying to set MCR[2], XON1 is incorrectly accessed instead. And when
writing to the TCR register to configure flow control levels, we are
incorrectly writing to the MSR register. The default value of $00 is then
used for TCR, which means that selectable trigger levels in FCR are used
in place of TCR.

TCR/TLR access requires EFR[4] (enable enhanced functions) and MCR[2]
to be set. EFR[4] is already set in probe().

MCR access requires LCR[7] to be zero.

Since LCR is set to $BF when trying to set MCR[2], XON1 is incorrectly
accessed instead because MCR shares the same address space as XON1.

Since MCR[2] is unmodified and still zero, when writing to TCR we are in
fact writing to MSR because TCR/TLR registers share the same address space
as MSR/SPR.

Fix by first removing useless reconfiguration of EFR[4] (enable enhanced
functions), as it is already enabled in sc16is7xx_probe() since commit
43c51bb573aa ("sc16is7xx: make sure device is in suspend once probed").
Now LCR is $00, which means that MCR access is enabled.

Also remove regcache_cache_bypass() calls since we no longer access the
enhanced registers set, and TCR is already declared as volatile (in fact
by declaring MSR as volatile, which shares the same address).

Finally disable access to TCR/TLR registers after modifying them by
clearing MCR[2].

Note: the comment about "... and internal clock div" is wrong and can be
      ignored/removed as access to internal clock div registers (DLL/DLH)
      is permitted only when LCR[7] is logic 1, not when enhanced features
      is enabled. And DLL/DLH access is not needed in sc16is7xx_startup().

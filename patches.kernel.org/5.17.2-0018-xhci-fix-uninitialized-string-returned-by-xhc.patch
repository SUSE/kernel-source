Subject: [PATCH] xhci: fix uninitialized string returned by
 xhci_decode_ctrl_ctx()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: 05519b8589a679edb8fa781259893d20bece04ad

commit 05519b8589a679edb8fa781259893d20bece04ad upstream.

xhci_decode_ctrl_ctx() returns the untouched buffer as-is if both "drop"
and "add" parameters are zero.

Fix the function to return an empty string in that case.

It was not immediately clear from the possible call chains whether this
issue is currently actually triggerable or not.

Note that before commit 4843b4b5ec64 ("xhci: fix even more unsafe memory
usage in xhci tracing") the result effect in the failure case was different
as a static buffer was used here, but the code still worked incorrectly.

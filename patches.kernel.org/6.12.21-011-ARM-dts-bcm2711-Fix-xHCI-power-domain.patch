Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2711: Fix xHCI power-domain
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.21
Git-commit: f44fa354a0715577ca32b085f6f60bcf32c748dd

[ Upstream commit f44fa354a0715577ca32b085f6f60bcf32c748dd ]

During s2idle tests on the Raspberry CM4 the VPU firmware always crashes
on xHCI power-domain resume:

root@raspberrypi:/sys/power# echo freeze > state
[   70.724347] xhci_suspend finished
[   70.727730] xhci_plat_suspend finished
[   70.755624] bcm2835-power bcm2835-power: Power grafx off
[   70.761127]  USB: Set power to 0

[   74.653040]  USB: Failed to set power to 1 (-110)

This seems to be caused because of the mixed usage of
raspberrypi-power and bcm2835-power at the same time. So avoid
the usage of the VPU firmware power-domain driver, which
prevents the VPU crash.

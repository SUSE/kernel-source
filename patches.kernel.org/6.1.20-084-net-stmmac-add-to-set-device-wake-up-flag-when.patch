Subject: [PATCH] net: stmmac: add to set device wake up flag when stmmac init
 phy
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.20
Git-commit: a9334b702a03b693f54ebd3b98f67bf722b74870

[ Upstream commit a9334b702a03b693f54ebd3b98f67bf722b74870 ]

When MAC is not support PMT, driver will check PHY's WoL capability
and set device wakeup capability in stmmac_init_phy(). We can enable
the WoL through ethtool, the driver would enable the device wake up
flag. Now the device_may_wakeup() return true.

But if there is a way which enable the PHY's WoL capability derectly,
like in BIOS. The driver would not know the enable thing and would not
set the device wake up flag. The phy_suspend may failed like this:

[   32.409063] PM: dpm_run_callback(): mdio_bus_phy_suspend+0x0/0x50 returns -16
[   32.409065] PM: Device stmmac-1:00 failed to suspend: error -16
[   32.409067] PM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected

Add to set the device wakeup enable flag according to the get_wol
function result in PHY can fix the error in this scene.

v2: add a Fixes tag.

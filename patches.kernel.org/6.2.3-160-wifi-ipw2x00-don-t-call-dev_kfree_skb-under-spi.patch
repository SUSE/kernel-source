Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ipw2x00: don't call dev_kfree_skb() under
 spin_lock_irqsave()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.3
Git-commit: 45fc6d7461f18df2f238caf0cbc5acc4163203d1

[ Upstream commit 45fc6d7461f18df2f238caf0cbc5acc4163203d1 ]

It is not allowed to call kfree_skb() or consume_skb() from hardware
interrupt context or with hardware interrupts being disabled.

It should use dev_kfree_skb_irq() or dev_consume_skb_irq() instead.
The difference between them is free reason, dev_kfree_skb_irq() means
the SKB is dropped in error and dev_consume_skb_irq() means the SKB
is consumed in normal.

In this case, dev_kfree_skb() is called to free and drop the SKB when
it's reset, so replace it with dev_kfree_skb_irq(). Compile tested
only.

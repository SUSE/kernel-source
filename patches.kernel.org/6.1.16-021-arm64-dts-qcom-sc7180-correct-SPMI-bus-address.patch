Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: correct SPMI bus address cells
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 1f75745537222172f84783d369bbd1fb2d4b6414

[ Upstream commit 1f75745537222172f84783d369bbd1fb2d4b6414 ]

The SPMI bus uses two address cells and zero size cells (second reg
entry - SPMI_USID - is not the size):

  spmi@c440000: #address-cells:0:0: 2 was expected

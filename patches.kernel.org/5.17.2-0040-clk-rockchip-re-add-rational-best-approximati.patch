Subject: [PATCH] clk: rockchip: re-add rational best approximation algorithm
 to the fractional divider
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: 10b74af310735860510a533433b1d3ab2e05a138

commit 10b74af310735860510a533433b1d3ab2e05a138 upstream.

In commit 4e7cf74fa3b2 ("clk: fractional-divider: Export approximation
algorithm to the CCF users"), the code handling the rational best
approximation algorithm was replaced by a call to the core
clk_fractional_divider_general_approximation function which did the same
thing back then.

However, in commit 82f53f9ee577 ("clk: fractional-divider: Introduce
POWER_OF_TWO_PS flag"), this common code was made conditional on
CLK_FRAC_DIVIDER_POWER_OF_TWO_PS flag which was not added back to the
rockchip clock driver.

This broke the ltk050h3146w-a2 MIPI DSI display present on a PX30-based
downstream board.

Let's add the flag to the fractional divider flags so that the original
and intended behavior is brought back to the rockchip clock drivers.

Subject: [PATCH] PCI/PM: Avoid D3cold for HP Pavilion 17 PC/1972 PCIe Ports
References: bsc#1218260

[ Upstream commit 256df20c590bf0e4d63ac69330cf23faddac3e08 ]

Hewlett-Packard HP Pavilion 17 Notebook PC/1972 is an Intel Ivy Bridge
system with a muxless AMD Radeon dGPU.  Attempting to use the dGPU fails
with the following sequence:

  ACPI Error: Aborting method \AMD3._ON due to previous error (AE_AML_LOOP_TIMEOUT) (20230628/psparse-529)
  radeon 0000:01:00.0: not ready 1023ms after resume; waiting
  radeon 0000:01:00.0: not ready 2047ms after resume; waiting
  radeon 0000:01:00.0: not ready 4095ms after resume; waiting
  radeon 0000:01:00.0: not ready 8191ms after resume; waiting
  radeon 0000:01:00.0: not ready 16383ms after resume; waiting
  radeon 0000:01:00.0: not ready 32767ms after resume; waiting
  radeon 0000:01:00.0: not ready 65535ms after resume; giving up
  radeon 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3cold to D0, device inaccessible

The issue is that the Root Port the dGPU is connected to can't handle the
transition from D3cold to D0 so the dGPU can't properly exit runtime PM.

The existing logic in pci_bridge_d3_possible() checks for systems that are
newer than 2015 to decide that D3 is safe.  This would nominally work for
an Ivy Bridge system (which was discontinued in 2015), but this system
appears to have continued to receive BIOS updates until 2017 and so this
existing logic doesn't appropriately capture it.

Add the system to bridge_d3_blacklist to prevent D3cold from being used.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: mac80211: update radar_required in channel context
 after channel switch
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: 140c6a61d83cbd85adba769b5ef8d61acfa5b392

[ Upstream commit 140c6a61d83cbd85adba769b5ef8d61acfa5b392 ]

Currently, when a non-DFS channel is brought up and the bandwidth is
expanded from 80 MHz to 160 MHz, where the primary 80 MHz is non-DFS
and the secondary 80 MHz consists of DFS channels, radar detection
fails if radar occurs in the secondary 80 MHz.

When the channel is switched from 80 MHz to 160 MHz, with the primary
80 MHz being non-DFS and the secondary 80 MHz consisting of DFS
channels, the radar required flag in the channel switch parameters
is set to true. However, when using a reserved channel context,
it is not updated in sdata, which disables radar detection in the
secondary 80 MHz DFS channels.

Update the radar required flag in sdata to fix this issue when using
a reserved channel context.

Subject: [PATCH] NFS: Fix data corruption caused by congestion.
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.21
Git-commit: be8a177250b2ba387a55ce37dd4a8046a0ccab55

when AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE is returned (as NFS does when it detects
congestion) it is important that the folio is redirtied.
nfs_writepage_locked() doesn't do this, so files can become corrupted as
writes can be lost.

Note that this is not needed in v6.8 as AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE cannot be
returned.  It is needed for kernels v5.18..v6.7.  Prior to 6.3 the patch
is different as it needs to mention "page", not "folio".

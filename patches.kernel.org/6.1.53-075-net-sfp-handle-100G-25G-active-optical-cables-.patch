Subject: [PATCH] net: sfp: handle 100G/25G active optical cables in
 sfp_parse_support
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: db1a6ad77c180efc7242d7204b9a0c72c8a5a1bb

[ Upstream commit db1a6ad77c180efc7242d7204b9a0c72c8a5a1bb ]

Handle extended compliance code 0x1 (SFF8024_ECC_100G_25GAUI_C2M_AOC)
for active optical cables supporting 25G and 100G speeds.

Since the specification makes no statement about transmitter range, and
as the specific sfp module that had been tested features only 2m fiber -
short-range (SR) modes are selected.

The 100G speed is irrelevant because it would require multiple fibers /
multiple SFP28 modules combined under one netdev.
sfp-bus.c only handles a single module per netdev, so only 25Gbps modes
are selected.

sfp_parse_support already handles SFF8024_ECC_100GBASE_SR4_25GBASE_SR
with compatible properties, however that entry is a contradiction in
itself since with SFP(28) 100GBASE_SR4 is impossible - that would likely
be a mode for qsfp modules only.

Add a case for SFF8024_ECC_100G_25GAUI_C2M_AOC selecting 25gbase-r
interface mode and 25000baseSR link mode.
Also enforce SFP28 bitrate limits on the values read from sfp eeprom as
requested by Russell King.

Tested with fs.com S28-AO02 AOC SFP28 module.

Subject: [PATCH] ftrace: Allow WITH_ARGS flavour of graph tracer with shadow
 call stack
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 38792972de4294163f44d6360fd221e6f2c22a05

[ Upstream commit 38792972de4294163f44d6360fd221e6f2c22a05 ]

The recent switch on arm64 from DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS to
DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_ARGS failed to take into account that we currently
require the former in order to allow the function graph tracer to be
enabled in combination with shadow call stacks. This means that this is
no longer permitted at all, in spite of the fact that either flavour of
ftrace works perfectly fine in this combination.

So permit WITH_ARGS as well as WITH_REGS.

Fixes: ddc9863e9e90 ("scs: Disable when function graph tracing is enabled")

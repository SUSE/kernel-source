commit 75a2f31520095600f650597c0ac41f48b5ba0068 upstream.

This ioctl() implicitly assumed that the socket was already bound to
a valid local socket name, i.e. Phonet object. If the socket was not
bound, two separate problems would occur:

1) We'd send an pipe enablement request with an invalid source object.
2) Later socket calls could BUG on the socket unexpectedly being
   connected yet not bound to a valid object.

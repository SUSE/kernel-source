Subject: [PATCH] arm64: entry: fix KCOV suppression
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.6
Git-commit: e6f85cbeb23bd74b8966cf1f15bf7d01399ff625

commit e6f85cbeb23bd74b8966cf1f15bf7d01399ff625 upstream.

We suppress KCOV for entry.o rather than entry-common.o. As entry.o is
built from entry.S, this is pointless, and permits instrumentation of
entry-common.o, which is built from entry-common.c.

Fix the Makefile to suppress KCOV for entry-common.o, as we had intended
to begin with. I've verified with objdump that this is working as
expected.

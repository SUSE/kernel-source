Subject: [PATCH] ACPI/NUMA: Apply SRAT proximity domain to entire CFMWS window
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.63
Git-commit: 8f1004679987302b155f14b966ca6d4335814fcb

[ Upstream commit 8f1004679987302b155f14b966ca6d4335814fcb ]

Commit fd49f99c1809 ("ACPI: NUMA: Add a node and memblk for each
CFMWS not in SRAT") did not account for the case where the BIOS
only partially describes a CFMWS Window in the SRAT. That means
the omitted address ranges, of a partially described CFMWS Window,
do not get assigned to a NUMA node.

Replace the call to phys_to_target_node() with numa_add_memblks().
Numa_add_memblks() searches an HPA range for existing memblk(s)
and extends those memblk(s) to fill the entire CFMWS Window.

Extending the existing memblks is a simple strategy that reuses
SRAT defined proximity domains from part of a window to fill out
the entire window, based on the knowledge* that all of a CFMWS
window is of a similar performance class.

*Note that this heuristic will evolve when CFMWS Windows present
a wider range of characteristics. The extension of the proximity
domain, implemented here, is likely a step in developing a more
sophisticated performance profile in the future.

There is no change in behavior when the SRAT does not describe
the CFMWS Window at all. In that case, a new NUMA node with a
single memblk covering the entire CFMWS Window is created.

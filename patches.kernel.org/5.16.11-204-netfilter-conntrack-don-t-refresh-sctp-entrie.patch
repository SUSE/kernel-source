Subject: [PATCH] netfilter: conntrack: don't refresh sctp entries in closed
 state
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.11
Git-commit: 77b337196a9d87f3d6bb9b07c0436ecafbffda1e

[ Upstream commit 77b337196a9d87f3d6bb9b07c0436ecafbffda1e ]

Vivek Thrivikraman reported:
 An SCTP server application which is accessed continuously by client
 application.
 When the session disconnects the client retries to establish a connection.
 After restart of SCTP server application the session is not established
 because of stale conntrack entry with connection state CLOSED as below.

 (removing this entry manually established new connection):

 sctp 9 CLOSED src=10.141.189.233 [..]  [ASSURED]

Just skip timeout update of closed entries, we don't want them to
stay around forever.

Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add missing documented NL params
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.11
Git-commit: 6813b1928758ce64fabbb8ef157f994b7c2235fa

commit 6813b1928758ce64fabbb8ef157f994b7c2235fa upstream.

'loc_id' and 'rem_id' are set in all events linked to subflows but those
were missing in the events description in the comments.

Fixes: b911c97c7dc7 ("mptcp: add netlink event support")

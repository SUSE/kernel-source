Subject: [PATCH] s390: fix nospec table alignments
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.8
Git-commit: c9305b6c1f52060377c72aebe3a701389e9f3172

commit c9305b6c1f52060377c72aebe3a701389e9f3172 upstream.

Add proper alignment for .nospec_call_table and .nospec_return_table in
vmlinux.

[hca@linux.ibm.com]: The problem with the missing alignment of the nospec
tables exist since a long time, however only since commit e6ed91fd0768
("s390/alternatives: remove padding generation code") and with
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n the kernel may also crash at boot time.

The above named commit reduced the size of struct alt_instr by one byte,
so its new size is 11 bytes. Therefore depending on the number of cpu
alternatives the size of the __alt_instructions array maybe odd, which
again also causes that the addresses of the nospec tables will be odd.

If the address of __nospec_call_start is odd and the kernel is compiled
With CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n the compiler may generate code that loads the
address of __nospec_call_start with a 'larl' instruction.

This will generate incorrect code since the 'larl' instruction only works
with even addresses. In result the members of the nospec tables will be
accessed with an off-by-one offset, which subsequently may lead to
addressing exceptions within __nospec_revert().

Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: update res mask in io_poll_check_events
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: b98186aee22fa593bc8c6b2c5d839c2ee518bc8c

commit b98186aee22fa593bc8c6b2c5d839c2ee518bc8c upstream.

When io_poll_check_events() collides with someone attempting to queue a
task work, it'll spin for one more time. However, it'll continue to use
the mask from the first iteration instead of updating it. For example,
if the first wake up was a EPOLLIN and the second EPOLLOUT, the
userspace will not get EPOLLOUT in time.

Clear the mask for all subsequent iterations to force vfs_poll().

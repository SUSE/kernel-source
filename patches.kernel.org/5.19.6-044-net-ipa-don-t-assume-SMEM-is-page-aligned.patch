Subject: [PATCH] net: ipa: don't assume SMEM is page-aligned
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.6
Git-commit: b8d4380365c515d8e0351f2f46d371738dd19be1

[ Upstream commit b8d4380365c515d8e0351f2f46d371738dd19be1 ]

In ipa_smem_init(), a Qualcomm SMEM region is allocated (if needed)
and then its virtual address is fetched using qcom_smem_get().  The
physical address associated with that region is also fetched.

The physical address is adjusted so that it is page-aligned, and an
attempt is made to update the size of the region to compensate for
any non-zero adjustment.

But that adjustment isn't done properly.  The physical address is
aligned twice, and as a result the size is never actually adjusted.

Fix this by *not* aligning the "addr" local variable, and instead
making the "phys" local variable be the adjusted "addr" value.

Subject: [PATCH] f2fs: compress: fix to check unreleased compressed cluster
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: eb8fbaa53374e0a2d4381190abfe708481517bbb

[ Upstream commit eb8fbaa53374e0a2d4381190abfe708481517bbb ]

Compressed cluster may not be released due to we can fail in
release_compress_blocks(), fix to handle reserved compressed
cluster correctly in reserve_compress_blocks().

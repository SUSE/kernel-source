Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp-pmics: fix pon compatible and
 registers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.26
Git-commit: ad8cd35c58ca3ec5e93f52a0124899627b98efb2

[ Upstream commit ad8cd35c58ca3ec5e93f52a0124899627b98efb2 ]

The pmk8280 PMIC PON peripheral is gen3 and uses two sets of registers;
hlos and pbs.

This specifically fixes the following error message during boot when the
pbs registers are not defined:

	PON_PBS address missing, can't read HW debounce time

Note that this also enables the spurious interrupt workaround introduced
by commit 0b65118e6ba3 ("Input: pm8941-pwrkey - add software key press
debouncing support") (which may or may not be needed).

Fixes: ccd3517faf18 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp: Add reference device")

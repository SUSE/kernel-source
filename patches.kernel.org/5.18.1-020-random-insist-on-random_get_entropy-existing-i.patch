Subject: [PATCH] random: insist on random_get_entropy() existing in order to
 simplify
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.1
Git-commit: 4b758eda851eb9336ca86a0041a4d3da55f66511

commit 4b758eda851eb9336ca86a0041a4d3da55f66511 upstream.

All platforms are now guaranteed to provide some value for
random_get_entropy(). In case some bug leads to this not being so, we
print a warning, because that indicates that something is really very
wrong (and likely other things are impacted too). This should never be
hit, but it's a good and cheap way of finding out if something ever is
problematic.

Since we now have viable fallback code for random_get_entropy() on all
platforms, which is, in the worst case, not worse than jiffies, we can
count on getting the best possible value out of it. That means there's
no longer a use for using jiffies as entropy input. It also means we no
longer have a reason for doing the round-robin register flow in the IRQ
handler, which was always of fairly dubious value.

Instead we can greatly simplify the IRQ handler inputs and also unify
the construction between 64-bits and 32-bits. We now collect the cycle
counter and the return address, since those are the two things that
matter. Because the return address and the irq number are likely
related, to the extent we mix in the irq number, we can just xor it into
the top unchanging bytes of the return address, rather than the bottom
changing bytes of the cycle counter as before. Then, we can do a fixed 2
rounds of SipHash/HSipHash. Finally, we use the same construction of
hashing only half of the [H]SipHash state on 32-bit and 64-bit. We're
not actually discarding any entropy, since that entropy is carried
through until the next time. And more importantly, it lets us do the
same sponge-like construction everywhere.

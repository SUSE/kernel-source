Subject: [PATCH] ksmbd: set v2 lease version on lease upgrade
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.76
Git-commit: bb05367a66a9990d2c561282f5620bb1dbe40c28

[ Upstream commit bb05367a66a9990d2c561282f5620bb1dbe40c28 ]

If file opened with v2 lease is upgraded with v1 lease, smb server
should response v2 lease create context to client.
This patch fix smb2.lease.v2_epoch2 test failure.

This test case assumes the following scenario:
 1. smb2 create with v2 lease(R, LEASE1 key)
 2. smb server return smb2 create response with v2 lease context(R,
LEASE1 key, epoch + 1)
 3. smb2 create with v1 lease(RH, LEASE1 key)
 4. smb server return smb2 create response with v2 lease context(RH,
LEASE1 key, epoch + 2)

i.e. If same client(same lease key) try to open a file that is being
opened with v2 lease with v1 lease, smb server should return v2 lease.

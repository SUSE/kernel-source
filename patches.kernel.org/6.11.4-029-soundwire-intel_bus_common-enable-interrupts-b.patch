Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: intel_bus_common: enable interrupts before exiting
 reset
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.4
Git-commit: 5aedb8d8336b0a0421b58ca27d1b572aa6695b5b

[ Upstream commit 5aedb8d8336b0a0421b58ca27d1b572aa6695b5b ]

The existing code enables the Cadence IP interrupts after the bus
reset sequence. The problem with this sequence is that it might be
pre-empted, giving SoundWire devices time to sync and report as
ATTACHED before the interrupts are enabled. In that case, the Cadence
IP will not detect a state change and will not throw an interrupt to
proceed with the enumeration of a Device0.

In our overnight stress tests, we observed that a slight
sub-millisecond delay in enabling interrupts after the reset was
correlated with detection failures. This problem is more prevalent on
the LunarLake silicon, likely due to SOC integration changes, but it
was observed on earlier generations as well.

This patch reverts the sequence, with the interrupts enabled before
performing the bus reset. This removes the race condition and makes
sure the Cadence IP is able to detect the presence of a Device0 in all
cases.

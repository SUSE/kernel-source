Subject: [PATCH] x86/apic: Always explicitly disarm TSC-deadline timer
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.58
Git-commit: ffd95846c6ec6cf1f93da411ea10d504036cab42

commit ffd95846c6ec6cf1f93da411ea10d504036cab42 upstream.

New processors have become pickier about the local APIC timer state
before entering low power modes. These low power modes are used (for
example) when you close your laptop lid and suspend. If you put your
laptop in a bag and it is not in this low power mode, it is likely
to get quite toasty while it quickly sucks the battery dry.

The problem boils down to some CPUs' inability to power down until the
CPU recognizes that the local APIC timer is shut down. The current
kernel code works in one-shot and periodic modes but does not work for
deadline mode. Deadline mode has been the supported and preferred mode
on Intel CPUs for over a decade and uses an MSR to drive the timer
instead of an APIC register.

Disable the TSC Deadline timer in lapic_timer_shutdown() by writing to
MSR_IA32_TSC_DEADLINE when in TSC-deadline mode. Also avoid writing
to the initial-count register (APIC_TMICT) which is ignored in
TSC-deadline mode.

Note: The APIC_LVTT|=APIC_LVT_MASKED operation should theoretically be
enough to tell the hardware that the timer will not fire in any of the
timer modes. But mitigating AMD erratum 411[1] also requires clearing
out APIC_TMICT. Solely setting APIC_LVT_MASKED is also ineffective in
practice on Intel Lunar Lake systems, which is the motivation for this
change.

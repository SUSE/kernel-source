Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: get zone unusable bytes while holding lock at
 btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 1283b8c125a83bf7a7dbe90c33d3472b6d7bf612

[ Upstream commit 1283b8c125a83bf7a7dbe90c33d3472b6d7bf612 ]

At btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work(), we are grabbing a block group's zone unusable
bytes while not under the protection of the block group's spinlock, so
this can trigger race reports from KCSAN (or similar tools) since that
field is typically updated while holding the lock, such as at
__btrfs_add_free_space_zoned() for example.

Fix this by grabbing the zone unusable bytes while we are still in the
critical section holding the block group's spinlock, which is right above
where we are currently grabbing it.

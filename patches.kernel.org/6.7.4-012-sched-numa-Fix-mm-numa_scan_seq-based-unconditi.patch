Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Fix mm numa_scan_seq based unconditional scan
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.4
Git-commit: 84db47ca7146d7bd00eb5cf2b93989a971c84650

[ Upstream commit 84db47ca7146d7bd00eb5cf2b93989a971c84650 ]

Since commit fc137c0ddab2 ("sched/numa: enhance vma scanning logic")

NUMA Balancing allows updating PTEs to trap NUMA hinting faults if the
task had previously accessed VMA. However unconditional scan of VMAs are
allowed during initial phase of VMA creation until process's
mm numa_scan_seq reaches 2 even though current task had not accessed VMA.

Rationale:
 - Without initial scan subsequent PTE update may never happen.
 - Give fair opportunity to all the VMAs to be scanned and subsequently
understand the access pattern of all the VMAs.

But it has a corner case where, if a VMA is created after some time,
process's mm numa_scan_seq could be already greater than 2.

For e.g., values of mm numa_scan_seq when VMAs are created by running
mmtest autonuma benchmark briefly looks like:
start_seq=0 : 459
start_seq=2 : 138
start_seq=3 : 144
start_seq=4 : 8
start_seq=8 : 1
start_seq=9 : 1
This results in no unconditional PTE updates for those VMAs created after
some time.

Fix:
 - Note down the initial value of mm numa_scan_seq in per VMA start_seq.
 - Allow unconditional scan till start_seq + 2.

Result:
SUT: AMD EPYC Milan with 2 NUMA nodes 256 cpus.
base kernel: upstream 6.6-rc6 with Mels patches [1] applied.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rt9120: Make dev PM runtime bind AsoC component PM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.7
Git-commit: 7161bd540eebebae2bbe8c79de25d8caf12dbf78

commit 7161bd540eebebae2bbe8c79de25d8caf12dbf78 upstream.

RT9120 uses PM runtime autosuspend to decrease the frequently on/off
spent time. This exists one case, when pcm is closed and dev PM is
waiting for autosuspend time expired to enter runtime suspend state.
At the mean time, system is going to enter suspend, dev PM runtime
suspend won't be called. It makes the rt9120 suspend consumption
current not as expected.

This patch can fix the rt9120 dev PM issue during runtime autosuspend
and system suspend by binding dev PM runtime and ASoC component PM.

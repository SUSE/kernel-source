Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: arm: realview: Fix development chip ROM compatible
 value
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: 3baa4c5143d65ebab2de0d99a395e5f4f1f46608

[ Upstream commit 3baa4c5143d65ebab2de0d99a395e5f4f1f46608 ]

When the development chip ROM was added, the "direct-mapped" compatible
value was already obsolete.  In addition, the device node lacked the
accompanying "probe-type" property, causing the old physmap_of_core
driver to fall back to trying all available probe types.
Unfortunately this fallback was lost when the DT and pdata cases were
merged.

Fix this by using the modern "mtd-rom" compatible value instead.

Fixes: 5c3f5edbe0a1dff3 ("ARM: realview: add flash devices to the PB1176 DTS")
Fixes: 642b1e8dbed7bbbf ("mtd: maps: Merge physmap_of.c into physmap-core.c")

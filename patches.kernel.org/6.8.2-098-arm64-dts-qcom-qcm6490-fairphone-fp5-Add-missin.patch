Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: qcm6490-fairphone-fp5: Add missing
 reserved-memory
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 5dbbe7e0a2b91ac5901ee188724a997004759171

[ Upstream commit 5dbbe7e0a2b91ac5901ee188724a997004759171 ]

It seems we also need to reserve a region of 81 MiB called "removed_mem"
otherwise we can easily hit the following error with higher RAM usage:

  [ 1467.809274] Internal error: synchronous external abort: 0000000096000010 [#2] SMP

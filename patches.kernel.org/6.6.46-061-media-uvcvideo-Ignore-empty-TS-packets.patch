Subject: [PATCH] media: uvcvideo: Ignore empty TS packets
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.46

[ Upstream commit 5cd7c25f6f0576073b3d03bc4cfb1e8ca63a1195 ]

Some SunplusIT cameras took a borderline interpretation of the UVC 1.5
standard, and fill the PTS and SCR fields with invalid data if the
package does not contain data.

"STC must be captured when the first video data of a video frame is put
on the USB bus."

Some SunplusIT devices send, e.g.,

buffer: 0xa7755c00 len 000012 header:0x8c stc 00000000 sof 0000 pts 00000000
buffer: 0xa7755c00 len 000012 header:0x8c stc 00000000 sof 0000 pts 00000000
buffer: 0xa7755c00 len 000668 header:0x8c stc 73779dba sof 070c pts 7376d37a

While the UVC specification meant that the first two packets shouldn't
have had the SCR bit set in the header.

This borderline/buggy interpretation has been implemented in a variety
of devices, from directly SunplusIT and from other OEMs that rebrand
SunplusIT products. So quirking based on VID:PID will be problematic.

All the affected modules have the following extension unit:
VideoControl Interface Descriptor:
  guidExtensionCode         {82066163-7050-ab49-b8cc-b3855e8d221d}

But the vendor plans to use that GUID in the future and fix the bug,
this means that we should use heuristic to figure out the broken
packets.

This patch takes care of this.

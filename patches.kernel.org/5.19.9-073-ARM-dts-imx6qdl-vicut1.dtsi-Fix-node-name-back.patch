Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6qdl-vicut1.dtsi: Fix node name backlight_led
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.9
Git-commit: 83c75e1bc2b83b3f0c718833bde677ebfa736283

[ Upstream commit 83c75e1bc2b83b3f0c718833bde677ebfa736283 ]

This naming error slipped through, so now that a new backlight node has
been added with correct spelling, fix this one also.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing
 is enabled
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.70
Git-commit: 44f52bbe96dfdbe4aca3818a2534520082a07040

[ Upstream commit 44f52bbe96dfdbe4aca3818a2534520082a07040 ]

When a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the
tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled
(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent
buffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths
that call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding
the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()
drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls
free_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent
buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,
the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()
and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()
is called, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to
btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.
This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag
code, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is
called there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.

Subject: [PATCH] dm-crypt: start allocating with MAX_ORDER
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.7
Git-commit: 13648e04a9b831b3dfa5cf3887dfa6cf8fe5fe69

[ Upstream commit 13648e04a9b831b3dfa5cf3887dfa6cf8fe5fe69 ]

Commit 23baf831a32c ("mm, treewide: redefine MAX_ORDER sanely")
changed the meaning of MAX_ORDER from exclusive to inclusive. So, we
can allocate compound pages with up to 1 << MAX_ORDER pages.

Reflect this change in dm-crypt and start trying to allocate compound
pages with MAX_ORDER.

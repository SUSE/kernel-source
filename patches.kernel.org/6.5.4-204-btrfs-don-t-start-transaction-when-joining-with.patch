Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: don't start transaction when joining with
 TRANS_JOIN_NOSTART
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.4
Git-commit: 4490e803e1fe9fab8db5025e44e23b55df54078b

commit 4490e803e1fe9fab8db5025e44e23b55df54078b upstream.

When joining a transaction with TRANS_JOIN_NOSTART, if we don't find a
running transaction we end up creating one. This goes against the purpose
of TRANS_JOIN_NOSTART which is to join a running transaction if its state
is at or below the state TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START, otherwise return an
-ENOENT error and don't start a new transaction. So fix this to not create
a new transaction if there's no running transaction at or below that
state.

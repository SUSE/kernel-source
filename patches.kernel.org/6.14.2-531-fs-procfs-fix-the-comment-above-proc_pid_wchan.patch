Subject: [PATCH] fs/procfs: fix the comment above proc_pid_wchan()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: 6287fbad1cd91f0c25cdc3a580499060828a8f30

[ Upstream commit 6287fbad1cd91f0c25cdc3a580499060828a8f30 ]

proc_pid_wchan() used to report kernel addresses to user space but that is
no longer the case today.  Bring the comment above proc_pid_wchan() in
sync with the implementation.

Subject: [PATCH] media: cedrus: Fix watchdog race condition
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: fe8b81fde69acfcbb5af9e85328e5b9549999fdb

commit fe8b81fde69acfcbb5af9e85328e5b9549999fdb upstream.

The watchdog needs to be scheduled before we trigger the decode
operation, otherwise there is a risk that the decoder IRQ will be
called before we have schedule the watchdog. As a side effect, the
watchdog would never be cancelled and its function would be called
at an inappropriate time.

This was observed while running Fluster with GStreamer as a backend.
Some programming error would cause the decoder IRQ to be call very
quickly after the trigger. Later calls into the driver would deadlock
due to the unbalanced state.

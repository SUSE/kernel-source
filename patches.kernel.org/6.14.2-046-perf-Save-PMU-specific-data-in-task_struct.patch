Subject: [PATCH] perf: Save PMU specific data in task_struct
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: cb4369129339060218baca718a578bb0b826e734

[ Upstream commit cb4369129339060218baca718a578bb0b826e734 ]

Some PMU specific data has to be saved/restored during context switch,
e.g. LBR call stack data. Currently, the data is saved in event context
structure, but only for per-process event. For system-wide event,
because of missing the LBR call stack data after context switch, LBR
callstacks are always shorter in comparison to per-process mode.

For example,
  Per-process mode:
  $perf record --call-graph lbr -- taskset -c 0 ./tchain_edit

  -   99.90%    99.86%  tchain_edit  tchain_edit       [.] f3
       99.86% _start
          __libc_start_main
          generic_start_main
          main
          f1
        - f2
             f3

  System-wide mode:
  $perf record --call-graph lbr -a -- taskset -c 0 ./tchain_edit

  -   99.88%    99.82%  tchain_edit  tchain_edit        [.] f3
   - 62.02% main
        f1
        f2
        f3
   - 28.83% f1
      - f2
        f3
   - 28.83% f1
      - f2
           f3
   - 8.88% generic_start_main
        main
        f1
        f2
        f3

It isn't practical to simply allocate the data for system-wide event in
CPU context structure for all tasks. We have no idea which CPU a task
will be scheduled to. The duplicated LBR data has to be maintained on
every CPU context structure. That's a huge waste. Otherwise, the LBR
data still lost if the task is scheduled to another CPU.

Save the pmu specific data in task_struct. The size of pmu specific data
is 788 bytes for LBR call stack. Usually, the overall amount of threads
doesn't exceed a few thousands. For 10K threads, keeping LBR data would
consume additional ~8MB. The additional space will only be allocated
during LBR call stack monitoring. It will be released when the
monitoring is finished.

Furthermore, moving task_ctx_data from perf_event_context to task_struct
can reduce complexity and make things clearer. E.g. perf doesn't need to
swap task_ctx_data on optimized context switch path.
This patch set is just the first step. There could be other
optimization/extension on top of this patch set. E.g. for cgroup
profiling, perf just needs to save/store the LBR call stack information
for tasks in specific cgroup. That could reduce the additional space.
Also, the LBR call stack can be available for software events, or allow
even debugging use cases, like LBRs on crash later.

Because of the alignment requirement of Intel Arch LBR, the Kmem cache
is used to allocate the PMU specific data. It's required when child task
allocates the space. Save it in struct perf_ctx_data.
The refcount in struct perf_ctx_data is used to track the users of pmu
specific data.

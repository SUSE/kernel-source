Subject: [PATCH] EDAC/skx: Fix overflows on the DRAM row address mapping
 arrays
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.2
Git-commit: 71b1e3ba3fed5a34c5fac6d3a15c2634b04c1eb7

[ Upstream commit 71b1e3ba3fed5a34c5fac6d3a15c2634b04c1eb7 ]

The current DRAM row address mapping arrays skx_{open,close}_row[]
only support ranks with sizes up to 16G. Decoding a rank address
to a DRAM row address for a 32G rank by using either one of the
above arrays by the skx_edac driver, will result in an overflow on
the array.

For a 32G rank, the most significant DRAM row address bit (the
bit17) is mapped from the bit34 of the rank address. Add this new
mapping item to both arrays to fix the overflow issue.

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in
 raid5d""
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 87165c64fe1a98bbab7280c58df3c83be2c98478

This reverts commit bed9e27baf52a09b7ba2a3714f1e24e17ced386d.

The original set [1][2] was expected to undo a suboptimal fix in [2], and
replace it with a better fix [1]. However, as reported by Dan Moulding [2]
causes an issue with raid5 with journal device.

Revert [2] for now to close the issue. We will follow up on another issue
reported by Juxiao Bi, as [2] is expected to fix it. We believe this is a
good trade-off, because the latter issue happens less freqently.

In the meanwhile, we will NOT revert [1], as it contains the right logic.

[1] commit d6e035aad6c0 ("md: bypass block throttle for superblock update")
[2] commit bed9e27baf52 ("Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d"")

Reported-by: Dan Moulding <dan@danm.net>

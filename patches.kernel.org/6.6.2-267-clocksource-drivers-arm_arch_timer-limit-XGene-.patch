Subject: [PATCH] clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: limit XGene-1 workaround
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.2
Git-commit: 851354cbd12bb9500909733c3d4054306f61df87

[ Upstream commit 851354cbd12bb9500909733c3d4054306f61df87 ]

The AppliedMicro XGene-1 CPU has an erratum where the timer condition
would only consider TVAL, not CVAL. We currently apply a workaround when
seeing the PartNum field of MIDR_EL1 being 0x000, under the assumption
that this would match only the XGene-1 CPU model.
However even the Ampere eMAG (aka XGene-3) uses that same part number, and
only differs in the "Variant" and "Revision" fields: XGene-1's MIDR is
0x500f0000, our eMAG reports 0x503f0002. Experiments show the latter
doesn't show the faulty behaviour.

Increase the specificity of the check to only consider partnum 0x000 and
variant 0x00, to exclude the Ampere eMAG.

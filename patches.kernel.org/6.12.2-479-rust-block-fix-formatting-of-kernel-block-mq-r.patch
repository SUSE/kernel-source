Subject: [PATCH] rust: block: fix formatting of `kernel::block::mq::request`
 module
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: 28e848386b92645f93b9f2fdba5882c3ca7fb3e2

[ Upstream commit 28e848386b92645f93b9f2fdba5882c3ca7fb3e2 ]

Fix several issues with rustdoc formatting for the
`kernel::block::mq::Request` module, in particular:

  - An ordered list not rendering correctly, fixed by using numbers
    prefixes instead of letters.

  - Code snippets formatted as regular text, fixed by wrapping the
    code with `back-ticks`.

  - References to types missing intra-doc links, fixed by wrapping the
    types with [square brackets].

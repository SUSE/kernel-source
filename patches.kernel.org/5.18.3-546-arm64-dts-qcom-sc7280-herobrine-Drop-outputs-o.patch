Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280-herobrine: Drop outputs on fpmcu
 pins
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: dbcbeed94f3b6f7f24349a7f335cc603a682e7a7

[ Upstream commit dbcbeed94f3b6f7f24349a7f335cc603a682e7a7 ]

Having these pins with outputs is good on a fresh boot because it puts
the boot and reset pins in a known "good" state. Unfortunately, that
conflicts with the fingerprint firmware flashing code. The firmware
flashing process binds and unbinds the cros-ec and spidev drivers and
that reapplies the pin output values after the flashing code has
overridden the gpio values. This causes a problem because we try to put
the device into bootloader mode, bind the spidev driver and that
inadvertently puts it right back into normal boot mode, breaking the
flashing process.

Fix this by removing the outputs. We'll introduce a binding for
fingerprint cros-ec specifically to set the gpios properly via gpio APIs
during cros-ec driver probe instead.

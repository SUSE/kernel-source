Subject: [PATCH] mm/debug_vm_pgtable: clear page table entries at
 destroy_args()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.44
Git-commit: dde30854bddfb5d69f30022b53c5955a41088b33

commit dde30854bddfb5d69f30022b53c5955a41088b33 upstream.

The mm/debug_vm_pagetable test allocates manually page table entries for
the tests it runs, using also its manually allocated mm_struct.  That in
itself is ok, but when it exits, at destroy_args() it fails to clear those
entries with the *_clear functions.

The problem is that leaves stale entries.  If another process allocates an
mm_struct with a pgd at the same address, it may end up running into the
stale entry.  This is happening in practice on a debug kernel with
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE=y, for example this is the output with some extra
debugging I added (it prints a warning trace if pgtables_bytes goes
negative, in addition to the warning at check_mm() function):

[    2.559022] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:000000002267cc9e type:MM_ANONPAGES val:1
[    2.559037] BUG: non-zero pgtables_bytes on freeing mm: -6144

Here the modprobe process ended up with an allocated mm_struct from the
mm_struct slab that was used before by the debug_vm_pgtable test.  That is
not a problem, since the mm_struct is initialized again etc., however, if
it ends up using the same pgd table, it bumps into the old stale entry
when clearing/freeing the page table entries, so it tries to free an entry
already gone (that one which was allocated by the debug_vm_pgtable test),
which also explains the negative pgtables_bytes since it's accounting for
not allocated entries in the current process.

As far as I looked pgd_{alloc,free} etc.  does not clear entries, and
clearing of the entries is explicitly done in the free_pgtables->
free_pgd_range->free_p4d_range->free_pud_range->free_pmd_range->
free_pte_range path.  However, the debug_vm_pgtable test does not call
free_pgtables, since it allocates mm_struct and entries manually for its
test and eg.  not goes through page faults.  So it also should clear
manually the entries before exit at destroy_args().

This problem was noticed on a reboot X number of times test being done on
a powerpc host, with a debug kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE enabled.
Depends on the system, but on a 100 times reboot loop the problem could
manifest once or twice, if a process ends up getting the right mm->pgd
entry with the stale entries used by mm/debug_vm_pagetable.  After using
this patch, I couldn't reproduce/experience the problems anymore.  I was
able to reproduce the problem as well on latest upstream kernel (6.16).

I also modified destroy_args() to use mmput() instead of mmdrop(), there
is no reason to hold mm_users reference and not release the mm_struct
entirely, and in the output above with my debugging prints I already had
patched it to use mmput, it did not fix the problem, but helped in the
debugging as well.

Subject: [PATCH] x86/entry: Remove skip_r11rcx
Patch-mainline: 5.18.14
References: CVE-2022-29900 CVE-2022-29901 bsc#1012628 bsc#1199657
Git-commit: 1b331eeea7b8676fc5dbdf80d0a07e41be226177

commit 1b331eeea7b8676fc5dbdf80d0a07e41be226177 upstream.

Yes, r11 and rcx have been restored previously, but since they're being
popped anyway (into rsi) might as well pop them into their own regs --
setting them to the value they already are.

Less magical code.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/rockchip: dw_hdmi_qp: Fix RK3576 HPD interrupt handling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: 5f7be8afc40c5ccf1be0410514703e50a49532c0

[ Upstream commit 5f7be8afc40c5ccf1be0410514703e50a49532c0 ]

The threaded interrupt handler on RK3576 checks HPD IRQ status before
deciding to continue with interrupt clearing and unmasking.

This is not only redundant, since a similar verification has been
already performed by the hard IRQ handler before masking the interrupt,
but is also error prone, because it might happen that hardware clears
the status register right after the masking operation completes, and
before the threaded handler reads its value.

The consequence is that HPD IRQ gets never unmasked, which breaks
hotplug detection until reloading the driver or rebooting the system.

Drop the unnecessary verification of the HPD interrupt status from the
threaded interrupt handler.

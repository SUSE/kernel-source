Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: Call early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() earlier
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: 9fa304b9f8ec440e614af6d35826110c633c4074

commit 9fa304b9f8ec440e614af6d35826110c633c4074 upstream.

The unflatten_and_copy_device_tree() function contains a call to
memblock_alloc(). This means that memblock is allocating memory before
any of the reserved memory regions are set aside in the arch_mem_init()
function which calls early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem(). Therefore,
there is a possibility for memblock to allocate from any of the
reserved memory regions.

Hence, move the call to early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() to be earlier
in the init sequence, so that the reserved memory regions are set aside
before any allocations are done using memblock.

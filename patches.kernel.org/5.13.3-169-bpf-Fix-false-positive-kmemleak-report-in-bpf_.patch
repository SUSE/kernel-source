Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Fix false positive kmemleak report in
 bpf_ringbuf_area_alloc()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.3
Git-commit: ccff81e1d028bbbf8573d3364a87542386c707bf

[ Upstream commit ccff81e1d028bbbf8573d3364a87542386c707bf ]

kmemleak scans struct page, but it does not scan the page content. If we
allocate some memory with kmalloc(), then allocate page with alloc_page(),
and if we put kmalloc pointer somewhere inside that page, kmemleak will
report kmalloc pointer as a false positive.

We can instruct kmemleak to scan the memory area by calling kmemleak_alloc()
and kmemleak_free(), but part of struct bpf_ringbuf is mmaped to user space,
and if struct bpf_ringbuf changes we would have to revisit and review size
argument in kmemleak_alloc(), because we do not want kmemleak to scan the
user space memory. Let's simplify things and use kmemleak_not_leak() here.

For posterity, also adding additional prior analysis from Andrii:

  I think either kmemleak or syzbot are misreporting this. I've added a
  bunch of printks around all allocations performed by BPF ringbuf. [...]
  On repro side I get these two warnings:

  [vmuser@archvm bpf]$ sudo ./repro

  Note that both reported leaks (ffff88810d538c80 and ffff88810d538c00)
  correspond to pages array bpf_ringbuf is allocating and tracking properly
  internally. Note also that syzbot repro doesn't close FD of created BPF
  ringbufs, and even when ./repro itself exits with error, there are still
  two forked processes hanging around in my system. So clearly ringbuf maps
  are alive at that point. So reporting any memory leak looks weird at that
  point, because that memory is being used by active referenced BPF ringbuf.

  It's also a question why repro doesn't clean up its forks. But if I do a
  `pkill repro`, I do see that all the allocated memory is /properly/ cleaned
  up [and the] "leaks" are deallocated properly.

  BTW, if I add close() right after bpf() syscall in syzbot repro, I see that
  everything is immediately deallocated, like designed. And no memory leak
  is reported. So I don't think the problem is anywhere in bpf_ringbuf code,
  rather in the leak detection and/or repro itself.

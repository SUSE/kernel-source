Subject: [PATCH] selftest: hugetlb_dio: fix test naming
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.5
Git-commit: 4ae132c693896b0713db572676c90ffd855a4246

commit 4ae132c693896b0713db572676c90ffd855a4246 upstream.

The string logged when a test passes or fails is used by the selftest
framework to identify which test is being reported.  The hugetlb_dio test
not only uses the same strings for every test that is run but it also uses
different strings for test passes and failures which means that test
automation is unable to follow what the test is doing at all.

Pull the existing duplicated logging of the number of free huge pages
before and after the test out of the conditional and replace that and the
logging of the result with a single ksft_print_result() which incorporates
the parameters passed into the test into the output.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: efi: Force the use of SetVirtualAddressMap() on eMAG
 and Altra Max machines
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.12
Git-commit: 190233164cd77115f8dea718cbac561f557092c6

commit 190233164cd77115f8dea718cbac561f557092c6 upstream.

Commit 550b33cfd445 ("arm64: efi: Force the use of SetVirtualAddressMap()
on Altra machines") identifies the Altra family via the family field in
the type#1 SMBIOS record. eMAG and Altra Max machines are similarly
affected but not detected with the strict strcmp test.

The type1_family smbios string is not an entirely reliable means of
identifying systems with this issue as OEMs can, and do, use their own
strings for these fields. However, until we have a better solution,
capture the bulk of these systems by adding strcmp matching for "eMAG"
and "Altra Max".

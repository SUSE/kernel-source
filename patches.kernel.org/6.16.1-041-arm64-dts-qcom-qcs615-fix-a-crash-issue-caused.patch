Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: qcs615: fix a crash issue caused by
 infinite loop for Coresight
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: bd4f35786d5f0798cc1f8c187a81a7c998e6c58f

[ Upstream commit bd4f35786d5f0798cc1f8c187a81a7c998e6c58f ]

An infinite loop has been created by the Coresight devices. When only a
source device is enabled, the coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink function
is recursively invoked in an attempt to locate an active sink device,
ultimately leading to a stack overflow and system crash. Therefore, disable
the replicator1 to break the infinite loop and prevent a potential stack
overflow.

side effect after the change:
Only trace data originating from AOSS can reach the ETF_SWAO and EUD sinks.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: cfg80211: fix regulatory disconnect with OCB/NAN
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: e8c2af660ba0790afd14d5cbc2fd05c6dc85e207

[ Upstream commit e8c2af660ba0790afd14d5cbc2fd05c6dc85e207 ]

Since regulatory disconnect was added, OCB and NAN interface
types were added, which made it completely unusable for any
driver that allowed OCB/NAN. Add OCB/NAN (though NAN doesn't
do anything, we don't have any info) and also remove all the
logic that opts out, so it won't be broken again if/when new
interface types are added.

Fixes: 6e0bd6c35b02 ("cfg80211: 802.11p OCB mode handling")
Fixes: cb3b7d87652a ("cfg80211: add start / stop NAN commands")

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: check if the transaction was aborted at
 btrfs_wait_for_commit()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.43
Git-commit: bf7ecbe9875061bf3fce1883e3b26b77f847d1e8

commit bf7ecbe9875061bf3fce1883e3b26b77f847d1e8 upstream.

At btrfs_wait_for_commit() we wait for a transaction to finish and then
always return 0 (success) without checking if it was aborted, in which
case the transaction didn't happen due to some critical error. Fix this
by checking if the transaction was aborted.

Subject: [PATCH] firmware: arm_ffa: Remove incorrect assignment of driver_data
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 00512d2930b338fdd42bd90bbd1793fe212c2d31

[ Upstream commit 00512d2930b338fdd42bd90bbd1793fe212c2d31 ]

The ffa core driver currently assigns its own driver information
to individual ffa device driver_data which is wrong. Firstly, it leaks
this core driver information to individual ffa_device and hence to
ffa_driver. Secondly the ffa_device driver_data is for use by individual
ffa_driver and not for this core driver managing all those devices.

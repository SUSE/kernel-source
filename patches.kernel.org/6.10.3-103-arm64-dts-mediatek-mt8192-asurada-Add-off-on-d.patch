Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8192-asurada: Add off-on-delay-us for
 pp3300_mipibrdg
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 897a7edba9330974726c564dfdbf4fb5e203b9ac

[ Upstream commit 897a7edba9330974726c564dfdbf4fb5e203b9ac ]

Set off-on-delay-us to 500000 us for pp3300_mipibrdg to make sure it
complies with the panel's unprepare delay (the time to power down
completely) of the power sequence. Explicit configuration on the
regulator node is required because mt8192-asurada uses the same power
supply for the panel and the anx7625 DP bridge.

For example, the power sequence could be violated in this sequence:
1. Bridge on: panel goes off, but regulator doesn't turn off (refcount=1).
2. Bridge off: regulator turns off (refcount=0).
3. Bridge resume -> regulator turns on but the bridge driver doesn't
   check the delay.

Or in this sequence:
1. Bridge on: panel goes off. The regulator doesn't turn off (refcount=1),
   but the .unprepared_time in panel_edp is still updated.
2. Bridge off, regulator goes off (refcount=0).
3. Panel on, but the panel driver uses the wrong .unprepared_time to check
   the unprepare delay.

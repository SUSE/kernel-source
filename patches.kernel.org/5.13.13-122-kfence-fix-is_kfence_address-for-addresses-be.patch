Subject: [PATCH] kfence: fix is_kfence_address() for addresses below
 KFENCE_POOL_SIZE
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.13
Git-commit: a7cb5d23eaea148f8582229846f8dfff192f05c3

[ Upstream commit a7cb5d23eaea148f8582229846f8dfff192f05c3 ]

Originally the addr != NULL check was meant to take care of the case
where __kfence_pool == NULL (KFENCE is disabled).  However, this does
not work for addresses where addr > 0 && addr < KFENCE_POOL_SIZE.

This can be the case on NULL-deref where addr > 0 && addr < PAGE_SIZE or
any other faulting access with addr < KFENCE_POOL_SIZE.  While the
kernel would likely crash, the stack traces and report might be
confusing due to double faults upon KFENCE's attempt to unprotect such
an address.

Fix it by just checking that __kfence_pool != NULL instead.

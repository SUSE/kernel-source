Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: cadence: Remove wasted space in response_buf
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.18
Git-commit: 827c32d0df4bbe0d1c47d79f6a5eabfe9ac75216

[ Upstream commit 827c32d0df4bbe0d1c47d79f6a5eabfe9ac75216 ]

The response_buf was declared much larger (128 entries) than the number
of responses that could ever be written into it. The Cadence IP is
configurable up to a maximum of 32 entries, and the datasheet says
that RX_FIFO_AVAIL can be 2 larger than this. So allow up to 34
responses.

Also add checking in cdns_read_response() to prevent overflowing
reponse_buf if RX_FIFO_AVAIL contains an unexpectedly large number.

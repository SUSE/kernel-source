Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Mitigate sockmap_ktls disconnect_after_delete
 failure
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: f2858f308131a09e33afb766cd70119b5b900569

[ Upstream commit f2858f308131a09e33afb766cd70119b5b900569 ]

"sockmap_ktls disconnect_after_delete" test has been failing on BPF CI
after recent merges from netdev:
* https://github.com/kernel-patches/bpf/actions/runs/14458537639
* https://github.com/kernel-patches/bpf/actions/runs/14457178732

It happens because disconnect has been disabled for TLS [1], and it
renders the test case invalid.

Removing all the test code creates a conflict between bpf and
bpf-next, so for now only remove the offending assert [2].

The test will be removed later on bpf-next.

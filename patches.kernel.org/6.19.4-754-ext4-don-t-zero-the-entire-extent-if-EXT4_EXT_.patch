Subject: [PATCH] ext4: don't zero the entire extent if
 EXT4_EXT_DATA_PARTIAL_VALID1
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: 1bf6974822d1dba86cf11b5f05498581cf3488a2

commit 1bf6974822d1dba86cf11b5f05498581cf3488a2 upstream.

When allocating initialized blocks from a large unwritten extent, or
when splitting an unwritten extent during end I/O and converting it to
initialized, there is currently a potential issue of stale data if the
extent needs to be split in the middle.

       0  A      B  N
       [UUUUUUUUUUUU]    U: unwritten extent
       [--DDDDDDDD--]    D: valid data
          |<-  ->| ----> this range needs to be initialized

ext4_split_extent() first try to split this extent at B with
EXT4_EXT_DATA_ENTIRE_VALID1 and EXT4_EXT_MAY_ZEROOUT flag set, but
ext4_split_extent_at() failed to split this extent due to temporary lack
of space. It zeroout B to N and mark the entire extent from 0 to N
as written.

       0  A      B  N
       [WWWWWWWWWWWW]    W: written extent
       [SSDDDDDDDDZZ]    Z: zeroed, S: stale data

ext4_split_extent() then try to split this extent at A with
EXT4_EXT_DATA_VALID2 flag set. This time, it split successfully and left
a stale written extent from 0 to A.

       0  A      B   N
       [WW|WWWWWWWWWW]
       [SS|DDDDDDDDZZ]

Fix this by pass EXT4_EXT_DATA_PARTIAL_VALID1 to ext4_split_extent_at()
when splitting at B, don't convert the entire extent to written and left
it as unwritten after zeroing out B to N. The remaining work is just
like the standard two-part split. ext4_split_extent() will pass the
EXT4_EXT_DATA_VALID2 flag when it calls ext4_split_extent_at() for the
second time, allowing it to properly handle the split. If the split is
successful, it will keep extent from 0 to A as unwritten.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests/resctrl: Fix a division by zero error on Hygon
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: 671ef08d9455f5754d1fc96f5a14e357d6b80936

[ Upstream commit 671ef08d9455f5754d1fc96f5a14e357d6b80936 ]

Change to adjust effective L3 cache size with SNC enabled change
introduced the snc_nodes_per_l3_cache() function to detect the Intel
Sub-NUMA Clustering (SNC) feature by comparing #CPUs in node0 with #CPUs
sharing LLC with CPU0. The function was designed to return:
  (1) >1: SNC mode is enabled.
  (2)  1: SNC mode is not enabled or not supported.

However, on certain Hygon CPUs, #CPUs sharing LLC with CPU0 is actually
less than #CPUs in node0. This results in snc_nodes_per_l3_cache()
returning 0 (calculated as cache_cpus / node_cpus).

This leads to a division by zero error in get_cache_size():
  *cache_size /= snc_nodes_per_l3_cache();

Causing the resctrl selftest to fail with:
  "Floating point exception (core dumped)"

Fix the issue by ensuring snc_nodes_per_l3_cache() returns 1 when SNC
mode is not supported on the platform.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: at91: tse850: the emac<->phy interface is rmii
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: dcdbc335a91a26e022a803e1a6b837266989c032

[ Upstream commit dcdbc335a91a26e022a803e1a6b837266989c032 ]

This went unnoticed until commit 7897b071ac3b ("net: macb: convert
to phylink") which tickled the problem. The sama5d3 emac has never
been capable of rgmii, and it all just happened to work before that
commit.

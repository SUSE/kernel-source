Subject: [PATCH] i2c: cadence: Avoid fifo clear after start
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.4
Git-commit: c2e55b449de7298a751ed0256251019d302af453

[ Upstream commit c2e55b449de7298a751ed0256251019d302af453 ]

The Driver unintentionally programs ctrl reg to clear the fifo, which
happens after the start of transaction. Previously, this was not an issue
as it involved read-modified-write. However, this issue breaks i2c reads
on QEMU, as i2c-read is executed before guest starts programming control
register.

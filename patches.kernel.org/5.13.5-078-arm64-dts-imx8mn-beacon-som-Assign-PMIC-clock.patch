Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx8mn-beacon-som: Assign PMIC clock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.5
Git-commit: 1de3aa8611d21d6be546ca1cd13ee05bdd650018

[ Upstream commit 1de3aa8611d21d6be546ca1cd13ee05bdd650018 ]

The PMIC throws an errors because the clock isn't assigned to it.
Fix this by assigning the clocks info.

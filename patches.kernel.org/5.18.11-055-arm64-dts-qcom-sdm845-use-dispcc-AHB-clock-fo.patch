Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: use dispcc AHB clock for mdss node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.11
Git-commit: 3ba500dee327e0261e728edec8a4f2f563d2760c

[ Upstream commit 3ba500dee327e0261e728edec8a4f2f563d2760c ]

It was noticed that on sdm845 after an MDSS suspend/resume cycle the
driver can not read HW_REV registers properly (they will return 0
instead). Chaning the "iface" clock from <&gcc GCC_DISP_AHB_CLK> to
<&dispcc DISP_CC_MDSS_AHB_CLK> fixes the issue.

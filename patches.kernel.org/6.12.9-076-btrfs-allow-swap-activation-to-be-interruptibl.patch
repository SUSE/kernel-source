Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: allow swap activation to be interruptible
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.9
Git-commit: 9a45022a0efadd99bcc58f7f1cc2b6fb3b808c40

[ Upstream commit 9a45022a0efadd99bcc58f7f1cc2b6fb3b808c40 ]

During swap activation we iterate over the extents of a file, then do
several checks for each extent, some of which may take some significant
time such as checking if an extent is shared. Since a file can have
many thousands of extents, this can be a very slow operation and it's
currently not interruptible. I had a bug during development of a previous
patch that resulted in an infinite loop when iterating the extents, so
a core was busy looping and I couldn't cancel the operation, which is very
annoying and requires a reboot. So make the loop interruptible by checking
for fatal signals at the end of each iteration and stopping immediately if
there is one.

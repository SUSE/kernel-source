Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: Disable wide bus support for SDM845
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: 83c4c67076c209787515e06fffd41dd0bdab09b9

[ Upstream commit 83c4c67076c209787515e06fffd41dd0bdab09b9 ]

When widebus was enabled for DisplayPort in commit c7c412202623
("drm/msm/dp: enable widebus on all relevant chipsets") it was clarified
that it is only supported on DPU 5.0.0 onwards which includes SC7180 on
DPU revision 6.2.  However, this patch missed that the description
structure for SC7180 is also reused for SDM845 (because of identical
io_start address) which is only DPU 4.0.0, leading to a wrongly enbled
widebus feature and corruption on that platform.

Create a separate msm_dp_desc_sdm845 structure for this SoC compatible,
with the wide_bus_supported flag turned off.

Fixes: c7c412202623 ("drm/msm/dp: enable widebus on all relevant chipsets")

commit a260f7d726fde52c0278bd3fa085a758639bcee2 upstream.

The Lenovo Thinkbook 14s Yoga ITL has 4 new symbols/shortcuts on their
F9-F11 and PrtSc keys:

F9:    Has a symbol of a head with a headset, the manual says "Service key"
F10:   Has a symbol of a telephone horn which has been picked up from the
       receiver, the manual says: "Answer incoming calls"
F11:   Has a symbol of a telephone horn which is resting on the receiver,
       the manual says: "Reject incoming calls"
PrtSc: Has a symbol of a siccor and a dashed ellipse, the manual says:
       "Open the Windows 'Snipping' Tool app"

This commit adds support for these 4 new hkey events.

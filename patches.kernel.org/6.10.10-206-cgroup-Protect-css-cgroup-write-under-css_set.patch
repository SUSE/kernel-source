Subject: [PATCH] cgroup: Protect css->cgroup write under css_set_lock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.10
Git-commit: 57b56d16800e8961278ecff0dc755d46c4575092

[ Upstream commit 57b56d16800e8961278ecff0dc755d46c4575092 ]

The writing of css->cgroup associated with the cgroup root in
rebind_subsystems() is currently protected only by cgroup_mutex.
However, the reading of css->cgroup in both proc_cpuset_show() and
proc_cgroup_show() is protected just by css_set_lock. That makes the
readers susceptible to racing problems like data tearing or caching.
It is also a problem that can be reported by KCSAN.

This can be fixed by using READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() to access
css->cgroup. Alternatively, the writing of css->cgroup can be moved
under css_set_lock as well which is done by this patch.

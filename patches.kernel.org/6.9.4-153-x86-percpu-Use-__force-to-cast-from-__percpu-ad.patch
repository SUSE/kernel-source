Subject: [PATCH] x86/percpu: Use __force to cast from __percpu address space
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.4
Git-commit: a55c1fdad5f61b4bfe42319694b23671a758cb28

[ Upstream commit a55c1fdad5f61b4bfe42319694b23671a758cb28 ]

Fix Sparse warning when casting from __percpu address space by using
__force in the cast. x86 named address spaces are not considered to
be subspaces of the generic (flat) address space, so explicit casts
are required to convert pointers between these address spaces and the
generic address space (the application should cast to uintptr_t and
apply the segment base offset). The cast to uintptr_t removes
__percpu address space tag and Sparse reports:

  warning: cast removes address space '__percpu' of expression

Use __force to inform Sparse that the cast is intentional.

Subject: [PATCH] bpf: drop unnecessary user-triggerable WARN_ONCE in verifierl
 log
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.7
Git-commit: cff36398bd4c7d322d424433db437f3c3391c491

[ Upstream commit cff36398bd4c7d322d424433db437f3c3391c491 ]

It's trivial for user to trigger "verifier log line truncated" warning,
as verifier has a fixed-sized buffer of 1024 bytes (as of now), and there are at
least two pieces of user-provided information that can be output through
this buffer, and both can be arbitrarily sized by user:
  - BTF names;
  - BTF.ext source code lines strings.

Verifier log buffer should be properly sized for typical verifier state
output. But it's sort-of expected that this buffer won't be long enough
in some circumstances. So let's drop the check. In any case code will
work correctly, at worst truncating a part of a single line output.

Subject: [PATCH] md: Don't wait for MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED for HOT_REMOVE_DISK
 ioctl
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.44
Git-commit: a1fd37f97808db4fa1bf55da0275790c42521e45

[ Upstream commit a1fd37f97808db4fa1bf55da0275790c42521e45 ]

Commit 90f5f7ad4f38 ("md: Wait for md_check_recovery before attempting
device removal.") explained in the commit message that failed device
must be reomoved from the personality first by md_check_recovery(),
before it can be removed from the array. That's the reason the commit
add the code to wait for MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED.

However, this is not the case now, because remove_and_add_spares() is
called directly from hot_remove_disk() from ioctl path, hence failed
device(marked faulty) can be removed from the personality by ioctl.

On the other hand, the commit introduced a performance problem that
if MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED is set and the array is not running, ioctl will
wait for 5s before it can return failure to user.

Since the waiting is not needed now, fix the problem by removing the
waiting.

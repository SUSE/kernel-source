Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404: fix bluetooth device address
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.34
Git-commit: f5f390a77f18eaeb2c93211a1b7c5e66b5acd423

commit f5f390a77f18eaeb2c93211a1b7c5e66b5acd423 upstream.

The 'local-bd-address' property is used to pass a unique Bluetooth
device address from the boot firmware to the kernel and should otherwise
be left unset so that the OS can prevent the controller from being used
until a valid address has been provided through some other means (e.g.
using btmgmt).

Fixes: 60f77ae7d1c1 ("arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404-evb: Enable uart3 and add Bluetooth")

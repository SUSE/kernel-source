Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm: do not remove already closed subflows
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.8
Git-commit: 58e1b66b4e4b8a602d3f2843e8eba00a969ecce2

commit 58e1b66b4e4b8a602d3f2843e8eba00a969ecce2 upstream.

It is possible to have in the list already closed subflows, e.g. the
initial subflow has been already closed, but still in the list. No need
to try to close it again, and increments the related counters again.

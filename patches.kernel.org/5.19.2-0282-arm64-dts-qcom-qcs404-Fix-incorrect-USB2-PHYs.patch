Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404: Fix incorrect USB2 PHYs assignment
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 58577966a42fc0b660b5e2c7c9e5a2241363ea83

[ Upstream commit 58577966a42fc0b660b5e2c7c9e5a2241363ea83 ]

Currently the DT for QCS404 SoC has setup for 2 USB2 PHYs with one each
assigned to USB3 controller and USB2 controller. This assignment is
incorrect which only works by luck: as when each USB HCI comes up it
configures the *other* controllers PHY which is enough to make them
happy. If, for any reason, we were to disable one of the controllers then
both would stop working.

This was a difficult inconsistency to be caught which was found while
trying to enable USB support in u-boot. So with all the required drivers
ported to u-boot, I couldn't get the same USB storage device enumerated
in u-boot which was being enumerated fine by the kernel.

The root cause of the problem came out to be that I wasn't enabling USB2
PHY: "usb2_phy_prim" in u-boot. Then I realised that via simply disabling
the same USB2 PHY currently assigned to USB2 host controller in the
kernel disabled enumeration for USB3 host controller as well.

So fix this inconsistency by correctly assigning USB2 PHYs.

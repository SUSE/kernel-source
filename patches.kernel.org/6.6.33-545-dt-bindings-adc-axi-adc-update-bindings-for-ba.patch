Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: adc: axi-adc: update bindings for backend
 framework
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.33
Git-commit: a032b921bdeba2274866daafc8e791edd609eb13

[ Upstream commit a032b921bdeba2274866daafc8e791edd609eb13 ]

'adi,adc-dev' is now deprecated and must not be used anymore. Hence,
also remove it from being required.

The reason why it's being deprecated is because the axi-adc CORE is now
an IIO service provider hardware (IIO backends) for consumers to make use
of. Before, the logic with 'adi,adc-dev' was the opposite (it was kind
of consumer referencing other nodes/devices) and that proved to be wrong
and to not scale.

Now, IIO consumers of this hardware are expected to reference it using the
io-backends property. Hence, the new '#io-backend-cells' is being added
so the device is easily identified as a provider.

Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: idxd: Do not call DMX TX callbacks during
 workqueue disable
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.8
Git-commit: 6744a030d81e456883bfbb627ac1f30465c1a989

commit 6744a030d81e456883bfbb627ac1f30465c1a989 upstream.

On driver unload any pending descriptors are flushed and pending
DMA descriptors are explicitly completed:
idxd_dmaengine_drv_remove() ->
	drv_disable_wq() ->
		idxd_wq_free_irq() ->
			idxd_flush_pending_descs() ->
				idxd_dma_complete_txd()

With this done during driver unload any remaining descriptor is
likely stuck and can be dropped. Even so, the descriptor may still
have a callback set that could no longer be accessible. An
example of such a problem is when the dmatest fails and the dmatest
module is unloaded. The failure of dmatest leaves descriptors with
dma_async_tx_descriptor::callback pointing to code that no longer
exist. This causes a page fault as below at the time the IDXD driver
is unloaded when it attempts to run the callback:
 BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc0665190
 #PF: supervisor instruction fetch in kernel mode
 #PF: error_code(0x0010) - not-present page

Fix this by clearing the callback pointers on the transmit
descriptors only when workqueue is disabled.

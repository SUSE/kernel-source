Subject: [PATCH] xsk: Honor SO_BINDTODEVICE on bind
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39

[ Upstream commit f7306acec9aae9893d15e745c8791124d42ab10a ]

Initial creation of an AF_XDP socket requires CAP_NET_RAW capability. A
privileged process might create the socket and pass it to a non-privileged
process for later use. However, that process will be able to bind the socket
to any network interface. Even though it will not be able to receive any
traffic without modification of the BPF map, the situation is not ideal.

Sockets already have a mechanism that can be used to restrict what interface
they can be attached to. That is SO_BINDTODEVICE.

To change the SO_BINDTODEVICE binding the process will need CAP_NET_RAW.

Make xsk_bind() honor the SO_BINDTODEVICE in order to allow safer workflow
when non-privileged process is using AF_XDP.

The intended workflow is following:

  1. First process creates a bare socket with socket(AF_XDP, ...).
  2. First process loads the XSK program to the interface.
  3. First process adds the socket fd to a BPF map.
  4. First process ties socket fd to a particular interface using
     SO_BINDTODEVICE.
  5. First process sends socket fd to a second process.
  6. Second process allocates UMEM.
  7. Second process binds socket to the interface with bind(...).
  8. Second process sends/receives the traffic.

All the steps above are possible today if the first process is privileged
and the second one has sufficient RLIMIT_MEMLOCK and no capabilities.
However, the second process will be able to bind the socket to any interface
it wants on step 7 and send traffic from it. With the proposed change, the
second process will be able to bind the socket only to a specific interface
chosen by the first process at step 4.

+SO_BINDTODEVICE setsockopt
+--------------------------
+
+This is a generic SOL_SOCKET option that can be used to tie AF_XDP
+socket to a particular network interface.  It is useful when a socket
+is created by a privileged process and passed to a non-privileged one.
+Once the option is set, kernel will refuse attempts to bind that socket
+to a different interface.  Updating the value requires CAP_NET_RAW.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: pm: Tear down pipelines only if DSP was active
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.26
Git-commit: 0b186bb06198653d74a141902a7739e0bde20cf4

commit 0b186bb06198653d74a141902a7739e0bde20cf4 upstream.

With PCI if the device was suspended it is brought back to full
power and then suspended again.

This doesn't happen when device is described via DT.

We need to make sure that we tear down pipelines only if the device
was previously active (thus the pipelines were setup).

Otherwise, we can break the use_count:

[  219.009743] sof-audio-of-imx8m 3b6e8000.dsp:
sof_ipc3_tear_down_all_pipelines: widget PIPELINE.2.SAI3.IN is still in use: count -1

and after this everything stops working.

Fixes: d185e0689abc ("ASoC: SOF: pm: Always tear down pipelines before DSP suspend")

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: keystone: Use devm_request_irq() to free
 "ks-pcie-error-irq" on exit
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.54
Git-commit: e51d05f523e43ce5d2bad957943a2b14f68078cd

commit e51d05f523e43ce5d2bad957943a2b14f68078cd upstream.

Commit under Fixes introduced the IRQ handler for "ks-pcie-error-irq".
The interrupt is acquired using "request_irq()" but is never freed if
the driver exits due to an error. Although the section in the driver that
invokes "request_irq()" has moved around over time, the issue hasn't been
addressed until now.

Fix this by using "devm_request_irq()" which automatically frees the
interrupt if the driver exits.

Subject: [PATCH] tpm: Check for completion after timeout
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: d4640c394f23b202a89512346cf28f6622a49031

[ Upstream commit d4640c394f23b202a89512346cf28f6622a49031 ]

The current implementation of timeout detection works in the following
way:

1. Read completion status. If completed, return the data
2. Sleep for some time (usleep_range)
3. Check for timeout using current jiffies value. Return an error if
   timed out
4. Goto 1

usleep_range doesn't guarantee it's always going to wake up strictly in
(min, max) range, so such a situation is possible:

1. Driver reads completion status. No completion yet
2. Process sleeps indefinitely. In the meantime, TPM responds
3. We check for timeout without checking for the completion again.
   Result is lost.

Such a situation also happens for the guest VMs: if vCPU goes to sleep
and doesn't get scheduled for some time, the guest TPM driver will
timeout instantly after waking up without checking for the completion
(which may already be in place).

Perform the completion check once again after exiting the busy loop in
order to give the device the last chance to send us some data.

Since now we check for completion in two places, extract this check into
a separate function.

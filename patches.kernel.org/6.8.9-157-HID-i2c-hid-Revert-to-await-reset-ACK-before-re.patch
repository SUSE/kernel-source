Subject: [PATCH] HID: i2c-hid: Revert to await reset ACK before reading report
 descriptor
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.9
Git-commit: ea36bf1827462e4a52365bf8e3f7d1712c5d9600

commit ea36bf1827462e4a52365bf8e3f7d1712c5d9600 upstream.

In af93a167eda9, i2c_hid_parse was changed to continue with reading the
report descriptor before waiting for reset to be acknowledged.

This has lead to two regressions:

1. We fail to handle reset acknowledgment if it happens while reading
   the report descriptor. The transfer sets I2C_HID_READ_PENDING, which
   causes the IRQ handler to return without doing anything.

   This affects both a Wacom touchscreen and a Sensel touchpad.

2. On a Sensel touchpad, reading the report descriptor this quickly
   after reset results in all zeroes or partial zeroes.

The issues were observed on the Lenovo Thinkpad Z16 Gen 2.

The change in question was made based on a Microsoft article[0] stating
that Windows 8 *may* read the report descriptor in parallel with
awaiting reset acknowledgment, intended as a slight reset performance
optimization. Perhaps they only do this if reset is not completing
quickly enough for their tastes?

As the code is not currently ready to read registers in parallel with a
pending reset acknowledgment, and as reading quickly breaks the report
descriptor on the Sensel touchpad, revert to waiting for reset
acknowledgment before proceeding to read the report descriptor.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: broadcom: bcm4908: use proper TWD binding
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit 33826e9c6ba76b265d4e26cb95493fa27ed78974 ]

Block at <ff800400 0x4c> is a TWD that contains timers, watchdog and
reset. Actual timers happen to be at block beginning but they only span
across the first 0x28 registers. It means the old block description was
incorrect (size 0x3c).

Drop timers binding for now and use documented TWD binding. Timers
should be properly documented and defined as TWD subnode.

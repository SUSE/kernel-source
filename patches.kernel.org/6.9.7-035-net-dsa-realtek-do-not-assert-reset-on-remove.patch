Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: realtek: do not assert reset on remove
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.7
Git-commit: 4f580e9aced1816398c1c64f178302a22b8ea6e2

[ Upstream commit 4f580e9aced1816398c1c64f178302a22b8ea6e2 ]

The necessity of asserting the reset on removal was previously
questioned, as DSA's own cleanup methods should suffice to prevent
traffic leakage[1].

When a driver has subdrivers controlled by devres, they will be
unregistered after the main driver's .remove is executed. If it asserts
a reset, the subdrivers will be unable to communicate with the hardware
during their cleanup. For LEDs, this means that they will fail to turn
off, resulting in a timeout error.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix uninitialized parent in insert_state
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.4
Git-commit: d7c9e1be2876f63fb2178a24e0c1d5733ff98d47

commit d7c9e1be2876f63fb2178a24e0c1d5733ff98d47 upstream.

I don't know how this isn't caught when we build this in the kernel, but
while syncing extent-io-tree.c into btrfs-progs I got an error because
parent could potentially be uninitialized when we link in a new node,
specifically when the extent_io_tree is empty.  This means we could have
garbage in the parent color.  I don't know what the ramifications are of
that, but it's probably not great, so fix this by initializing parent to
NULL.  I spot checked all of our other usages in btrfs and we appear to
be doing the correct thing everywhere else.

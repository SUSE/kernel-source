Subject: [PATCH] s390/mm: Remove possible false-positive warning in
 pte_free_defer()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.42
Git-commit: 5647f61ad9171e8f025558ed6dc5702c56a33ba3

commit 5647f61ad9171e8f025558ed6dc5702c56a33ba3 upstream.

Commit 8211dad627981 ("s390: add pte_free_defer() for pgtables sharing
page") added a warning to pte_free_defer(), on our request. It was meant
to warn if this would ever be reached for KVM guest mappings, because
the page table would be freed w/o a gmap_unlink(). THP mappings are not
allowed for KVM guests on s390, so this should never happen.

However, it is possible that the warning is triggered in a valid case as
false-positive.

s390_enable_sie() takes the mmap_lock, marks all VMAs as VM_NOHUGEPAGE and
splits possibly existing THP guest mappings. mm->context.has_pgste is set
to 1 before that, to prevent races with the mm_has_pgste() check in
MADV_HUGEPAGE.

khugepaged drops the mmap_lock for file mappings and might run in parallel,
before a vma is marked VM_NOHUGEPAGE, but after mm->context.has_pgste was
set to 1. If it finds file mappings to collapse, it will eventually call
pte_free_defer(). This will trigger the warning, but it is a valid case
because gmap is not yet set up, and the THP mappings will be split again.

Therefore, remove the warning and the comment.

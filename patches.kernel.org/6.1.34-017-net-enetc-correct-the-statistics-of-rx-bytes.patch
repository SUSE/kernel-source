Subject: [PATCH] net: enetc: correct the statistics of rx bytes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.34
Git-commit: 7190d0ff0e17690a9b1279d84a06473600ba2060

[ Upstream commit 7190d0ff0e17690a9b1279d84a06473600ba2060 ]

The rx_bytes of struct net_device_stats should count the length of
ethernet frames excluding the FCS. However, there are two problems
with the rx_bytes statistics of the current enetc driver. one is
that the length of VLAN header is not counted if the VLAN extraction
feature is enabled. The other is that the length of L2 header is not
counted, because eth_type_trans() is invoked before updating rx_bytes
which will subtract the length of L2 header from skb->len.
BTW, the rx_bytes statistics of XDP path also have similar problem,
I will fix it in another patch.

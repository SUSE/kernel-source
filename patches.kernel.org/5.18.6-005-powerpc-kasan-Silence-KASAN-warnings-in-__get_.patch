Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/kasan: Silence KASAN warnings in __get_wchan()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.6

[ Upstream commit a1b29ba2f2c171b9bea73be993bfdf0a62d37d15 ]

The following KASAN warning was reported in our kernel.

  BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in get_wchan+0x188/0x250
  Read of size 4 at addr d216f958 by task ps/14437

  The buggy address belongs to the page:

After looking into this issue, I find the buggy address belongs
to the task stack region. It seems KASAN has something wrong.
I look into the code of __get_wchan in x86 architecture and
find the same issue has been resolved by the commit
f7d27c35ddff ("x86/mm, kasan: Silence KASAN warnings in get_wchan()").
The solution could be applied to powerpc architecture too.

As Andrey Ryabinin said, get_wchan() is racy by design, it may
access volatile stack of running task, thus it may access
redzone in a stack frame and cause KASAN to warn about this.

Use READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() to silence these warnings.

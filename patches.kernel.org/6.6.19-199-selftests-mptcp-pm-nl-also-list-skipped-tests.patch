Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: pm nl: also list skipped tests
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: d2a2547565a9f1ad7989f7e21f97cbf065a9390d

commit d2a2547565a9f1ad7989f7e21f97cbf065a9390d upstream.

If the feature is not supported by older kernels, and instead of just
ignoring some tests, we should mark them as skipped, so we can still
track them.

Fixes: d85555ac11f9 ("selftests: mptcp: pm_netlink: format subtests results in TAP")

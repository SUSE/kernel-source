Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: reset DP controller before transmit phy test
 pattern
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 581d69981159b00f0443d171a4b900089f34ccfe

[ Upstream commit 581d69981159b00f0443d171a4b900089f34ccfe ]

DP controller state can not switch from video ready state to
transmit phy pattern state at run time. DP mainlink has to be
teared down followed by reset controller to default state to have
DP controller switch to transmit phy test pattern state and start
generate specified phy test pattern to sinker once main link setup
again.

Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon: fix divide by zero in damon_get_intervals_score()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.7
Git-commit: bd225b9591442065beb876da72656f4a2d627d03

commit bd225b9591442065beb876da72656f4a2d627d03 upstream.

The current implementation allows having zero size regions with no special
reasons, but damon_get_intervals_score() gets crashed by divide by zero
when the region size is zero.

  [   29.403950] Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI

This patch fixes the bug, but does not disallow zero size regions to keep
the backward compatibility since disallowing zero size regions might be a
breaking change for some users.

In addition, the same crash can happen when intervals_goal.access_bp is
zero so this should be fixed in stable trees as well.

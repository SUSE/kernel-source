Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Preserve crtc_state->inherited during state
 clearing

commit 3a84f2c6c9558c554a90ec26ad25df92fc5e05b7 upstream.

intel_crtc_prepare_cleared_state() is unintentionally losing
the "inherited" flag. This will happen if intel_initial_commit()
is forced to go through the full modeset calculations for
whatever reason.

Afterwards the first real commit from userspace will not get
forced to the full modeset path, and thus eg. audio state may
not get recomputed properly. So if the monitor was already
enabled during boot audio will not work until userspace itself
does an explicit full modeset.

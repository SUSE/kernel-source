Subject: [PATCH] ceph: select FS_ENCRYPTION_ALGS if FS_ENCRYPTION
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 9c896d6bc3dfef86659a6a1fb25ccdea5dbef6a3

commit 9c896d6bc3dfef86659a6a1fb25ccdea5dbef6a3 upstream.

The kconfig options for filesystems that support FS_ENCRYPTION are
supposed to select FS_ENCRYPTION_ALGS.  This is needed to ensure that
required crypto algorithms get enabled as loadable modules or builtin as
is appropriate for the set of enabled filesystems.  Do this for CEPH_FS
so that there aren't any missing algorithms if someone happens to have
CEPH_FS as their only enabled filesystem that supports encryption.

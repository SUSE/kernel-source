Subject: [PATCH] page_pool: avoid infinite loop to schedule delayed worker
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.3
Git-commit: 43130d02baa137033c25297aaae95fd0edc41654

[ Upstream commit 43130d02baa137033c25297aaae95fd0edc41654 ]

We noticed the kworker in page_pool_release_retry() was waken
up repeatedly and infinitely in production because of the
buggy driver causing the inflight less than 0 and warning
us in page_pool_inflight()[1].

Since the inflight value goes negative, it means we should
not expect the whole page_pool to get back to work normally.

This patch mitigates the adverse effect by not rescheduling
the kworker when detecting the inflight negative in
page_pool_release_retry().

Note: before this patch, the above calltrace would flood the
dmesg due to repeated reschedule of release_dw kworker.

commit 90b8596ac46043e4a782d9111f5b285251b13756 upstream.

Hans de Goede reported Bluetooth adapters (HCIs) connected over an UART
connection failed due corrupted Rx payload. The problem was narrowed
down to DMA Rx starting on UART_IIR_THRI interrupt. The problem occurs
despite LSR having DR bit set, which is precondition for attempting to
start DMA Rx in the first place.

From a debug patch:
[x.807834] 8250irq: iir=cc lsr+saved=60 received=0/15 ier=0f dma_t/rx/err=0/0/0
[x.808676] 8250irq: iir=c2 lsr+saved=61 received=0/0 ier=0f dma_t/rx/err=0/0/0
[x.808776] 8250irq: iir=cc lsr+saved=60 received=1/12 ier=0d dma_t/rx/err=0/1/0
[x.808870] Bluetooth: hci0: Frame reassembly failed (-84)

In the debug snippet, received field indicates 1 byte was transferred
over DMA and 12 bytes after that with the non-DMA Rx. The sole byte DMA
handled was corrupted (gets zeroed) which leads to the HCI failure.

This problem became apparent after commit e8ffbb71f783 ("serial: 8250:
use THRE & __stop_tx also with DMA") changed Tx stop behavior. Tx stop
is now triggered from a THRI interrupt.

Despite that this problem looks like a HW bug, this fix is not adding
UART_BUG_xx flag to the driver beucase it seems useful in general to
avoid starting DMA when there are only a few bytes to transfer.
Skipping DMA for small transfers avoids the extra overhead DMA incurs.

Thus, don't setup DMA Rx on UART_IIR_THRI but leave it to a subsequent
interrupt which has Rx a related IIR value.

By returning false from handle_rx_dma(), the DMA vs non-DMA decision is
postponed until either UART_IIR_RDI (FIFO threshold worth of bytes
awaiting) or UART_IIR_TIMEOUT (inter-character timeout) triggers at a
later time which allows better to discern whether the number of bytes
warrants starting DMA or not.

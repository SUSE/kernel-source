Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/mtl: Update workaround 14018575942
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.5
Git-commit: 186bce682772e7346bf7ced5325b5f4ff050ccfb

[ Upstream commit 186bce682772e7346bf7ced5325b5f4ff050ccfb ]

Applying WA 14018575942 only on Compute engine has impact on
some apps like chrome. Updating this WA to apply on Render
engine as well as it is helping with performance on Chrome.

Note: There is no concern from media team thus not applying
WA on media engines. We will revisit if any issues reported
from media team.

V2(Matt):
 - Use correct WA number

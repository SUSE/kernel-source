Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62p5-sk: Enable CPSW MDIO node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 8839a9af397e803e0447a6b3e69fad54ed22d26d

[ Upstream commit 8839a9af397e803e0447a6b3e69fad54ed22d26d ]

Enable the CPSW MDIO node, and link the pinctrl information to enable
ethernet on SK-AM62P.

Ethernet was unintentally broken on this board, even though these nodes
were already present, as enabling them was missed in the original
patch.

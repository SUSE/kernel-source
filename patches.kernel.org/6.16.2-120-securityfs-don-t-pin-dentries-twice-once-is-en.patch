Subject: [PATCH] securityfs: don't pin dentries twice, once is enough...
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: 27cd1bf1240d482e4f02ca4f9812e748f3106e4f

[ Upstream commit 27cd1bf1240d482e4f02ca4f9812e748f3106e4f ]

incidentally, securityfs_recursive_remove() is broken without that -
it leaks dentries, since simple_recursive_removal() does not expect
anything of that sort.  It could be worked around by dput() in
remove_one() callback, but it's easier to just drop that double-get
stuff.

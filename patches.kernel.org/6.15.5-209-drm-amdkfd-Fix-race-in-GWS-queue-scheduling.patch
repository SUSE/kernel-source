Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdkfd: Fix race in GWS queue scheduling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.5
Git-commit: cfb05257ae168a0496c7637e1d9e3ab8a25cbffe

commit cfb05257ae168a0496c7637e1d9e3ab8a25cbffe upstream.

q->gws is not updated atomically with qpd->mapped_gws_queue. If a
runlist is created between pqm_set_gws and update_queue it will
contain a queue which uses GWS in a process with no GWS allocated.
This will result in a scheduler hang.

Use q->properties.is_gws which is changed while holding the DQM lock.

Subject: [PATCH] power: supply: bq25980: Fix use-after-free in
 power_supply_changed()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: 5f0b1cb41906e86b64bf69f5ededb83b0d757c27

[ Upstream commit 5f0b1cb41906e86b64bf69f5ededb83b0d757c27 ]

Using the `devm_` variant for requesting IRQ _before_ the `devm_`
variant for allocating/registering the `power_supply` handle, means that
the `power_supply` handle will be deallocated/unregistered _before_ the
interrupt handler (since `devm_` naturally deallocates in reverse
allocation order). This means that during removal, there is a race
condition where an interrupt can fire just _after_ the `power_supply`
handle has been freed, *but* just _before_ the corresponding
unregistration of the IRQ handler has run.

This will lead to the IRQ handler calling `power_supply_changed()` with
a freed `power_supply` handle. Which usually crashes the system or
otherwise silently corrupts the memory...

Note that there is a similar situation which can also happen during
`probe()`; the possibility of an interrupt firing _before_ registering
the `power_supply` handle. This would then lead to the nasty situation
of using the `power_supply` handle *uninitialized* in
`power_supply_changed()`.

Fix this racy use-after-free by making sure the IRQ is requested _after_
the registration of the `power_supply` handle.

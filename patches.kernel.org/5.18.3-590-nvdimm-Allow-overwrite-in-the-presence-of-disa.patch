Subject: [PATCH] nvdimm: Allow overwrite in the presence of disabled dimms
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: bb7bf697fed58eae9d3445944e457ab0de4da54f

[ Upstream commit bb7bf697fed58eae9d3445944e457ab0de4da54f ]

It is not clear why the original implementation of overwrite support
required the dimm driver to be active before overwrite could proceed. In
fact that can lead to cases where the kernel retains an invalid cached
copy of the labels from before the overwrite. Unfortunately the kernel
has not only allowed that case, but enforced it.

Going forward, allow for overwrite to happen while the label area is
offline, and follow-on with updates to 'ndctl sanitize-dimm --overwrite'
to trigger the label area invalidation by default.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix PHY handling for ROCK 4D
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: cd803da7c033e376a66793a43ee98e136bc6cc25

[ Upstream commit cd803da7c033e376a66793a43ee98e136bc6cc25 ]

Old revisions of the ROCK 4D board have a dedicated crystal to
supply the RTL8211F PHY's 25MHz clock input. At least some newer
revisions instead use REFCLKO25M_GMAC0_OUT. The DT already has
this half-prepared, but there are some issues:

1. The DT relies on auto-selecting the right PHY driver, which
   requires that it works good enough to read the ID registers.
   This does not work without the clock, which is handled by
   the PHY driver. By updating the compatible to contain the
   RTL8211F IDs, so that the operating system can choose the
   right PHY driver without relying on a pre-powered PHY.

2. Despite the name REFCLKO25M_GMAC0_OUT could also provide a
   different frequency, so ensure it is explicitly set to 25
   MHz as expected by the PHY.

3. While at it switch from deprecated "enable-gpio" to standard
   "enable-gpios".

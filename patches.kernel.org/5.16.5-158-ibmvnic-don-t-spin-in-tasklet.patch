Subject: [PATCH] ibmvnic: don't spin in tasklet
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.5
Git-commit: 48079e7fdd0269d66b1d7d66ae88bd03162464ad

[ Upstream commit 48079e7fdd0269d66b1d7d66ae88bd03162464ad ]

ibmvnic_tasklet() continuously spins waiting for responses to all
capability requests. It does this to avoid encountering an error
during initialization of the vnic. However if there is a bug in the
VIOS and we do not receive a response to one or more queries the
tasklet ends up spinning continuously leading to hard lock ups.

If we fail to receive a message from the VIOS it is reasonable to
timeout the login attempt rather than spin indefinitely in the tasklet.

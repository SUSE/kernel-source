Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor: Keep pm6150_adc enabled for
 TZ
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 144fbd028fdec2deeb3b99d5e60dbf3167950ebe

[ Upstream commit 144fbd028fdec2deeb3b99d5e60dbf3167950ebe ]

There's still a thermal zone using pm6150_adc in the pm6150.dtsi file,
pm6150_thermal. It's not super obvious because it indirectly uses the
adc through an iio channel in pm6150_temp. Let's keep this enabled on
lazor and coachz so that reading the temperature of the pm6150_thermal
zone continues to work. Otherwise we get -EINVAL when reading the zone,
and I suspect the PMIC temperature trip doesn't work properly so we
don't shutdown when the PMIC overheats.

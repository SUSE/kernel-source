Subject: [PATCH] riscv: kvm: move extern sbi_ext declarations to a header
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.8
Git-commit: 3e5e56c60a14776e2a49837b55b03bc193fd91f7

[ Upstream commit 3e5e56c60a14776e2a49837b55b03bc193fd91f7 ]

Sparse complains about missing statics in the declarations of several
variables:
arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_sbi_replace.c:38:37: warning: symbol 'vcpu_sbi_ext_time' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_sbi_replace.c:73:37: warning: symbol 'vcpu_sbi_ext_ipi' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_sbi_replace.c:126:37: warning: symbol 'vcpu_sbi_ext_rfence' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_sbi_replace.c:170:37: warning: symbol 'vcpu_sbi_ext_srst' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_sbi_base.c:69:37: warning: symbol 'vcpu_sbi_ext_base' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_sbi_base.c:90:37: warning: symbol 'vcpu_sbi_ext_experimental' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_sbi_base.c:96:37: warning: symbol 'vcpu_sbi_ext_vendor' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_sbi_hsm.c:115:37: warning: symbol 'vcpu_sbi_ext_hsm' was not declared. Should it be static?

These variables are however used in vcpu_sbi.c where they are declared
as extern. Move them to kvm_vcpu_sbi.h which is handily already
included by the three other files.

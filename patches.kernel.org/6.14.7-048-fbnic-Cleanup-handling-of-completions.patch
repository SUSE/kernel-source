Subject: [PATCH] fbnic: Cleanup handling of completions
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.7
Git-commit: cdbb2dc3996a60ed3d7431c1239a8ca98c778e04

[ Upstream commit cdbb2dc3996a60ed3d7431c1239a8ca98c778e04 ]

There was an issue in that if we were to shutdown we could be left with
a completion in flight as the mailbox went away. To address that I have
added an fbnic_mbx_evict_all_cmpl function that is meant to essentially
create a "broken pipe" type response so that all callers will receive an
error indicating that the connection has been broken as a result of us
shutting down the mailbox.

Fixes: 378e5cc1c6c6 ("eth: fbnic: hwmon: Add completion infrastructure for firmware requests")

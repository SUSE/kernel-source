Subject: [PATCH] selftests: net: no_forwarding: fix VID for $swp2 in
 one_bridge_two_pvids() test
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.57
Git-commit: 9f49d14ec41ce7be647028d7d34dea727af55272

[ Upstream commit 9f49d14ec41ce7be647028d7d34dea727af55272 ]

Currently, the second bridge command overwrites the first one.
Fix this by adding this VID to the interface behind $swp2.

The one_bridge_two_pvids() test intends to check that there is no
leakage of traffic between bridge ports which have a single VLAN - the
PVID VLAN.

Because of a typo, port $swp1 is configured with a PVID twice (second
command overwrites first), and $swp2 isn't configured at all (and since
the bridge vlan_default_pvid property is set to 0, this port will not
have a PVID at all, so it will drop all untagged and priority-tagged
traffic).

So, instead of testing the configuration that was intended, we are
testing a different one, where one port has PVID 2 and the other has
no PVID. This incorrect version of the test should also pass, but is
ineffective for its purpose, so fix the typo.

This typo has an impact on results of the test,
potentially leading to wrong conclusions regarding
the functionality of a network device.

The tests results:

TEST: Switch ports in VLAN-aware bridge with different PVIDs:
	Unicast non-IP untagged   [ OK ]
	Multicast non-IP untagged   [ OK ]
	Broadcast non-IP untagged   [ OK ]
	Unicast IPv4 untagged   [ OK ]

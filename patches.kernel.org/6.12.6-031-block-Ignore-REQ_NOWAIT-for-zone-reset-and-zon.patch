Subject: [PATCH] block: Ignore REQ_NOWAIT for zone reset and zone finish
 operations
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.6
Git-commit: 5eb3317aa5a2ffe4574ab1a12cf9bc9447ca26c0

commit 5eb3317aa5a2ffe4574ab1a12cf9bc9447ca26c0 upstream.

There are currently any issuer of REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET and
REQ_OP_ZONE_FINISH operations that set REQ_NOWAIT. However, as we cannot
handle this flag correctly due to the potential request allocation
failure that may happen in blk_mq_submit_bio() after blk_zone_plug_bio()
has handled the zone write plug write pointer updates for the targeted
zones, modify blk_zone_wplug_handle_reset_or_finish() to warn if this
flag is set and ignore it.

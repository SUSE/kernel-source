Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86/intel/pmc/arl: Put GNA device in D3

[ Upstream commit ac2d1fd9688fcdfba5acc815fb2b13fec83e5dad ]

As is the case on Meteor Lake, the Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (GNA)
device is powered by BIOS to D0 by default. If no driver is loaded, this
will cause the Package C state to be limited to PC2, leading to
significant power consumption and decrease in batter life.  Put the GNA
device in D3 by default if no driver is loaded for it.

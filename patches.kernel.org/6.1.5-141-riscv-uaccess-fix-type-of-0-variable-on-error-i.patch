Subject: [PATCH] riscv: uaccess: fix type of 0 variable on error in get_user()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.5
Git-commit: b9b916aee6715cd7f3318af6dc360c4729417b94

commit b9b916aee6715cd7f3318af6dc360c4729417b94 upstream.

If the get_user(x, ptr) has x as a pointer, then the setting
of (x) = 0 is going to produce the following sparse warning,
so fix this by forcing the type of 'x' when access_ok() fails.

fs/aio.c:2073:21: warning: Using plain integer as NULL pointer

Subject: [PATCH] of/irq: Disable "interrupt-map" parsing for PASEMI Nemo
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.42
Git-commit: 2cf6b7d15a28640117bf9f75dc050892cf78a6e8

commit 2cf6b7d15a28640117bf9f75dc050892cf78a6e8 upstream.

Once again, we've broken PASEMI Nemo boards with its incomplete
"interrupt-map" translations. Commit 935df1bd40d4 ("of/irq: Factor out
parsing of interrupt-map parent phandle+args from of_irq_parse_raw()")
changed the behavior resulting in the existing work-around not taking
effect. Rework the work-around to just skip parsing "interrupt-map" up
front by using the of_irq_imap_abusers list.

Fixes: 935df1bd40d4 ("of/irq: Factor out parsing of interrupt-map parent phandle+args from of_irq_parse_raw()")

Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: pci_generic: Add mru_default for Foxconn SDX55
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.10
Git-commit: a0572cea8866230ac13da6358c88075f89e99b20

commit a0572cea8866230ac13da6358c88075f89e99b20 upstream.

For default mechanism, product would use default MRU 3500 if
they didn't define it. But for Foxconn SDX55, there is a known
issue which MRU 3500 would lead to data connection lost.
So we align it with Qualcomm default MRU settings.

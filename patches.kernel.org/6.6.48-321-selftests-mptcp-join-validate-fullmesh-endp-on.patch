Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: validate fullmesh endp on 1st sf
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.48
Git-commit: 4878f9f8421f4587bee7b232c1c8a9d3a7d4d782

commit 4878f9f8421f4587bee7b232c1c8a9d3a7d4d782 upstream.

This case was not covered, and the wrong ID was set before the previous
commit.

The rest is not modified, it is just that it will increase the code
coverage.

The right address ID can be verified by looking at the packet traces. We
could automate that using Netfilter with some cBPF code for example, but
that's always a bit cryptic. Packetdrill seems better fitted for that.

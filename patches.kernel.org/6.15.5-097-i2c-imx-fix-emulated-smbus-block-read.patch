Subject: [PATCH] i2c: imx: fix emulated smbus block read
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.5
Git-commit: a5d0b9e32745277644cda8d7d334e7080bd339bf

commit a5d0b9e32745277644cda8d7d334e7080bd339bf upstream.

Acknowledge the byte count submitted by the target.
When I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_DATA read operation is executed by
i2c_smbus_xfer_emulated(), the length of the second (read) message is set
to 1. Length of the block is supposed to be obtained from the target by the
underlying bus driver.
The i2c_imx_isr_read() function should emit the acknowledge on i2c bus
after reading the first byte (i.e., byte count) while processing such
message (as defined in Section 6.5.7 of System Management Bus
Specification [1]). Without this acknowledge, the target does not submit
subsequent bytes and the controller only reads 0xff's.

In addition, store the length of block data obtained from the target in
the buffer provided by i2c_smbus_xfer_emulated() - otherwise the first
byte of actual data is erroneously interpreted as length of the data
block.

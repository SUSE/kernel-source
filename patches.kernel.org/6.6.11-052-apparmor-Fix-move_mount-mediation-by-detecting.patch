Subject: [PATCH] apparmor: Fix move_mount mediation by detecting if source is
 detached
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.11
Git-commit: 8026e40608b4d552216d2a818ca7080a4264bb44

[ Upstream commit 8026e40608b4d552216d2a818ca7080a4264bb44 ]

Prevent move_mount from applying the attach_disconnected flag
to move_mount(). This prevents detached mounts from appearing
as / when applying mount mediation, which is not only incorrect
but could result in bad policy being generated.

Basic mount rules like
  allow mount,
  allow mount options=(move) -> /target/,

will allow detached mounts, allowing older policy to continue
to function. New policy gains the ability to specify `detached` as
a source option
  allow mount detached -> /target/,

In addition make sure support of move_mount is advertised as
a feature to userspace so that applications that generate policy
can respond to the addition.

Note: this fixes mediation of move_mount when a detached mount is used,
      it does not fix the broader regression of apparmor mediation of
      mounts under the new mount api.

Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpu: Enable STIBP on AMD if Automatic IBRS is enabled
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.8
Git-commit: fd470a8beed88440b160d690344fbae05a0b9b1b

commit fd470a8beed88440b160d690344fbae05a0b9b1b upstream.

Unlike Intel's Enhanced IBRS feature, AMD's Automatic IBRS does not
provide protection to processes running at CPL3/user mode, see section
"Extended Feature Enable Register (EFER)" in the APM v2 at
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=304652

Explicitly enable STIBP to protect against cross-thread CPL3
branch target injections on systems with Automatic IBRS enabled.

Also update the relevant documentation.

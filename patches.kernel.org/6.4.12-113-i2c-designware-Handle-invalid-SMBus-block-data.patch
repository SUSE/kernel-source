Subject: [PATCH] i2c: designware: Handle invalid SMBus block data response
 length value
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.12
Git-commit: 69f035c480d76f12bf061148ccfd578e1099e5fc

commit 69f035c480d76f12bf061148ccfd578e1099e5fc upstream.

In the I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_BLOCK_DATA case, the invalid length byte value
(outside of 1-32) of the SMBus block data response from the Slave device
is not correctly handled by the I2C Designware driver.

In case IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN==1, which cannot be detected
from the registers, the Master can be disabled only if the STOP bit
is set. Without STOP bit set, the Master remains active, holding the bus
until receiving a block data response length. This hangs the bus and
is unrecoverable.

Avoid this by issuing another dump read to reach the stop condition when
an invalid length byte is received.

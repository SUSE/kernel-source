Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: sc16is7xx: Add property to change GPIO function
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.2
Git-commit: 4cf478dc5d707e56aefa258c049872eff054a353

commit 4cf478dc5d707e56aefa258c049872eff054a353 upstream.

Some variants in this series of UART controllers have GPIO pins that
are shared between GPIO and modem control lines.

The pin mux mode (GPIO or modem control lines) can be set for each
ports (channels) supported by the variant.

This adds a property to the device tree to set the GPIO pin mux to
modem control lines on selected ports if needed.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6dl: add missing properties for sram
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: f5848b95633d598bacf0500e0108dc5961af88c0

[ Upstream commit f5848b95633d598bacf0500e0108dc5961af88c0 ]

All 3 properties are required by sram.yaml. Fixes the dtbs_check warning:
sram@900000: '#address-cells' is a required property
sram@900000: '#size-cells' is a required property
sram@900000: 'ranges' is a required property

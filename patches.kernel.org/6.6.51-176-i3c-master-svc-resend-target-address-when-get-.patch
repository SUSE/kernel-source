Subject: [PATCH] i3c: master: svc: resend target address when get NACK
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.51
Git-commit: 9bc7501b0b90f4d0c34b97c14ff1f708ce7ad8f3

[ Upstream commit 9bc7501b0b90f4d0c34b97c14ff1f708ce7ad8f3 ]

According to I3C Spec 1.1.1, 11-Jun-2021, section: 5.1.2.2.3:

If the Controller chooses to start an I3C Message with an I3C Dynamic
Address, then special provisions shall be made because that same I3C Target
may be initiating an IBI or a Controller Role Request. So, one of three
things may happen: (skip 1, 2)

3. The Addresses match and the RnW bits also match, and so neither
Controller nor Target will ACK since both are expecting the other side to
provide ACK. As a result, each side might think it had "won" arbitration,
but neither side would continue, as each would subsequently see that the
other did not provide ACK.
...
For either value of RnW: Due to the NACK, the Controller shall defer the
Private Write or Private Read, and should typically transmit the Target
						    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Address again after a Repeated START (i.e., the next one or any one prior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
to a STOP in the Frame). Since the Address Header following a Repeated
START is not arbitrated, the Controller will always win (see Section
5.1.2.2.4).

Resend target address again if address is not 7E and controller get NACK.

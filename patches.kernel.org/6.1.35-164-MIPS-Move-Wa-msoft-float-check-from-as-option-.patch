Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: Move '-Wa,-msoft-float' check from as-option to
 cc-option
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.35
Git-commit: 1d485ddcba85840542f5a4f3b4bbe446dec73309

This patch is for linux-6.1.y and earlier, it has no direct mainline
equivalent.

In order to backport commit d5c8d6e0fa61 ("kbuild: Update assembler
calls to use proper flags and language target") to resolve a separate
issue regarding PowerPC, the problem noticed and fixed by
commit 80a20d2f8288 ("MIPS: Always use -Wa,-msoft-float and eliminate
GAS_HAS_SET_HARDFLOAT") needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, 6.1 and
earlier do not contain commit e4412739472b ("Documentation: raise
minimum supported version of binutils to 2.25"), so it cannot be assumed
that all supported versions of GNU as have support for -msoft-float.

In order to switch from KBUILD_CFLAGS to KBUILD_AFLAGS in as-option
without consequence, move the '-Wa,-msoft-float' check to cc-option,
including '$(cflags-y)' directly to avoid the issue mentioned in
commit 80a20d2f8288 ("MIPS: Always use -Wa,-msoft-float and eliminate
GAS_HAS_SET_HARDFLOAT").

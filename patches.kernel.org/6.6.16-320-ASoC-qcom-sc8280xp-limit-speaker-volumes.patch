Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: qcom: sc8280xp: limit speaker volumes
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.16
Git-commit: c481016bb4f8a9c059c39ac06e7b65e233a61f6a

commit c481016bb4f8a9c059c39ac06e7b65e233a61f6a upstream.

The UCM configuration for the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s has up until now
been setting the speaker PA volume to the minimum -3 dB when enabling
the speakers, but this does not prevent the user from increasing the
volume further.

Limit the digital gain and PA volumes to a combined -3 dB in the machine
driver to reduce the risk of speaker damage until we have active speaker
protection in place (or higher safe levels have been established).

Note that the PA volume limit cannot be set lower than 0 dB or
PulseAudio gets confused when the first 16 levels all map to -3 dB.

Also note that this will probably need to be generalised using
machine-specific limits, but a common limit should do for now.

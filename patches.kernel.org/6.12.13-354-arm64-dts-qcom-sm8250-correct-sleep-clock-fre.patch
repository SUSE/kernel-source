Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: correct sleep clock frequency
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: 75420e437eed69fa95d1d7c339dad86dea35319a

[ Upstream commit 75420e437eed69fa95d1d7c339dad86dea35319a ]

The SM8250 platform uses PM8150 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.

[ Upstream commit d9503be5a100c553731c0e8a82c7b4201e8a970c ]

In terminate_all we should queue up all submitted descriptors to be
freed. We do that for the content of the 'issued' and 'submitted' lists,
but the 'current_tx' descriptor falls through the cracks as it's
removed from the 'issued' list once it gets assigned to be the current
descriptor. Explicitly queue up freeing of the 'current_tx' descriptor
to address a memory leak that is otherwise present.

Subject: [PATCH] lib/generic-radix-tree.c: Fix rare race in
 __genradix_ptr_alloc()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.51
Git-commit: b2f11c6f3e1fc60742673b8675c95b78447f3dae

[ Upstream commit b2f11c6f3e1fc60742673b8675c95b78447f3dae ]

If we need to increase the tree depth, allocate a new node, and then
race with another thread that increased the tree depth before us, we'll
still have a preallocated node that might be used later.

If we then use that node for a new non-root node, it'll still have a
pointer to the old root instead of being zeroed - fix this by zeroing it
in the cmpxchg failure path.

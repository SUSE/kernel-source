Subject: [PATCH] x86/Kconfig: Drop check for -mabi=ms for CONFIG_EFI_STUB
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.6
Git-commit: 33806e7cb8d50379f55c3e8f335e91e1b359dc7b

commit 33806e7cb8d50379f55c3e8f335e91e1b359dc7b upstream.

A recent change in LLVM made CONFIG_EFI_STUB unselectable because it no
longer pretends to support -mabi=ms, breaking the dependency in
Kconfig. Lack of CONFIG_EFI_STUB can prevent kernels from booting via
EFI in certain circumstances.

This check was added by

  8f24f8c2fc82 ("efi/libstub: Annotate firmware routines as __efiapi")

to ensure that __attribute__((ms_abi)) was available, as -mabi=ms is
not actually used in any cflags.

According to the GCC documentation, this attribute has been supported
since GCC 4.4.7. The kernel currently requires GCC 5.1 so this check is
not necessary; even when that change landed in 5.6, the kernel required
GCC 4.9 so it was unnecessary then as well.

Clang supports __attribute__((ms_abi)) for all versions that are
supported for building the kernel so no additional check is needed.
Remove the 'depends on' line altogether to allow CONFIG_EFI_STUB to be
selected when CONFIG_EFI is enabled, regardless of compiler.

Fixes: 8f24f8c2fc82 ("efi/libstub: Annotate firmware routines as __efiapi")

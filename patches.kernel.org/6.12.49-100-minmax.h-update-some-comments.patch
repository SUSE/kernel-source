Subject: [PATCH] minmax.h: update some comments
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.49
Git-commit: 10666e99204818ef45c702469488353b5bb09ec7

[ Upstream commit 10666e99204818ef45c702469488353b5bb09ec7 ]

- Change three to several.
- Remove the comment about retaining constant expressions, no longer true.
- Realign to nearer 80 columns and break on major punctiation.
- Add a leading comment to the block before __signed_type() and __is_nonneg()
  Otherwise the block explaining the cast is a bit 'floating'.
  Reword the rest of that comment to improve readability.

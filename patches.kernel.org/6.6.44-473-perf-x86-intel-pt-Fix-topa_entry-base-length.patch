Subject: [PATCH] perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix topa_entry base length
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.44
Git-commit: 5638bd722a44bbe97c1a7b3fae5b9efddb3e70ff

commit 5638bd722a44bbe97c1a7b3fae5b9efddb3e70ff upstream.

topa_entry->base needs to store a pfn.  It obviously needs to be
large enough to store the largest possible x86 pfn which is
MAXPHYADDR-PAGE_SIZE (52-12).  So it is 4 bits too small.

Increase the size of topa_entry->base from 36 bits to 40 bits.

Note, systems where physical addresses can be 256TiB or more are affected.

[ Adrian: Amend commit message as suggested by Dave Hansen ]

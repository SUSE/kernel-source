Subject: [PATCH] driver core: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in
 dev_uevent()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.26
Git-commit: 18daa52418e7e4629ed1703b64777294209d2622

commit 18daa52418e7e4629ed1703b64777294209d2622 upstream.

If userspace reads "uevent" device attribute at the same time as another
threads unbinds the device from its driver, change to dev->driver from a
valid pointer to NULL may result in crash. Fix this by using READ_ONCE()
when fetching the pointer, and take bus' drivers klist lock to make sure
driver instance will not disappear while we access it.

Use WRITE_ONCE() when setting the driver pointer to ensure there is no
tearing.

Subject: [PATCH] riscv: vmlinux.lds.S: Explicitly handle '.got' section
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.7
Git-commit: e6d1562dd4e9cf8da89edd21c4453893bfe0d4ac

This patch is for linux-6.3.y only, it has no direct mainline
equivalent.

LLVM 17 will now use the GOT for extern weak symbols when using the
medany model, which causes a linker orphan section warning on
linux-6.3.y:

  ld.lld: warning: <internal>:(.got) is being placed in '.got'

This is not an issue in mainline because handling of the .got section
was added by commit 39b33072941f ("riscv: Introduce CONFIG_RELOCATABLE")
and further extended by commit 26e7aacb83df ("riscv: Allow to downgrade
paging mode from the command line") in 6.4-rc1. Neither of these changes
are suitable for stable, so add explicit handling of the .got section in
a standalone change to align 6.3 and mainline, which addresses the
warning.

This is only an issue for 6.3 because commit f4b71bff8d85 ("riscv:
select ARCH_WANT_LD_ORPHAN_WARN for !XIP_KERNEL") landed in 6.3-rc1, so
earlier releases will not see this warning because it will not be
enabled.

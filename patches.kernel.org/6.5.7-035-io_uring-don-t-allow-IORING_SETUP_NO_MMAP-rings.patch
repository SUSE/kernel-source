Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: don't allow IORING_SETUP_NO_MMAP rings on highmem
 pages
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.7
Git-commit: 223ef474316466e9f61f6e0064f3a6fe4923a2c5

commit 223ef474316466e9f61f6e0064f3a6fe4923a2c5 upstream.

On at least arm32, but presumably any arch with highmem, if the
application passes in memory that resides in highmem for the rings,
then we should fail that ring creation. We fail it with -EINVAL, which
is what kernels that don't support IORING_SETUP_NO_MMAP will do as well.

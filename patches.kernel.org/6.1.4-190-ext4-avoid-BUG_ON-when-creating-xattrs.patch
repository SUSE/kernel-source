Subject: [PATCH] ext4: avoid BUG_ON when creating xattrs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.4
Git-commit: b40ebaf63851b3a401b0dc9263843538f64f5ce6

commit b40ebaf63851b3a401b0dc9263843538f64f5ce6 upstream.

Commit fb0a387dcdcd ("ext4: limit block allocations for indirect-block
files to < 2^32") added code to try to allocate xattr block with 32-bit
block number for indirect block based files on the grounds that these
files cannot use larger block numbers. It also added BUG_ON when
allocated block could not fit into 32 bits. This is however bogus
reasoning because xattr block is stored in inode->i_file_acl and
inode->i_file_acl_hi and as such even indirect block based files can
happily use full 48 bits for xattr block number. The proper handling
seems to be there basically since 64-bit block number support was added.
So remove the bogus limitation and BUG_ON.

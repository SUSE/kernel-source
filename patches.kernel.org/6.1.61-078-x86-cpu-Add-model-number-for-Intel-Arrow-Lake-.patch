Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpu: Add model number for Intel Arrow Lake mobile
 processor
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.61
Git-commit: b99d70c0d1380f1368fd4a82271280c4fd28558b

commit b99d70c0d1380f1368fd4a82271280c4fd28558b upstream.

For "reasons" Intel has code-named this CPU with a "_H" suffix.

[ dhansen: As usual, apply this and send it upstream quickly to
	   make it easier for anyone who is doing work that
	   consumes this. ]

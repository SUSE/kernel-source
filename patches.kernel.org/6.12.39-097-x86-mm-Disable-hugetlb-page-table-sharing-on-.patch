Subject: [PATCH] x86/mm: Disable hugetlb page table sharing on 32-bit
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.39
Git-commit: 76303ee8d54bff6d9a6d55997acd88a6c2ba63cf

commit 76303ee8d54bff6d9a6d55997acd88a6c2ba63cf upstream.

Only select ARCH_WANT_HUGE_PMD_SHARE on 64-bit x86.
Page table sharing requires at least three levels because it involves
shared references to PMD tables; 32-bit x86 has either two-level paging
(without PAE) or three-level paging (with PAE), but even with
three-level paging, having a dedicated PGD entry for hugetlb is only
barely possible (because the PGD only has four entries), and it seems
unlikely anyone's actually using PMD sharing on 32-bit.

Having ARCH_WANT_HUGE_PMD_SHARE enabled on non-PAE 32-bit X86 (which
has 2-level paging) became particularly problematic after commit
59d9094df3d7 ("mm: hugetlb: independent PMD page table shared count"),
since that changes `struct ptdesc` such that the `pt_mm` (for PGDs) and
the `pt_share_count` (for PMDs) share the same union storage - and with
2-level paging, PMDs are PGDs.

(For comparison, arm64 also gates ARCH_WANT_HUGE_PMD_SHARE on the
configuration of page tables such that it is never enabled with 2-level
paging.)

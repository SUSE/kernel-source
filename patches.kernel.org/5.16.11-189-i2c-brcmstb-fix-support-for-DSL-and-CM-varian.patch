Subject: [PATCH] i2c: brcmstb: fix support for DSL and CM variants

commit 834cea3a252ed4847db076a769ad9efe06afe2d5 upstream.

DSL and CM (Cable Modem) support 8 B max transfer size and have a custom
DT binding for that reason. This driver was checking for a wrong
"compatible" however which resulted in an incorrect setup.

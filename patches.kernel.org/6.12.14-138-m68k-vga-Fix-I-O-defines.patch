Subject: [PATCH] m68k: vga: Fix I/O defines
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.14
Git-commit: 53036937a101b5faeaf98e7438555fa854a1a844

commit 53036937a101b5faeaf98e7438555fa854a1a844 upstream.

Including m68k's <asm/raw_io.h> in vga.h on nommu platforms results
in conflicting defines with io_no.h for various I/O macros from the
__raw_read and __raw_write families. An example error is

Include <asm/io.h>, which avoids raw_io.h on nommu platforms.
Also change the defined values of some of the read/write symbols in
vga.h to __raw_read/__raw_write as the raw_in/raw_out symbols are not
generally available.

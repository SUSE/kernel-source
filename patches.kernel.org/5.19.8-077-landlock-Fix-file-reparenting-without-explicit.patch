commit 55e55920bbe3ccf516022c51f5527e7d026b8f1d upstream.

This change fixes a mis-handling of the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER right
when multiple rulesets/domains are stacked. The expected behaviour was
that an additional ruleset can only restrict the set of permitted
operations, but in this particular case, it was potentially possible to
re-gain the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER right.

With the introduction of LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER, we added the first
globally denied-by-default access right.  Indeed, this lifted an initial
Landlock limitation to rename and link files, which was initially always
denied when the source or the destination were different directories.

This led to an inconsistent backward compatibility behavior which was
only taken into account if no domain layer were using the new
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER right. However, when restricting a thread with
a new ruleset handling LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER, all inherited parent
rulesets/layers not explicitly handling LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER would
behave as if they were handling this access right and with all their
rules allowing it. This means that renaming and linking files could
became allowed by these parent layers, but all the other required
accesses must also be granted: all layers must allow file removal or
creation, and renaming and linking operations cannot lead to privilege
escalation according to the Landlock policy.  See detailed explanation
in commit b91c3e4ea756 ("landlock: Add support for file reparenting with
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER").

To say it another way, this bug may lift the renaming and linking
limitations of the initial Landlock version, and a same ruleset can
enforce different restrictions depending on previous or next enforced
ruleset (i.e. inconsistent behavior). The LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER right
cannot give access to data not already allowed, but this doesn't follow
the contract of the first Landlock ABI. This fix puts back the
limitation for sandboxes that didn't opt-in for this additional right.

For instance, if a first ruleset allows LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG on
/dst and LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE on /src, renaming /src/file to
/dst/file is denied. However, without this fix, stacking a new ruleset
which allows LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER on / would now permit the
sandboxed thread to rename /src/file to /dst/file .

This change fixes the (absolute) rule access rights, which now always
forbid LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER except when it is explicitly allowed
when creating a rule.

Making all domain handle LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER was an initial
approach but there is two downsides:
* it makes the code more complex because we still want to check that a
  rule allowing LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER is legitimate according to the
  ruleset's handled access rights (i.e. ABI v1 != ABI v2);
* it would not allow to identify if the user created a ruleset
  explicitly handling LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER or not, which will be an
  issue to audit Landlock.

Instead, this change adds an ACCESS_INITIALLY_DENIED list of
denied-by-default rights, which (only) contains
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER.  All domains are treated as if they are also
handling this list, but without modifying their fs_access_masks field.

A side effect is that the errno code returned by rename(2) or link(2)
*may* be changed from EXDEV to EACCES according to the enforced
restrictions.  Indeed, we now have the mechanic to identify if an access
is denied because of a required right (e.g. LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG,
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE) or if it is denied because of missing
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER rights.  This may result in different errno
codes than for the initial Landlock version, but this approach is more
consistent and better for rename/link compatibility reasons, and it
wasn't possible before (hence no backport to ABI v1).  The
layout1.rename_file test reflects this change.

Add 4 layout1.refer_denied_by_default* test suites to check that the
behavior of a ruleset not handling LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER (ABI v1) is
unchanged even if another layer handles LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER (i.e.
ABI v1 precedence).  Make sure rule's absolute access rights are correct
by testing with and without a matching path.  Add test_rename() and
test_exchange() helpers.

Extend layout1.inval tests to check that a denied-by-default access
right is not necessarily part of a domain's handled access rights.

Test coverage for security/landlock is 95.3% of 599 lines according to
gcc/gcov-11.

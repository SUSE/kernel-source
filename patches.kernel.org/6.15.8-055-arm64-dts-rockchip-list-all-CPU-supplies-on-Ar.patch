Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: list all CPU supplies on ArmSoM Sige5
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.8
Git-commit: c76bcc7d1f24e90a2d7b98d1e523d7524269fc56

commit c76bcc7d1f24e90a2d7b98d1e523d7524269fc56 upstream.

List both CPU supply regulators which drive the little and big CPU
clusters, respectively, so that cpufreq can pick them up.

Without this patch the cpufreq governor attempts to raise the big CPU
frequency under high load, while its supply voltage stays at 850000 uV.
This causes system instability and, in my case, random reboots.

With this patch, supply voltages are adjusted in step with frequency
changes from 700000-737000 uV in idle to 950000 uV under full load,
and the system appears to be stable.

While at this, list all CPU supplies for completeness.

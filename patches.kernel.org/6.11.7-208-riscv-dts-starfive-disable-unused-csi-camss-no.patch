Subject: [PATCH] riscv: dts: starfive: disable unused csi/camss nodes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.7
Git-commit: 2e11e78667db90a9e732fbe42820e734d0658fc7

commit 2e11e78667db90a9e732fbe42820e734d0658fc7 upstream.

Aurelien reported probe failures due to the csi node being enabled
without having a camera attached to it. A camera was in the initial
submissions, but was removed from the dts, as it had not actually been
present on the board, but was from an addon board used by the
developer of the relevant drivers. The non-camera pipeline nodes were
not disabled when this happened and the probe failures are problematic
for Debian. Disable them.

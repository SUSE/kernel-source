Subject: [PATCH] net: qrtr: ns: Fix module refcnt
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: fd76e5ccc48f9f54eb44909dd7c0b924005f1582

[ Upstream commit fd76e5ccc48f9f54eb44909dd7c0b924005f1582 ]

The qrtr protocol core logic and the qrtr nameservice are combined into
a single module. Neither the core logic or nameservice provide much
functionality by themselves; combining the two into a single module also
prevents any possible issues that may stem from client modules loading
inbetween qrtr and the ns.

Creating a socket takes two references to the module that owns the
socket protocol. Since the ns needs to create the control socket, this
creates a scenario where there are always two references to the qrtr
module. This prevents the execution of 'rmmod' for qrtr.

To resolve this, forcefully put the module refcount for the socket
opened by the nameservice.

Fixes: a365023a76f2 ("net: qrtr: combine nameservice into main module")

Subject: [PATCH] selftests: use printf instead of echo -ne
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 9e34fad00fc889abbb99d751a4c22cf2bded10df

[ Upstream commit 9e34fad00fc889abbb99d751a4c22cf2bded10df ]

Rather than trying to guess which implementation of "echo" to run with
support for "-ne" options, use "printf" instead of "echo -ne".  It
handles escape characters as a standard feature and it is widespread
among modern shells.

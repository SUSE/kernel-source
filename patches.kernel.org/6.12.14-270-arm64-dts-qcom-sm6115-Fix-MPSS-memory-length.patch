Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm6115: Fix MPSS memory length
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.14
Git-commit: 472d65e7cb591c8379dd6f40561f96be73a46f0f

commit 472d65e7cb591c8379dd6f40561f96be73a46f0f upstream.

The address space in MPSS/Modem PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)
remoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space
(QDSP6...SS_PUB) which has a length of 0x10000.  Value of 0x100 was
copied from older DTS, but it grew since then.

This should have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader
does not use this address space at all.

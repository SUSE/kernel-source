Subject: [PATCH] nvme-fc: release admin tagset if init fails
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.70
Git-commit: d1877cc7270302081a315a81a0ee8331f19f95c8

[ Upstream commit d1877cc7270302081a315a81a0ee8331f19f95c8 ]

nvme_fabrics creates an NVMe/FC controller in following path:

    nvmf_dev_write()
      -> nvmf_create_ctrl()
        -> nvme_fc_create_ctrl()
          -> nvme_fc_init_ctrl()

nvme_fc_init_ctrl() allocates the admin blk-mq resources right after
nvme_add_ctrl() succeeds.  If any of the subsequent steps fail (changing
the controller state, scheduling connect work, etc.), we jump to the
fail_ctrl path, which tears down the controller references but never
frees the admin queue/tag set.  The leaked blk-mq allocations match the
kmemleak report seen during blktests nvme/fc.

Check ctrl->ctrl.admin_tagset in the fail_ctrl path and call
nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() when it is set so that all admin queue
allocations are reclaimed whenever controller setup aborts.

[ Upstream commit d2bd39c0456b75be9dfc7d774b8d021355c26ae3 ]

The PCIe bandwidth controller added by a subsequent commit will require
selecting PCIe Link Speeds that are lower than the Maximum Link Speed.

The struct pci_bus only stores max_bus_speed. Even if PCIe r6.1 sec 8.2.1
currently disallows gaps in supported Link Speeds, the Implementation Note
in PCIe r6.1 sec 7.5.3.18, recommends determining supported Link Speeds
using the Supported Link Speeds Vector in the Link Capabilities 2 Register
(when available) to "avoid software being confused if a future
specification defines Links that do not require support for all slower
speeds."

Reuse code in pcie_get_speed_cap() to add pcie_get_supported_speeds() to
query the Supported Link Speeds Vector of a PCIe device. The value is taken
directly from the Supported Link Speeds Vector or synthesized from the Max
Link Speed in the Link Capabilities Register when the Link Capabilities 2
Register is not available.

The Supported Link Speeds Vector in the Link Capabilities Register 2
corresponds to the bus below on Root Ports and Downstream Ports, whereas it
corresponds to the bus above on Upstream Ports and Endpoints (PCIe r6.1 sec
7.5.3.18):

  Supported Link Speeds Vector - This field indicates the supported Link
  speed(s) of the associated Port.

Add supported_speeds into the struct pci_dev that caches the
Supported Link Speeds Vector.

supported_speeds contains a set of Link Speeds only in the case where PCIe
Link Speed can be determined. Root Complex Integrated Endpoints do not have
a well-defined Link Speed because they do not implement either of the Link
Capabilities Registers, which is allowed by PCIe r6.1 sec 7.5.3 (the same
limitation applies to determining cur_bus_speed and max_bus_speed that are
PCI_SPEED_UNKNOWN in such case). This is of no concern from PCIe bandwidth
controller point of view because such devices are not attached into a PCIe
Root Port that could be controlled.

The supported_speeds field keeps the extra reserved zero at the least
significant bit to match the Link Capabilities 2 Register layout.

An attempt was made to store supported_speeds field into the struct pci_bus
as an intersection of both ends of the Link, however, the subordinate
struct pci_bus is not available early enough. The Target Speed quirk (in
pcie_failed_link_retrain()) can run either during initial scan or later,
requiring it to use the API provided by the PCIe bandwidth controller to
set the Target Link Speed in order to co-exist with the bandwidth
controller. When the Target Speed quirk is calling the bandwidth controller
during initial scan, the struct pci_bus is not yet initialized. As such,
storing supported_speeds into the struct pci_bus is not viable.

Subject: [PATCH] accel/qaic: Mask out SR-IOV PCI resources
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 8685520474bfc0fe4be83c3cbfe3fb3e1ca1514a

[ Upstream commit 8685520474bfc0fe4be83c3cbfe3fb3e1ca1514a ]

During the initialization of the qaic device, pci_select_bars() is
used to fetch a bitmask of the BARs exposed by the device. On devices
that have Virtual Functions capabilities, the bitmask includes SR-IOV
BARs.

Use a mask to filter out SR-IOV BARs if they exist.

Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: disallow self-propelled ring polling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: 7fdbc5f014c3f71bc44673a2d6c5bb2d12d45f25

commit 7fdbc5f014c3f71bc44673a2d6c5bb2d12d45f25 upstream.

When we post a CQE we wake all ring pollers as it normally should be.
However, if a CQE was generated by a multishot poll request targeting
its own ring, it'll wake that request up, which will make it to post
a new CQE, which will wake the request and so on until it exhausts all
CQ entries.

Don't allow multishot polling io_uring files but downgrade them to
oneshots, which was always stated as a correct behaviour that the
userspace should check for.

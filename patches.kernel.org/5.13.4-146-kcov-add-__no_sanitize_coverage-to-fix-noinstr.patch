Subject: [PATCH] kcov: add __no_sanitize_coverage to fix noinstr for all
 architectures
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: 540540d06e9d9b3769b46d88def90f7e7c002322

[ Upstream commit 540540d06e9d9b3769b46d88def90f7e7c002322 ]

Until now no compiler supported an attribute to disable coverage
instrumentation as used by KCOV.

To work around this limitation on x86, noinstr functions have their
coverage instrumentation turned into nops by objtool.  However, this
solution doesn't scale automatically to other architectures, such as
arm64, which are migrating to use the generic entry code.

Clang [1] and GCC [2] have added support for the attribute recently.
[1] https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/280333021e9550d80f5c1152a34e33e81df1e178
[2] https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=cec4d4a6782c9bd8d071839c50a239c49caca689
The changes will appear in Clang 13 and GCC 12.

Add __no_sanitize_coverage for both compilers, and add it to noinstr.

Note: In the Clang case, __has_feature(coverage_sanitizer) is only true if
the feature is enabled, and therefore we do not require an additional
defined(CONFIG_KCOV) (like in the GCC case where __has_attribute(..) is
always true) to avoid adding redundant attributes to functions if KCOV is
off.  That being said, compilers that support the attribute will not
generate errors/warnings if the attribute is redundantly used; however,
where possible let's avoid it as it reduces preprocessed code size and
associated compile-time overheads.

Subject: [PATCH] kheaders: use `command -v` to test for existence of `cpio`
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.4
Git-commit: 6e58e0173507e506a5627741358bc770f220e356

[ Upstream commit 6e58e0173507e506a5627741358bc770f220e356 ]

Commit 13e1df09284d ("kheaders: explicitly validate existence of cpio
command") added an explicit check for `cpio` using `type`.

However, `type` in `dash` (which is used in some popular distributions
and base images as the shell script runner) prints the missing message
to standard output, and thus no error is printed:

    $ bash -c 'type missing >/dev/null'
    bash: line 1: type: missing: not found
    $ dash -c 'type missing >/dev/null'
    $

For instance, this issue may be seen by loongarch builders, given its
defconfig enables CONFIG_IKHEADERS since commit 9cc1df421f00 ("LoongArch:
Update Loongson-3 default config file").

Therefore, use `command -v` instead to have consistent behavior, and
take the chance to provide a more explicit error.

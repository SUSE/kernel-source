Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: marvell10g: fix 88x3310 power up
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.43
Git-commit: c7b75bea853daeb64fc831dbf39a6bbabcc402ac

[ Upstream commit c7b75bea853daeb64fc831dbf39a6bbabcc402ac ]

Clear MV_V2_PORT_CTRL_PWRDOWN bit to set power up for 88x3310 PHY,
it sometimes does not take effect immediately. And a read of this
register causes the bit not to clear. This will cause mv3310_reset()
to time out, which will fail the config initialization. So add a delay
before the next access.

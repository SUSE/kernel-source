Subject: [PATCH] smb: client: increase number of PDUs allowed in a compound
 request
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: 11d4d1dba3315f73d2d1d386f5bf4811a8241d45

[ Upstream commit 11d4d1dba3315f73d2d1d386f5bf4811a8241d45 ]

With the introduction of SMB2_OP_QUERY_WSL_EA, the client may now send
5 commands in a single compound request in order to query xattrs from
potential WSL reparse points, which should be fine as we currently
allow up to 5 PDUs in a single compound request.  However, if
encryption is enabled (e.g. 'seal' mount option) or enforced by the
server, current MAX_COMPOUND(5) won't be enough as we require an extra
PDU for the transform header.

Fix this by increasing MAX_COMPOUND to 7 and, while we're at it, add
an WARN_ON_ONCE() and return -EIO instead of -ENOMEM in case we
attempt to send a compound request that couldn't include the extra
transform header.

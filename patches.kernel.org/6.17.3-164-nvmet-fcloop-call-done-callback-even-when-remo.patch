Subject: [PATCH] nvmet-fcloop: call done callback even when remote port is
 gone
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.3
Git-commit: 10c165af35d225eb033f4edc7fcc699a8d2d533d

[ Upstream commit 10c165af35d225eb033f4edc7fcc699a8d2d533d ]

When the target port is gone, it's not possible to access any of the
request resources. The function should just silently drop the response.
The comment is misleading in this regard.

Though it's still necessary to call the driver via the ->done callback
so the driver is able to release all resources.

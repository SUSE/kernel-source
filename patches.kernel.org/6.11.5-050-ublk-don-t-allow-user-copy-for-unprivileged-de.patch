Subject: [PATCH] ublk: don't allow user copy for unprivileged device
References: bsc#1012628 CVE-2024-50080 bsc#1232502
Patch-mainline: 6.11.5
Git-commit: 42aafd8b48adac1c3b20fe5892b1b91b80c1a1e6

commit 42aafd8b48adac1c3b20fe5892b1b91b80c1a1e6 upstream.

UBLK_F_USER_COPY requires userspace to call write() on ublk char
device for filling request buffer, and unprivileged device can't
be trusted.

So don't allow user copy for unprivileged device.

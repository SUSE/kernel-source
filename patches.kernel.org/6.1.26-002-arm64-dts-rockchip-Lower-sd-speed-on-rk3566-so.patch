Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Lower sd speed on rk3566-soquartz
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.26
Git-commit: 5912b647bd0732ae8c78a6e5b259c82efd177d93

[ Upstream commit 5912b647bd0732ae8c78a6e5b259c82efd177d93 ]

Just like the Quartz64 Model B the previously stated speed of sdr-104
in soquartz is too high for the hardware to reliably communicate with
some fast SD cards.
Especially on some carrierboards.

Lower this to sd-uhs-sdr50 to fix this.

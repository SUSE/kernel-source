Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: fix panic when DSA master device unbinds on
 shutdown
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.10

[ Upstream commit ee534378f00561207656663d93907583958339ae ]

Rafael reports that on a system with LX2160A and Marvell DSA switches,
if a reboot occurs while the DSA master (dpaa2-eth) is up, the following
panic can be seen:

systemd-shutdown[1]: Rebooting.
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00a0000800000041

It can be seen from the stack trace that the problem is that the
deregistration of the master causes a dev_close(), which gets notified
as NETDEV_GOING_DOWN to dsa_slave_netdevice_event().
But dsa_switch_shutdown() has already run, and this has unregistered the
DSA slave interfaces, and yet, the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN handler attempts to
call dev_close_many() on those slave interfaces, leading to the problem.

The previous attempt to avoid the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN on the master after
dsa_switch_shutdown() was called seems improper. Unregistering the slave
interfaces is unnecessary and unhelpful. Instead, after the slaves have
stopped being uppers of the DSA master, we can now reset to NULL the
master->dsa_ptr pointer, which will make DSA start ignoring all future
notifier events on the master.

Fixes: 0650bf52b31f ("net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown")

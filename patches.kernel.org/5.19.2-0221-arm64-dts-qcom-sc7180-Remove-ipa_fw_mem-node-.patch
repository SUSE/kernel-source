Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Remove ipa_fw_mem node on trogdor
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: e60414644cf3a703e10ed4429c15263095945ffe

[ Upstream commit e60414644cf3a703e10ed4429c15263095945ffe ]

We don't use this carveout on trogdor boards, and having it defined in
the sc7180 SoC file causes an overlap message to be printed at boot.

 OF: reserved mem: OVERLAP DETECTED!
 memory@86000000 (0x0000000086000000--0x000000008ec00000) overlaps with memory@8b700000 (0x000000008b700000--0x000000008b710000)

Delete the node in the trogdor dtsi file to fix the overlap problem and
remove the error message.

Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: intel_pstate: Always use HWP_DESIRED_PERF in passive
 mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: 1cefe495cacba5fb0417da3a75a1a76e3546d176

[ Upstream commit 1cefe495cacba5fb0417da3a75a1a76e3546d176 ]

In the passive mode, intel_cpufreq_update_pstate() sets HWP_MIN_PERF in
accordance with the target frequency to ensure delivering adequate
performance, but it sets HWP_DESIRED_PERF to 0, so the processor has no
indication that the desired performance level is actually equal to the
floor one.  This may cause it to choose a performance point way above
the desired level.

Moreover, this is inconsistent with intel_cpufreq_adjust_perf() which
actually sets HWP_DESIRED_PERF in accordance with the target performance
value.

Address this by adjusting intel_cpufreq_update_pstate() to pass
target_pstate as both the minimum and the desired performance levels
to intel_cpufreq_hwp_update().

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6dl-yapp4: Do not allow PM to switch PU
 regulator off on Q/QP

commit 5e67d47d0b010f0704aca469d6d27637b1dcb2ce upstream.

Fix our design flaw in supply voltage distribution on the Quad and QuadPlus
based boards.

The problem is that we supply the SoC cache (VDD_CACHE_CAP) from VDD_PU
instead of VDD_SOC. The VDD_PU internal regulator can be disabled by PM
if VPU or GPU is not used. If that happens the system freezes. To prevent
that configure the reg_pu regulator to be always on.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: drop incorrect EUD port on SoC side
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.2
Git-commit: 39c8af78cbefb8c71a5ad1fa088e761ef418f0a0

[ Upstream commit 39c8af78cbefb8c71a5ad1fa088e761ef418f0a0 ]

Qualcomm Embedded USB Debugger (EUD) second port should point to Type-C
USB connector.  Such connector was defined directly in root node of
sc7280.dtsi which is clearly wrong.  SC7280 is a chip, so physically it
does not have USB Type-C port.  The connector is usually accessible
through some USB switch or controller.

Doug Anderson said that he wasn't ever able to use EUD on Herobrine
boards, probably because of invalid or missing DTS description - DTS is
saying EUD is on usb_2 node, which is connected to a USB Hub, not to the
Type-C port.

Correct the EUD/USB connector topology by removing the top-level fake
USB connector and EUD port pointing to it, and disabling the incomplete
EUD device node.

This fixes also dtbs_check warnings:

  sc7280-herobrine-crd.dtb: connector: ports:port@0: 'reg' is a required property

Subject: [PATCH] ipc/mqueue: use get_tree_nodev() in mqueue_get_tree()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: d60c4d01a98bc1942dba6e3adc02031f5519f94b

[ Upstream commit d60c4d01a98bc1942dba6e3adc02031f5519f94b ]

When running the stress-ng clone benchmark with multiple testing threads,
it was found that there were significant spinlock contention in sget_fc().
The contended spinlock was the sb_lock.  It is under heavy contention
because the following code in the critcal section of sget_fc():

  hlist_for_each_entry(old, &fc->fs_type->fs_supers, s_instances) {
      if (test(old, fc))
          goto share_extant_sb;
  }

After testing with added instrumentation code, it was found that the
benchmark could generate thousands of ipc namespaces with the
corresponding number of entries in the mqueue's fs_supers list where the
namespaces are the key for the search.  This leads to excessive time in
scanning the list for a match.

Looking back at the mqueue calling sequence leading to sget_fc():

  mq_init_ns()
  => mq_create_mount()
  => fc_mount()
  => vfs_get_tree()
  => mqueue_get_tree()
  => get_tree_keyed()
  => vfs_get_super()
  => sget_fc()

Currently, mq_init_ns() is the only mqueue function that will indirectly
call mqueue_get_tree() with a newly allocated ipc namespace as the key for
searching.  As a result, there will never be a match with the exising ipc
namespaces stored in the mqueue's fs_supers list.

So using get_tree_keyed() to do an existing ipc namespace search is just a
waste of time.  Instead, we could use get_tree_nodev() to eliminate the
useless search.  By doing so, we can greatly reduce the sb_lock hold time
and avoid the spinlock contention problem in case a large number of ipc
namespaces are present.

Of course, if the code is modified in the future to allow
mqueue_get_tree() to be called with an existing ipc namespace instead of a
new one, we will have to use get_tree_keyed() in this case.

The following stress-ng clone benchmark command was run on a 2-socket
48-core Intel system:

./stress-ng --clone 32 --verbose --oomable --metrics-brief -t 20

The "bogo ops/s" increased from 5948.45 before patch to 9137.06 after
patch. This is an increase of 54% in performance.

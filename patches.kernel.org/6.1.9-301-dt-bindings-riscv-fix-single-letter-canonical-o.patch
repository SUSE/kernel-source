Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: riscv: fix single letter canonical order
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.9
Git-commit: a943385aa80151c6b2611d3a1cf8338af2b257a1

commit a943385aa80151c6b2611d3a1cf8338af2b257a1 upstream.

I used the wikipedia table for ordering extensions when updating the
pattern here in commit 299824e68bd0 ("dt-bindings: riscv: add new
riscv,isa strings for emulators").

Unfortunately that table did not match canonical order, as defined by
the RISC-V ISA Manual, which defines extension ordering in (what is
currently) Table 41, "Standard ISA extension names". Fix things up by
re-sorting v (vector) and adding p (packed-simd) & j (dynamic
languages). The e (reduced integer) and g (general) extensions are still
intentionally left out.

Subject: [PATCH] bpf: fix order of args in call to bpf_map_kvcalloc
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.41
Git-commit: af253aef183a31ce62d2e39fc520b0ebfb562bb9

[ Upstream commit af253aef183a31ce62d2e39fc520b0ebfb562bb9 ]

The original function call passed size of smap->bucket before the number of
buckets which raises the error 'calloc-transposed-args' on compilation.

Vlastimil Babka added:

The order of parameters can be traced back all the way to 6ac99e8f23d4
("bpf: Introduce bpf sk local storage") accross several refactorings,
and that's why the commit is used as a Fixes: tag.

In v6.10-rc1, a different commit 2c321f3f70bc ("mm: change inlined
allocation helpers to account at the call site") however exposed the
order of args in a way that gcc-14 has enough visibility to start
warning about it, because (in !CONFIG_MEMCG case) bpf_map_kvcalloc is
then a macro alias for kvcalloc instead of a static inline wrapper.

To sum up the warning happens when the following conditions are all met:

- gcc-14 is used (didn't see it with gcc-13)
- commit 2c321f3f70bc is present
- CONFIG_MEMCG is not enabled in .config
- CONFIG_WERROR turns this from a compiler warning to error

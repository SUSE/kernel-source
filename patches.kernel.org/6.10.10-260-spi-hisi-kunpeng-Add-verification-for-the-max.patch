Subject: [PATCH] spi: hisi-kunpeng: Add verification for the max_frequency
 provided by the firmware
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.10
Git-commit: 5127c42c77de18651aa9e8e0a3ced190103b449c

[ Upstream commit 5127c42c77de18651aa9e8e0a3ced190103b449c ]

If the value of max_speed_hz is 0, it may cause a division by zero
error in hisi_calc_effective_speed().
The value of max_speed_hz is provided by firmware.
Firmware is generally considered as a trusted domain. However, as
division by zero errors can cause system failure, for defense measure,
the value of max_speed is validated here. So 0 is regarded as invalid
and an error code is returned.

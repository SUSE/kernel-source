Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath11k: fix Tx power value during active CAC
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.2
Git-commit: 77f1ee6fd8b6e470f721d05a2e269039d5cafcb7

[ Upstream commit 77f1ee6fd8b6e470f721d05a2e269039d5cafcb7 ]

Tx power is fetched from firmware's pdev stats. However, during active
CAC, firmware does not fill the current Tx power and sends the max
initialised value filled during firmware init. If host sends this power
to user space, this is wrong since in certain situations, the Tx power
could be greater than the max allowed by the regulatory. Hence, host
should not be fetching the Tx power during an active CAC.

Fix this issue by returning -EAGAIN error so that user space knows that there's
no valid value available.

Tested-on: QCN9074 hw1.0 PCI WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1-01744-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

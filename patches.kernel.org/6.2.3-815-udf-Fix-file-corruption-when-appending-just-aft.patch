Subject: [PATCH] udf: Fix file corruption when appending just after end of
 preallocated extent
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.3
Git-commit: 36ec52ea038b18a53e198116ef7d7e70c87db046

commit 36ec52ea038b18a53e198116ef7d7e70c87db046 upstream.

When we append new block just after the end of preallocated extent, the
code in inode_getblk() wrongly determined we're going to use the
preallocated extent which resulted in adding block into a wrong logical
offset in the file. Sequence like this manifests it:

xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0x2cacf 0xd122" -c "truncate 0x2dd6f" \
  -c "pwrite 0x27fd9 0x69a9" -c "pwrite 0x32981 0x7244" <file>

The code that determined the use of preallocated extent is actually
stale because udf_do_extend_file() does not create preallocation anymore
so after calling that function we are sure there's no usable
preallocation. Just remove the faulty condition.

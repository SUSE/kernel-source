Subject: [PATCH] mfd: tps65219: Remove TPS65219_REG_TI_DEV_ID check
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 76b58d5111fdcffce615beb71520bc7a6f1742c9

[ Upstream commit 76b58d5111fdcffce615beb71520bc7a6f1742c9 ]

The chipid macro/variable and regmap_read function call is not needed
because the TPS65219_REG_TI_DEV_ID register value is not a consistent value
across TPS65219 PMIC config versions. Reading from the DEV_ID register
without a consistent value to compare it to isn't useful. There isn't a
way to verify the match data ID is the same ID read from the DEV_ID device
register. 0xF0 isn't a DEV_ID value consistent across TPS65219 NVM
configurations.

For TPS65215, there is a consistent value in bits 5-0 of the DEV_ID
register. However, there are other error checks in place within probe()
that apply to both PMICs rather than keeping this isolated check for one
PMIC.

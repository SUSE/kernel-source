Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Remove VHE host restore of CPACR_EL1.SMEN
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.21
Git-commit: 407a99c4654e8ea65393f412c421a55cac539f5b

[ Upstream commit 407a99c4654e8ea65393f412c421a55cac539f5b ]

When KVM is in VHE mode, the host kernel tries to save and restore the
configuration of CPACR_EL1.SMEN (i.e. CPTR_EL2.SMEN when HCR_EL2.E2H=1)
across kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp() and kvm_arch_vcpu_put_fp(), since the
configuration may be clobbered by hyp when running a vCPU. This logic
has historically been broken, and is currently redundant.

This logic was originally introduced in commit:

  861262ab86270206 ("KVM: arm64: Handle SME host state when running guests")

At the time, the VHE hyp code would reset CPTR_EL2.SMEN to 0b00 when
returning to the host, trapping host access to SME state. Unfortunately,
this was unsafe as the host could take a softirq before calling
kvm_arch_vcpu_put_fp(), and if a softirq handler were to use kernel mode
NEON the resulting attempt to save the live FPSIMD/SVE/SME state would
result in a fatal trap.

That issue was limited to VHE mode. For nVHE/hVHE modes, KVM always
saved/restored the host kernel's CPACR_EL1 value, and configured
CPTR_EL2.TSM to 0b0, ensuring that host usage of SME would not be
trapped.

The issue above was incidentally fixed by commit:

  375110ab51dec5dc ("KVM: arm64: Fix resetting SME trap values on reset for (h)VHE")

That commit changed the VHE hyp code to configure CPTR_EL2.SMEN to 0b01
when returning to the host, permitting host kernel usage of SME,
avoiding the issue described above. At the time, this was not identified
as a fix for commit 861262ab86270206.

Now that the host eagerly saves and unbinds its own FPSIMD/SVE/SME
state, there's no need to save/restore the state of the EL0 SME trap.
The kernel can safely save/restore state without trapping, as described
above, and will restore userspace state (including trap controls) before
returning to userspace.

Remove the redundant logic.

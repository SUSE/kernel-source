Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: dma: allwinner,sun50i-a64-dma: Fix min/max typo
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.11
Git-commit: 607a48c78e6b427b0b684d24e61c19e846ad65d6

commit 607a48c78e6b427b0b684d24e61c19e846ad65d6 upstream.

The conditional block for variants with a second clock should have set
minItems, not maxItems, which was already 2. Since clock-names requires
two items, this typo should not have caused any problems.

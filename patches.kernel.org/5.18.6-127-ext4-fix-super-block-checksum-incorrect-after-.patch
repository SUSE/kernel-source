Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix super block checksum incorrect after mount

commit 9b6641dd95a0c441b277dd72ba22fed8d61f76ad upstream.

We got issue as follows:
[home]# mount  /dev/sda  test
EXT4-fs (sda): warning: mounting fs with errors, running e2fsck is recommended
[home]# dmesg
EXT4-fs (sda): warning: mounting fs with errors, running e2fsck is recommended
EXT4-fs (sda): Errors on filesystem, clearing orphan list.
EXT4-fs (sda): recovery complete
EXT4-fs (sda): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Quota mode: none.
[home]# debugfs /dev/sda
debugfs 1.46.5 (30-Dec-2021)
Checksum errors in superblock!  Retrying...

Reason is ext4_orphan_cleanup will reset ‘s_last_orphan’ but not update
super block checksum.

To solve above issue, defer update super block checksum after
ext4_orphan_cleanup.

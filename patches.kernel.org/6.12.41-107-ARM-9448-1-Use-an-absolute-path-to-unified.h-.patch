Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 9448/1: Use an absolute path to unified.h in
 KBUILD_AFLAGS
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.41
Git-commit: 87c4e1459e80bf65066f864c762ef4dc932fad4b

[ Upstream commit 87c4e1459e80bf65066f864c762ef4dc932fad4b ]

After commit d5c8d6e0fa61 ("kbuild: Update assembler calls to use proper
flags and language target"), which updated as-instr to use the
'assembler-with-cpp' language option, the Kbuild version of as-instr
always fails internally for arch/arm with

  <command-line>: fatal error: asm/unified.h: No such file or directory
  compilation terminated.

because '-include' flags are now taken into account by the compiler
driver and as-instr does not have '$(LINUXINCLUDE)', so unified.h is not
found.

This went unnoticed at the time of the Kbuild change because the last
use of as-instr in Kbuild that arch/arm could reach was removed in 5.7
by commit 541ad0150ca4 ("arm: Remove 32bit KVM host support") but a
stable backport of the Kbuild change to before that point exposed this
potential issue if one were to be reintroduced.

Follow the general pattern of '-include' paths throughout the tree and
make unified.h absolute using '$(srctree)' to ensure KBUILD_AFLAGS can
be used independently.

Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5e: Correctly report errors for ethtool rx flows
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.48
Git-commit: cbc796be1779c4dbc9a482c7233995e2a8b6bfb3

[ Upstream commit cbc796be1779c4dbc9a482c7233995e2a8b6bfb3 ]

Previously, an ethtool rx flow with no attrs would not be added to the
NIC as it has no rules to configure the hw with, but it would be
reported as successful to the caller (return code 0). This is confusing
for the user as ethtool then reports "Added rule $num", but no rule was
actually added.

This change corrects that by instead reporting these wrong rules as
-EINVAL.

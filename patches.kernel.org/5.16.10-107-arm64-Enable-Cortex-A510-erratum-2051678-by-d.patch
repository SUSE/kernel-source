Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Enable Cortex-A510 erratum 2051678 by default
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.10
Git-commit: a4b92cebc31d49b7e6ef0ce584c7f2a2e112877d

[ Upstream commit a4b92cebc31d49b7e6ef0ce584c7f2a2e112877d ]

The recently added configuration option for Cortex A510 erratum 2051678 does
not have a "default y" unlike other errata fixes. This appears to simply be
an oversight since the help text suggests enabling the option if unsure and
there's nothing in the commit log to suggest it is intentional.

Subject: [PATCH] drivers/perf: riscv: Reset the counter to hpmevent mapping
 while starting cpus
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.42
Git-commit: 7dd646cf745c34d31e7ed2a52265e9ca8308f58f

[ Upstream commit 7dd646cf745c34d31e7ed2a52265e9ca8308f58f ]

Currently, we stop all the counters while a new cpu is brought online.
However, the hpmevent to counter mappings are not reset. The firmware may
have some stale encoding in their mapping structure which may lead to
undesirable results. We have not encountered such scenario though.

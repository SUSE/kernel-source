Subject: [PATCH] iio: imu: inv_icm42600: Drop redundant pm_runtime
 reinitialization in resume
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.4
Git-commit: a95a0b4e471a6d8860f40c6ac8f1cad9dde3189a

commit a95a0b4e471a6d8860f40c6ac8f1cad9dde3189a upstream.

Remove unnecessary calls to pm_runtime_disable(), pm_runtime_set_active(),
and pm_runtime_enable() from the resume path. These operations are not
required here and can interfere with proper pm_runtime state handling,
especially when resuming from a pm_runtime suspended state.

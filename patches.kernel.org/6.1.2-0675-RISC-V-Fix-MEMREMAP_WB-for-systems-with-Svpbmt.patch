Subject: [PATCH] RISC-V: Fix MEMREMAP_WB for systems with Svpbmt
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: b91676fc16cd384a81e3af52c641aa61985cc231

[ Upstream commit b91676fc16cd384a81e3af52c641aa61985cc231 ]

Currently, the memremap() called with MEMREMAP_WB maps memory using
the generic ioremap() function which breaks on system with Svpbmt
because memory mapped using _PAGE_IOREMAP page attributes is treated
as strongly-ordered non-cacheable IO memory.

To address this, we implement RISC-V specific arch_memremap_wb()
which maps memory using _PAGE_KERNEL page attributes resulting in
write-back cacheable mapping on systems with Svpbmt.

Fixes: ff689fd21cb1 ("riscv: add RISC-V Svpbmt extension support")

Subject: [PATCH] i2c: imx: when being a target, mark the last read as
 processed
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: 87aec499368d488c20292952d6d4be7cb9e49c5e

[ Upstream commit 87aec499368d488c20292952d6d4be7cb9e49c5e ]

When being a target, NAK from the controller means that all bytes have
been transferred. So, the last byte needs also to be marked as
'processed'. Otherwise index registers of backends may not increase.

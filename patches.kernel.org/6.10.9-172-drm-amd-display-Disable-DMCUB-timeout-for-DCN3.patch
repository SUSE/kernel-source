Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.9
Git-commit: 7c70e60fbf4bff1123f0e8d5cb1ae71df6164d7f

[ Upstream commit 7c70e60fbf4bff1123f0e8d5cb1ae71df6164d7f ]

[Why]
DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.

Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which
works fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race
condition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible,
leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register
accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined
state.

[How]
We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, but
for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race
condition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the
risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog
timeout are minimal.

Subject: [PATCH] tcp: fix incorrect undo caused by DSACK of TLP retransmit
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.41
Git-commit: 0ec986ed7bab6801faed1440e8839dcc710331ff

[ Upstream commit 0ec986ed7bab6801faed1440e8839dcc710331ff ]

Loss recovery undo_retrans bookkeeping had a long-standing bug where a
DSACK from a spurious TLP retransmit packet could cause an erroneous
undo of a fast recovery or RTO recovery that repaired a single
really-lost packet (in a sequence range outside that of the TLP
retransmit). Basically, because the loss recovery state machine didn't
account for the fact that it sent a TLP retransmit, the DSACK for the
TLP retransmit could erroneously be implicitly be interpreted as
corresponding to the normal fast recovery or RTO recovery retransmit
that plugged a real hole, thus resulting in an improper undo.

For example, consider the following buggy scenario where there is a
real packet loss but the congestion control response is improperly
undone because of this bug:

+ send packets P1, P2, P3, P4
+ P1 is really lost
+ send TLP retransmit of P4
+ receive SACK for original P2, P3, P4
+ enter fast recovery, fast-retransmit P1, increment undo_retrans to 1
+ receive DSACK for TLP P4, decrement undo_retrans to 0, undo (bug!)
+ receive cumulative ACK for P1-P4 (fast retransmit plugged real hole)

The fix: when we initialize undo machinery in tcp_init_undo(), if
there is a TLP retransmit in flight, then increment tp->undo_retrans
so that we make sure that we receive a DSACK corresponding to the TLP
retransmit, as well as DSACKs for all later normal retransmits, before
triggering a loss recovery undo. Note that we also have to move the
line that clears tp->tlp_high_seq for RTO recovery, so that upon RTO
we remember the tp->tlp_high_seq value until tcp_init_undo() and clear
it only afterward.

Also note that the bug dates back to the original 2013 TLP
implementation, commit 6ba8a3b19e76 ("tcp: Tail loss probe (TLP)").

However, this patch will only compile and work correctly with kernels
that have tp->tlp_retrans, which was added only in v5.8 in 2020 in
commit 76be93fc0702 ("tcp: allow at most one TLP probe per flight").
So we associate this fix with that later commit.

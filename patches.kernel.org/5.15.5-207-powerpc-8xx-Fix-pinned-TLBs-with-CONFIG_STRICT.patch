Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/8xx: Fix pinned TLBs with CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.5
Git-commit: 1e35eba4055149c578baf0318d2f2f89ea3c44a0

commit 1e35eba4055149c578baf0318d2f2f89ea3c44a0 upstream.

As spotted and explained in commit c12ab8dbc492 ("powerpc/8xx: Fix
Oops with STRICT_KERNEL_RWX without DEBUG_RODATA_TEST"), the selection
of STRICT_KERNEL_RWX without selecting DEBUG_RODATA_TEST has spotted
the lack of the DIRTY bit in the pinned kernel data TLBs.

This problem should have been detected a lot earlier if things had
been working as expected. But due to an incredible level of chance or
mishap, this went undetected because of a set of bugs: In fact the
DTLBs were not pinned, because instead of setting the reserve bit
in MD_CTR, it was set in MI_CTR that is the register for ITLBs.

But then, another huge bug was there: the physical address was
reset to 0 at the boundary between RO and RW areas, leading to the
same physical space being mapped at both 0xc0000000 and 0xc8000000.
This had by miracle no consequence until now because the entry was
not really pinned so it was overwritten soon enough to go undetected.

Of course, now that we really pin the DTLBs, it must be fixed as well.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: scrub: try to fix super block errors
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: f9eab5f0bba76742af654f33d517bf62a0db8f12

[ Upstream commit f9eab5f0bba76742af654f33d517bf62a0db8f12 ]

[BUG]
The following script shows that, although scrub can detect super block
errors, it never tries to fix it:

	mkfs.btrfs -f -d raid1 -m raid1 $dev1 $dev2
	xfs_io -c "pwrite 67108864 4k" $dev2

	mount $dev1 $mnt
	btrfs scrub start -B $dev2
	btrfs scrub start -Br $dev2
	umount $mnt

The first scrub reports the super error correctly:

  scrub done for f3289218-abd3-41ac-a630-202f766c0859
  Scrub started:    Tue Aug  2 14:44:11 2022
  Status:           finished
  Duration:         0:00:00
  Total to scrub:   1.26GiB
  Rate:             0.00B/s
  Error summary:    super=1
    Corrected:      0
    Uncorrectable:  0
    Unverified:     0

But the second read-only scrub still reports the same super error:

  Scrub started:    Tue Aug  2 14:44:11 2022
  Status:           finished
  Duration:         0:00:00
  Total to scrub:   1.26GiB
  Rate:             0.00B/s
  Error summary:    super=1
    Corrected:      0
    Uncorrectable:  0
    Unverified:     0

[CAUSE]
The comments already shows that super block can be easily fixed by
committing a transaction:

	/*
	 * If we find an error in a super block, we just report it.
	 * They will get written with the next transaction commit
	 * anyway
	 */

But the truth is, such assumption is not always true, and since scrub
should try to repair every error it found (except for read-only scrub),
we should really actively commit a transaction to fix this.

[FIX]
Just commit a transaction if we found any super block errors, after
everything else is done.

We cannot do this just after scrub_supers(), as
btrfs_commit_transaction() will try to pause and wait for the running
scrub, thus we can not call it with scrub_lock hold.

Subject: [PATCH] dm-integrity: set discard_granularity to logical block size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.6
Git-commit: 69381cf88a8dfa0ab27fb801b78be813e7e8fb80

commit 69381cf88a8dfa0ab27fb801b78be813e7e8fb80 upstream.

dm-integrity could set discard_granularity lower than the logical block
size. This could result in failures when sending discard requests to
dm-integrity.

This fix is needed for kernels prior to 6.10.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Fix CDSP memory length
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: 3de1bf12c6bfb9a92f0803941ecae39b08470446

commit 3de1bf12c6bfb9a92f0803941ecae39b08470446 upstream.

The address space in CDSP PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)
remoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space
(QDSP6...SS_PUB) which has a length of 0x10000.  Value of 0x1400000 was
copied from older DTS, but it does not look accurate at all.

This should have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader
does not use this address space at all.

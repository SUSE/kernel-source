Subject: [PATCH] LoongArch: Return NULL from huge_pte_offset() for invalid PMD
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.26
Git-commit: bd51834d1cf65a2c801295d230c220aeebf87a73

commit bd51834d1cf65a2c801295d230c220aeebf87a73 upstream.

LoongArch's huge_pte_offset() currently returns a pointer to a PMD slot
even if the underlying entry points to invalid_pte_table (indicating no
mapping). Callers like smaps_hugetlb_range() fetch this invalid entry
value (the address of invalid_pte_table) via this pointer.

The generic is_swap_pte() check then incorrectly identifies this address
as a swap entry on LoongArch, because it satisfies the "!pte_present()
&& !pte_none()" conditions. This misinterpretation, combined with a
coincidental match by is_migration_entry() on the address bits, leads to
kernel crashes in pfn_swap_entry_to_page().

Fix this at the architecture level by modifying huge_pte_offset() to
check the PMD entry's content using pmd_none() before returning. If the
entry is invalid (i.e., it points to invalid_pte_table), return NULL
instead of the pointer to the slot.

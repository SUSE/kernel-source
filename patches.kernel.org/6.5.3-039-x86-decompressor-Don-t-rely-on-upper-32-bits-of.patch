Subject: [PATCH] x86/decompressor: Don't rely on upper 32 bits of GPRs being
 preserved
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

[ Upstream commit 264b82fdb4989cf6a44a2bcd0c6ea05e8026b2ac ]

The 4-to-5 level mode switch trampoline disables long mode and paging in
order to be able to flick the LA57 bit. According to section 3.4.1.1 of
the x86 architecture manual [0], 64-bit GPRs might not retain the upper
32 bits of their contents across such a mode switch.

Given that RBP, RBX and RSI are live at this point, preserve them on the
stack, along with the return address that might be above 4G as well.

[0] Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture

  "Because the upper 32 bits of 64-bit general-purpose registers are
   undefined in 32-bit modes, the upper 32 bits of any general-purpose
   register are not preserved when switching from 64-bit mode to a 32-bit
   mode (to protected mode or compatibility mode). Software must not
   depend on these bits to maintain a value after a 64-bit to 32-bit
   mode switch."

Subject: [PATCH] efi/libstub: arm64: Double check image alignment at entry
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.12
Git-commit: c32ac11da3f83bb42b986702a9b92f0a14ed4182

commit c32ac11da3f83bb42b986702a9b92f0a14ed4182 upstream.

On arm64, the stub only moves the kernel image around in memory if
needed, which is typically only for KASLR, given that relocatable
kernels (which is the default) can run from any 64k aligned address,
which is also the minimum alignment communicated to EFI via the PE/COFF
header.

Unfortunately, some loaders appear to ignore this header, and load the
kernel at some arbitrary offset in memory. We can deal with this, but
let's check for this condition anyway, so non-compliant code can be
spotted and fixed.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6ul-pico: Describe the Ethernet PHY clock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.7
Git-commit: d951f8f5f23a9417b7952f22b33784c73caa1ebb

[ Upstream commit d951f8f5f23a9417b7952f22b33784c73caa1ebb ]

Since commit c7e73b5051d6 ("ARM: imx: mach-imx6ul: remove 14x14 EVK
specific PHY fixup")thet Ethernet PHY is no longer configured via code
in board file.

This caused Ethernet to stop working.

Fix this problem by describing the clocks and clock-names to the
Ethernet PHY node so that the KSZ8081 chip can be clocked correctly.

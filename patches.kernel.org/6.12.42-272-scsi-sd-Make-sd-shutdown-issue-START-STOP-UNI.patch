Subject: [PATCH] scsi: sd: Make sd shutdown issue START STOP UNIT
 appropriately
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.42
Git-commit: 8e48727c26c4d839ff9b4b73d1cae486bea7fe19

[ Upstream commit 8e48727c26c4d839ff9b4b73d1cae486bea7fe19 ]

Commit aa3998dbeb3a ("ata: libata-scsi: Disable scsi device
manage_system_start_stop") enabled libata EH to manage device power mode
trasitions for system suspend/resume and removed the flag from
ata_scsi_dev_config. However, since the sd_shutdown() function still
relies on the manage_system_start_stop flag, a spin-down command is not
issued to the disk with command "echo 1 > /sys/block/sdb/device/delete"

sd_shutdown() can be called for both system/runtime start stop
operations, so utilize the manage_run_time_start_stop flag set in the
ata_scsi_dev_config and issue a spin-down command during disk removal
when the system is running. This is in addition to when the system is
powering off and manage_shutdown flag is set. The
manage_system_start_stop flag will still be used for drivers that still
set the flag.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/panel-edp: Fix delays for Innolux N116BCA-EA1
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.11
Git-commit: 8f7115c1923cd11146525f1615beb29018001964

[ Upstream commit 8f7115c1923cd11146525f1615beb29018001964 ]

Commit 52824ca4502d ("drm/panel-edp: Better describe eDP panel delays")
clarified the various delays used for eDP panels, tying them to the eDP
panel timing diagram.

For Innolux N116BCA-EA1, .prepare_to_enable would be:

    t4_min + t5_min + t6_min + max(t7_max, t8_min)

Since t4_min and t5_min are both 0, the panel can use either .enable or
.prepare_to_enable.

As .enable is better defined, switch to using .enable for this panel.

Also add .disable = 50, based on the datasheet's t9_min value. This
effectively makes the delays the same as delay_200_500_e80_d50.

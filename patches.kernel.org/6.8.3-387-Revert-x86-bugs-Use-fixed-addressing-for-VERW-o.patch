Subject: [PATCH] Revert "x86/bugs: Use fixed addressing for VERW operand"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: 532a0c57d7ff75e8f07d4e25cba4184989e2a241

commit 532a0c57d7ff75e8f07d4e25cba4184989e2a241 upstream.

This was reverts commit 8009479ee919b9a91674f48050ccbff64eafedaa.

It was originally in x86/urgent, but was deemed wrong so got zapped.
But in the meantime, x86/urgent had been merged into x86/apic to
resolve a conflict.  I didn't notice the merge so didn't zap it
from x86/apic and it managed to make it up with the x86/apic
material.

The reverted commit is known to cause some KASAN problems.

Subject: [PATCH] x86/pkey: Fix undefined behaviour with PKRU_WD_BIT
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.12
Git-commit: 57690554abe135fee81d6ac33cc94d75a7e224bb

commit 57690554abe135fee81d6ac33cc94d75a7e224bb upstream.

Both __pkru_allows_write() and arch_set_user_pkey_access() shift
PKRU_WD_BIT (a signed constant) by up to 30 bits, hitting the
sign bit.

Use unsigned constants instead.

Clearly pkey 15 has not been used in combination with UBSAN yet.

Noticed by code inspection only.  I can't actually provoke the
compiler into generating incorrect logic as far as this shift is
concerned.

[
  dhansen: add stable@ tag, plus minor changelog massaging,

           For anyone doing backports, these #defines were in
	   arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable.h before 784a46618f6.

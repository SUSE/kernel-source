Subject: [PATCH] quota: flush quota_release_work upon quota writeback
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.4
Git-commit: ac6f420291b3fee1113f21d612fa88b628afab5b

[ Upstream commit ac6f420291b3fee1113f21d612fa88b628afab5b ]

One of the paths quota writeback is called from is:

freeze_super()
  sync_filesystem()
    ext4_sync_fs()
      dquot_writeback_dquots()

Since we currently don't always flush the quota_release_work queue in
this path, we can end up with the following race:

 1. dquot are added to releasing_dquots list during regular operations.
 2. FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_work queue.
 3. Freeze completes.
 4. Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which
    hits a WARN_ON since transaction gets started during frozen state:

  ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110 [ext4] (unreliable)
  __ext4_journal_start_sb+0x64/0x1c0 [ext4]
  ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0 [ext4]
  quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0

Which is the following line:

  WARN_ON(sb->s_writers.frozen == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);

Which ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesg
noise. This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.

To avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue during
dquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems after
freeze.

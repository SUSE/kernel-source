Subject: [PATCH] x86/microcode: Update the Intel processor flag scan check
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 7e6b0a2e4152f4046af95eeb46f8b4f9b2a7398d

[ Upstream commit 7e6b0a2e4152f4046af95eeb46f8b4f9b2a7398d ]

The Family model check to read the processor flag MSR is misleading and
potentially incorrect. It doesn't consider Family while comparing the
model number. The original check did have a Family number but it got
lost/moved during refactoring.

intel_collect_cpu_info() is called through multiple paths such as early
initialization, CPU hotplug as well as IFS image load. Some of these
flows would be error prone due to the ambiguous check.

Correct the processor flag scan check to use a Family number and update
it to a VFM based one to make it more readable.

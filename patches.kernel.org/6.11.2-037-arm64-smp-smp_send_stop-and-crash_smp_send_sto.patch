Subject: [PATCH] arm64: smp: smp_send_stop() and crash_smp_send_stop() should

[ Upstream commit fdfa588124b6356cd08e5d3f0c3643c4ec3d6887 ]

When testing hard lockup handling on my sc7180-trogdor-lazor device
with pseudo-NMI enabled, with serial console enabled and with kgdb
disabled, I found that the stack crawls printed to the serial console
ended up as a jumbled mess. After rebooting, the pstore-based console
looked fine though. Also, enabling kgdb to trap the panic made the
console look fine and avoided the mess.

After a bit of tracking down, I came to the conclusion that this was
what was happening:
1. The panic path was stopping all other CPUs with
   panic_other_cpus_shutdown().
2. At least one of those other CPUs was in the middle of printing to
   the serial console and holding the console port's lock, which is
   grabbed with "irqsave". ...but since we were stopping with an NMI
   we didn't care about the "irqsave" and interrupted anyway.
3. Since we stopped the CPU while it was holding the lock it would
   never release it.
4. All future calls to output to the console would end up failing to
   get the lock in qcom_geni_serial_console_write(). This isn't
   _totally_ unexpected at panic time but it's a code path that's not
   well tested, hard to get right, and apparently doesn't work
   terribly well on the Qualcomm geni serial driver.

The Qualcomm geni serial driver was fixed to be a bit better in commit
9e957a155005 ("serial: qcom-geni: Don't cancel/abort if we can't get
the port lock") but it's nice not to get into this situation in the
first place.

Taking a page from what x86 appears to do in native_stop_other_cpus(),
do this:
1. First, try to stop other CPUs with a normal IPI and wait a second.
   This gives them a chance to leave critical sections.
2. If CPUs fail to stop then retry with an NMI, but give a much lower
   timeout since there's no good reason for a CPU not to react quickly
   to a NMI.

This works well and avoids the corrupted console and (presumably)
could help avoid other similar issues.

In order to do this, we need to do a little re-organization of our
IPIs since we don't have any more free IDs. Do what was suggested in
previous conversations and combine "stop" and "crash stop". That frees
up an IPI so now we can have a "stop" and "stop NMI".

In order to do this we also need a slight change in the way we keep
track of which CPUs still need to be stopped. We need to know
specifically which CPUs haven't stopped yet when we fall back to NMI
but in the "crash stop" case the "cpu_online_mask" isn't updated as
CPUs go down. This is why that code path had an atomic of the number
of CPUs left. Solve this by also updating the "cpu_online_mask" for
crash stops.

All of the above lets us combine the logic for "stop" and "crash stop"
code, which appeared to have a bunch of arbitrary implementation
differences.

Aside from the above change where we try a normal IPI and then an NMI,
the combined function has a few subtle differences:
* In the normal smp_send_stop(), if we fail to stop one or more CPUs
  then we won't include the current CPU (the one running
  smp_send_stop()) in the error message.
* In crash_smp_send_stop(), if we fail to stop some CPUs we'll print
  the CPUs that we failed to stop instead of printing all _but_ the
  current running CPU.
* In crash_smp_send_stop(), we will now only print "SMP: stopping
  secondary CPUs" if (system_state <= SYSTEM_RUNNING).

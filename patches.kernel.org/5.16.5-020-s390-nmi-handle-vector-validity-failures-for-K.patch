Subject: [PATCH] s390/nmi: handle vector validity failures for KVM guests
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.5
Git-commit: f094a39c6ba168f2df1edfd1731cca377af5f442

commit f094a39c6ba168f2df1edfd1731cca377af5f442 upstream.

The machine check validity bit tells about the context. If a KVM guest
was running the bit tells about the guest validity and the host state is
not affected. As a guest can disable the guest validity this might
result in unwanted host errors on machine checks.

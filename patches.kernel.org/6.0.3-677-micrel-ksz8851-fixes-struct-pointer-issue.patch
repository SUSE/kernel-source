Subject: [PATCH] micrel: ksz8851: fixes struct pointer issue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: fef5de753ff01887cfa50990532c3890fccb9338

[ Upstream commit fef5de753ff01887cfa50990532c3890fccb9338 ]

Issue found during code review. This bug has no impact as long as the
ks8851_net structure is the first element of the ks8851_net_spi structure.
As long as the offset to the ks8851_net struct is zero, the container_of()
macro is subtracting 0 and therefore no damage done. But if the
ks8851_net_spi struct is ever modified such that the ks8851_net struct
within it is no longer the first element of the struct, then the bug would
manifest itself and cause problems.

struct ks8851_net is contained within ks8851_net_spi.
ks is contained within kss.
kss is the priv_data of the netdev structure.

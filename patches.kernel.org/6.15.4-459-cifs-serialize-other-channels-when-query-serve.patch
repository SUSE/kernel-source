Subject: [PATCH] cifs: serialize other channels when query server interfaces
 is pending
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: b5e3e6e28cf3853566ba5d816f79aba5be579158

commit b5e3e6e28cf3853566ba5d816f79aba5be579158 upstream.

Today, during smb2_reconnect, session_mutex is released as soon as
the tcon is reconnected and is in a good state. However, in case
multichannel is enabled, there is also a query of server interfaces that
follows. We've seen that this query can race with reconnects of other
channels, causing them to step on each other with reconnects.

This change extends the hold of session_mutex till after the query of
server interfaces is complete. In order to avoid recursive smb2_reconnect
checks during query ioctl, this change also introduces a session flag
for sessions where such a query is in progress.

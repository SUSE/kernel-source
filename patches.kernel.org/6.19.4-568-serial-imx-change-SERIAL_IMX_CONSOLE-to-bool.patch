Subject: [PATCH] serial: imx: change SERIAL_IMX_CONSOLE to bool
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: 79527d86ba91c2d9354832d19fd12b3baa66bd10

[ Upstream commit 79527d86ba91c2d9354832d19fd12b3baa66bd10 ]

SERIAL_IMX_CONSOLE is a build option for the imx driver (SERIAL_IMX).
It does not build a separate console driver file, so it can't be built
as a module since it isn't built at all.

Change the Kconfig symbol from tristate to bool and update the help
text accordingly.

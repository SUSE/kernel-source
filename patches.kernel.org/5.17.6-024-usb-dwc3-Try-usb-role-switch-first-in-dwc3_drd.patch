Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: Try usb-role-switch first in dwc3_drd_init
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.6
Git-commit: ab7aa2866d295438dc60522f85c5421c6b4f1507

commit ab7aa2866d295438dc60522f85c5421c6b4f1507 upstream.

If the PHY controller node has a "port" dwc3 tries to find an
extcon device even when "usb-role-switch" is present. This happens
because dwc3_get_extcon() sees that "port" node and then calls
extcon_find_edev_by_node() which will always return EPROBE_DEFER
in that case.

On the other hand, even if an extcon was present and dwc3_get_extcon()
was successful it would still be ignored in favor of "usb-role-switch".

Let's just first check if "usb-role-switch" is configured in the device
tree and directly use it instead and only try to look for an extcon
device otherwise.

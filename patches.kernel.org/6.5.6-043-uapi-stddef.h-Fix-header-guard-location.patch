Subject: [PATCH] uapi: stddef.h: Fix header guard location
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: 531108ec5b5cd45ec6272a6115e73275baef7d22

[ Upstream commit 531108ec5b5cd45ec6272a6115e73275baef7d22 ]

The #endif for the header guard wasn't at the end of the header. This
was harmless since the define that escaped was already testing for its
own redefinition. Regardless, move the #endif to the correct place.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: fix display port phy reg property
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: 425f30cc843c727bc7753a0d33710d1e4a999168

[ Upstream commit 425f30cc843c727bc7753a0d33710d1e4a999168 ]

Existing display port phy reg property is derived from usb phy which
map display port phy pcs to wrong address which cause aux init
with wrong address and prevent both dpcd read and write from working.
Fix this problem by assigning correct pcs address to display port
phy reg property.

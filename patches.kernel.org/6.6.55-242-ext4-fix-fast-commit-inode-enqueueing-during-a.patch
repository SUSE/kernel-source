Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix fast commit inode enqueueing during a full journal
 commit
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.55
Git-commit: 6db3c1575a750fd417a70e0178bdf6efa0dd5037

commit 6db3c1575a750fd417a70e0178bdf6efa0dd5037 upstream.

When a full journal commit is on-going, any fast commit has to be enqueued
into a different queue: FC_Q_STAGING instead of FC_Q_MAIN.  This enqueueing
is done only once, i.e. if an inode is already queued in a previous fast
commit entry it won't be enqueued again.  However, if a full commit starts
_after_ the inode is enqueued into FC_Q_MAIN, the next fast commit needs to
be done into FC_Q_STAGING.  And this is not being done in function
ext4_fc_track_template().

This patch fixes the issue by re-enqueuing an inode into the STAGING queue
during the fast commit clean-up callback when doing a full commit.  However,
to prevent a race with a fast-commit, the clean-up callback has to be called
with the journal locked.

This bug was found using fstest generic/047.  This test creates several 32k
bytes files, sync'ing each of them after it's creation, and then shutting
down the filesystem.  Some data may be loss in this operation; for example a
file may have it's size truncated to zero.

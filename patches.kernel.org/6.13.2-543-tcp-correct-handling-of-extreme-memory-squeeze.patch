[ Upstream commit 8c670bdfa58e48abad1d5b6ca1ee843ca91f7303 ]

Testing with iperf3 using the "pasta" protocol splicer has revealed
a problem in the way tcp handles window advertising in extreme memory
squeeze situations.

Under memory pressure, a socket endpoint may temporarily advertise
a zero-sized window, but this is not stored as part of the socket data.
The reasoning behind this is that it is considered a temporary setting
which shouldn't influence any further calculations.

However, if we happen to stall at an unfortunate value of the current
window size, the algorithm selecting a new value will consistently fail
to advertise a non-zero window once we have freed up enough memory.
This means that this side's notion of the current window size is
different from the one last advertised to the peer, causing the latter
to not send any data to resolve the sitution.

The problem occurs on the iperf3 server side, and the socket in question
is a completely regular socket with the default settings for the
fedora40 kernel. We do not use SO_PEEK or SO_RCVBUF on the socket.

The following excerpt of a logging session, with own comments added,
shows more in detail what is happening:

// The receive queue is empty, but no new advertisement has been sent.
// The peer still thinks the receive window is zero, and sends nothing.
// We have ended up in a deadlock situation.

Note that well behaved endpoints will send win0 probes, so the problem
will not occur.

Furthermore, we have observed that in these situations this side may
send out an updated 'th->ack_seqÂ´ which is not stored in tp->rcv_wup
as it should be. Backing ack_seq seems to be harmless, but is of
course still wrong from a protocol viewpoint.

We fix this by updating the socket state correctly when a packet has
been dropped because of memory exhaustion and we have to advertize
a zero window.

Further testing shows that the connection recovers neatly from the
squeeze situation, and traffic can continue indefinitely.

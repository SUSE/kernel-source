[ Upstream commit a3a4be32b69c99fc20a66e0de83b91f8c882bf4c ]

This commit fixes a typo introduced in commit
ee368a10d0df ("ARM: dts: am335x-boneblack.dts: unique gpio-line-names").
gpio0_7 is located on the P9 header on the BBB.
This was verified with a BeagleBone Black by toggling the pin and
checking with a multimeter that it corresponds to pin 42 on the P9
header.

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix mute LED mask on HP OMEN 16 laptop
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.41
Git-commit: 931837cd924048ab785eedb4cee5b276c90a2924

[ Upstream commit 931837cd924048ab785eedb4cee5b276c90a2924 ]

this patch is to fix my previous Commit <e5182305a519> i have fixed mute
led but for by This patch corrects the coefficient mask value introduced
in commit <e5182305a519>, which was intended to enable the mute LED
functionality. During testing, multiple values were evaluated, and
an incorrect value was mistakenly included in the final commit.
This update fixes that error by applying the correct mask value for
proper mute LED behavior.

Tested on 6.15.5-arch1-1

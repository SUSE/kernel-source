Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8186-corsola: Fix IT6505 reset line
 polarity
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.4
Git-commit: fbcc95fceb6d179dd150df2dc613dfd9b013052c

commit fbcc95fceb6d179dd150df2dc613dfd9b013052c upstream.

The reset line of the IT6505 bridge chip is active low, not active high.
It was incorrectly inverted in the device tree as the implementation at
the time incorrectly inverted the polarity in its driver, due to a prior
device having an inline inverting level shifter.

Fix the polarity now while the external display pipeline is incomplete,
thereby avoiding any impact to running systems.

A matching fix for the driver should be included if this change is
backported.

Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: felix: fix taprio guard band overflow at 10Mbps
 with jumbo frames
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.9
Git-commit: 6ac7a27a8b07588497ed53dfd885df9c72bc67e0

[ Upstream commit 6ac7a27a8b07588497ed53dfd885df9c72bc67e0 ]

The DEV_MAC_MAXLEN_CFG register contains a 16-bit value - up to 65535.
Plus 2 * VLAN_HLEN (4), that is up to 65543.

The picos_per_byte variable is the largest when "speed" is lowest -
SPEED_10 = 10. In that case it is (1000000L * 8) / 10 = 800000.

Their product - 52434400000 - exceeds 32 bits, which is a problem,
because apparently, a multiplication between two 32-bit factors is
evaluated as 32-bit before being assigned to a 64-bit variable.
In fact it's a problem for any MTU value larger than 5368.

Cast one of the factors of the multiplication to u64 to force the
multiplication to take place on 64 bits.

Issue found by Coverity.

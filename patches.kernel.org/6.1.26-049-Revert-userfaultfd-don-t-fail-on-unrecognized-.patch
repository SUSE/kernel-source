Subject: [PATCH] Revert "userfaultfd: don't fail on unrecognized features"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.26
Git-commit: 2ff559f31a5d50c31a3f9d849f8af90dc36c7105

commit 2ff559f31a5d50c31a3f9d849f8af90dc36c7105 upstream.

This is a proposal to revert commit 914eedcb9ba0ff53c33808.

I found this when writing a simple UFFDIO_API test to be the first unit
test in this set.  Two things breaks with the commit:

  - UFFDIO_API check was lost and missing.  According to man page, the
  kernel should reject ioctl(UFFDIO_API) if uffdio_api.api != 0xaa.  This
  check is needed if the api version will be extended in the future, or
  user app won't be able to identify which is a new kernel.

  - Feature flags checks were removed, which means UFFDIO_API with a
  feature that does not exist will also succeed.  According to the man
  page, we should (and it makes sense) to reject ioctl(UFFDIO_API) if
  unknown features passed in.

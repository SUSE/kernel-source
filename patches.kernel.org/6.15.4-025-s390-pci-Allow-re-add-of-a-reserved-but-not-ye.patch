Subject: [PATCH] s390/pci: Allow re-add of a reserved but not yet removed
 device
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: 4b1815a52d7eb03b3e0e6742c6728bc16a4b2d1d

commit 4b1815a52d7eb03b3e0e6742c6728bc16a4b2d1d upstream.

The architecture assumes that PCI functions can be removed synchronously
as PCI events are processed. This however clashes with the reference
counting of struct pci_dev which allows device drivers to hold on to a
struct pci_dev reference even as the underlying device is removed. To
bridge this gap commit 2a671f77ee49 ("s390/pci: fix use after free of
zpci_dev") keeps the struct zpci_dev in ZPCI_FN_STATE_RESERVED state
until common code releases the struct pci_dev. Only when all references
are dropped, the struct zpci_dev can be removed and freed.

Later commit a46044a92add ("s390/pci: fix zpci_zdev_put() on reserve")
moved the deletion of the struct zpci_dev from the zpci_list in
zpci_release_device() to the point where the device is reserved. This
was done to prevent handling events for a device that is already being
removed, e.g. when the platform generates both PCI event codes 0x304
and 0x308. In retrospect, deletion from the zpci_list in the release
function without holding the zpci_list_lock was also racy.

A side effect of this handling is that if the underlying device
re-appears while the struct zpci_dev is in the ZPCI_FN_STATE_RESERVED
state, the new and old instances of the struct zpci_dev and/or struct
pci_dev may clash. For example when trying to create the IOMMU sysfs
files for the new instance. In this case, re-adding the new instance is
aborted. The old instance is removed, and the device will remain absent
until the platform issues another event.

Fix this by allowing the struct zpci_dev to be brought back up right
until it is finally removed. To this end also keep the struct zpci_dev
in the zpci_list until it is finally released when all references have
been dropped.

Deletion from the zpci_list from within the release function is made
safe by using kref_put_lock() with the zpci_list_lock. This ensures that
the releasing code holds the last reference.

Subject: [PATCH] x86/pci: Skip early E820 check for ECAM region
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.33
Git-commit: 199f968f1484a14024d0d467211ffc2faf193eb4

commit 199f968f1484a14024d0d467211ffc2faf193eb4 upstream.

Arul, Mateusz, Imcarneiro91, and Aman reported a regression caused by
07eab0901ede ("efi/x86: Remove EfiMemoryMappedIO from E820 map").  On the
Lenovo Legion 9i laptop, that commit removes the ECAM area from E820, which
means the early E820 validation fails, which means we don't enable ECAM in
the "early MCFG" path.

The static MCFG table describes ECAM without depending on the ACPI
interpreter.  Many Legion 9i ACPI methods rely on that, so they fail when
PCI config access isn't available, resulting in the embedded controller,
PS/2, audio, trackpad, and battery devices not being detected.  The _OSC
method also fails, so Linux can't take control of the PCIe hotplug, PME,
and AER features:

  # pci_mmcfg_early_init()

  PCI: ECAM [mem 0xc0000000-0xce0fffff] (base 0xc0000000) for domain 0000 [bus 00-e0]

  # pci_mmcfg_late_init()

  PCI: ECAM [mem 0xc0000000-0xce0fffff] (base 0xc0000000) for domain 0000 [bus 00-e0]
  PCI: [Firmware Info]: ECAM [mem 0xc0000000-0xce0fffff] not reserved in ACPI motherboard resources
  PCI: ECAM [mem 0xc0000000-0xce0fffff] is EfiMemoryMappedIO; assuming valid
  PCI: ECAM [mem 0xc0000000-0xce0fffff] reserved to work around lack of ACPI motherboard _CRS

Per PCI Firmware r3.3, sec 4.1.2, ECAM space must be reserved by a PNP0C02
resource, but there's no requirement to mention it in E820, so we shouldn't
look at E820 to validate the ECAM space described by MCFG.

In 2006, 946f2ee5c731 ("[PATCH] i386/x86-64: Check that MCFG points to an
e820 reserved area") added a sanity check of E820 to work around buggy MCFG
tables, but that over-aggressive validation causes failures like this one.

Keep the E820 validation check for machines older than 2016, an arbitrary
ten years after 946f2ee5c731, so machines that depend on it don't break.

Skip the early E820 check for 2016 and newer BIOSes since there's no
requirement to describe ECAM in E820.

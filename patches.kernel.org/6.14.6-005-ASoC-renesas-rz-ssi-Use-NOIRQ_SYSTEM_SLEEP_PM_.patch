Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: renesas: rz-ssi: Use NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.6
Git-commit: c1b0f5183a4488b6b7790f834ce3a786725b3583

commit c1b0f5183a4488b6b7790f834ce3a786725b3583 upstream.

In the latest kernel versions system crashes were noticed occasionally
during suspend/resume. This occurs because the RZ SSI suspend trigger
(called from snd_soc_suspend()) is executed after rz_ssi_pm_ops->suspend()
and it accesses IP registers. After the rz_ssi_pm_ops->suspend() is
executed the IP clocks are disabled and its reset line is asserted.

Since snd_soc_suspend() is invoked through snd_soc_pm_ops->suspend(),
snd_soc_pm_ops is associated with soc_driver (defined in
sound/soc/soc-core.c), and there is no parent-child relationship between
soc_driver and rz_ssi_driver the power management subsystem does not
enforce a specific suspend/resume order between the RZ SSI platform driver
and soc_driver.

To ensure that the suspend/resume function of rz-ssi is executed after
snd_soc_suspend(), use NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS().

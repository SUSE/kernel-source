Subject: [PATCH] perf/arm: Add missing .suppress_bind_attrs
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.43
Git-commit: 860a831de138a7ad6bc86019adaf10eb84c02655

[ Upstream commit 860a831de138a7ad6bc86019adaf10eb84c02655 ]

PMU drivers should set .suppress_bind_attrs so that userspace is denied
the opportunity to pull the driver out from underneath an in-use PMU
(with predictably unpleasant consequences). Somehow both the CMN and NI
drivers have managed to miss this; put that right.

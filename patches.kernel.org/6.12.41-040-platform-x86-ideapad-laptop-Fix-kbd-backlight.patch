Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Fix kbd backlight not

commit e10981075adce203eac0be866389309eeb8ef11e upstream.

On some models supported by ideapad-laptop, the HW/FW can remember the
state of keyboard backlight among boots. However, it is always turned
off while shutting down, as a side effect of the LED class device
unregistering sequence.

This is inconvenient for users who always prefer turning on the
keyboard backlight. Thus, set LED_RETAIN_AT_SHUTDOWN on the LED class
device so that the state of keyboard backlight gets remembered, which
also aligns with the behavior of manufacturer utilities on Windows.

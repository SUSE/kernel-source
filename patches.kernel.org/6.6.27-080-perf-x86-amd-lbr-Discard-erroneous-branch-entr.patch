Subject: [PATCH] perf/x86/amd/lbr: Discard erroneous branch entries
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.27
Git-commit: 29297ffffb0bf388778bd4b581a43cee6929ae65

[ Upstream commit 29297ffffb0bf388778bd4b581a43cee6929ae65 ]

The Revision Guide for AMD Family 19h Model 10-1Fh processors declares
Erratum 1452 which states that non-branch entries may erroneously be
recorded in the Last Branch Record (LBR) stack with the valid and
spec bits set.

Such entries can be recognized by inspecting bit 61 of the corresponding
LastBranchStackToIp register. This bit is currently reserved but if found
to be set, the associated branch entry should be discarded.

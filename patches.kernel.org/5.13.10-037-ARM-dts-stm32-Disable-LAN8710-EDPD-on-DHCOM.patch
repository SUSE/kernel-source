Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: Disable LAN8710 EDPD on DHCOM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.10
Git-commit: 36862c1ebc92a7e6fcc55002965c44b8ad17d4ca

[ Upstream commit 36862c1ebc92a7e6fcc55002965c44b8ad17d4ca ]

The LAN8710 Energy Detect Power Down (EDPD) functionality might cause
unreliable cable detection. There are multiple accounts of this in the
SMSC PHY driver patches which attempted to make EDPD reliable, however
it seems there is always some sort of corner case left. Unfortunatelly,
there is no errata documented which would confirm this to be a silicon
bug on the LAN87xx series of PHYs (LAN8700, LAN8710, LAN8720 at least).

Disable EDPD on the DHCOM SoM, just like multiple other boards already
do as well, to make the cable detection reliable.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: renesas: r9a09g011: Fix unit address format error
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 278f5015a3deaa2ea0db6070bbc2a8edf2455643

[ Upstream commit 278f5015a3deaa2ea0db6070bbc2a8edf2455643 ]

Although the HW User Manual for RZ/V2M states in the "Address Map"
section that the interrupt controller is assigned addresses starting
from 0x82000000, the memory locations from 0x82000000 0x0x8200FFFF
are marked as reserved in the "Interrupt Controller (GIC)" section
and are currently not used by the device tree, leading to the below
warning:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/r9a09g011.dtsi:51.38-63.5: Warning
(simple_bus_reg): /soc/interrupt-controller@82000000: simple-bus unit
address format error, expected "82010000"

Fix the unit address accordingly.

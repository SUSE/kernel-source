Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: gcc-ipq5018: fix 'enable_reg' offset of
 'gcc_gmac0_sys_clk'
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: f982adcc1b1c02a3114f68ac73c811cbfabe90fa

[ Upstream commit f982adcc1b1c02a3114f68ac73c811cbfabe90fa ]

The value of the 'enable_reg' field in the 'gcc_gmac0_sys_clk'
clock definition seems wrong as it is greater than the
'max_register' value defined in the regmap configuration.
Additionally, all other gmac specific branch clock definitions
within the driver uses the same value both for the 'enable_reg'
and for the 'halt_reg' fields.

Due to the lack of documentation the correct value is not known.
Looking into the downstream driver does not help either, as that
uses the same (presumably wrong) value [1].

Nevertheless, change the 'enable_reg' field of 'gcc_gmac0_sys_clk'
to use the value from the 'halt_reg' field so it follows the pattern
used in other gmac clock definitions. The change is based on the
assumption that the register layout of this clock is the same
as the other gmac clocks.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests/mm: switch to bash from sh
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.6
Git-commit: bc29036e1da1cf66e5f8312649aeec2d51ea3d86

commit bc29036e1da1cf66e5f8312649aeec2d51ea3d86 upstream.

Running charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh generates errors if sh is set to
dash:

./charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh: 9: [[: not found
./charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh: 19: [[: not found
./charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh: 27: [[: not found
./charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh: 37: [[: not found
./charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh: 45: Syntax error: "(" unexpected

Switch to using /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh.  Make the switch for
write_hugetlb_memory.sh as well which is called from
charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh.

Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: clk-alpha-pll: fix alpha mode configuration
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: 33f1722eb86e45320a3dd7b3d42f6593a1d595c2

commit 33f1722eb86e45320a3dd7b3d42f6593a1d595c2 upstream.

Commit c45ae598fc16 ("clk: qcom: support for alpha mode configuration")
added support for configuring alpha mode, but it seems that the feature
was never working in practice.

The value of the alpha_{en,mode}_mask members of the configuration gets
added to the value parameter passed to the regmap_update_bits() function,
however the same values are not getting applied to the bitmask. As the
result, the respective bits in the USER_CTL register are never modifed
which leads to improper configuration of several PLLs.

The following table shows the PLL configurations where the 'alpha_en_mask'
member is set and which are passed as a parameter for the
clk_alpha_pll_configure() function. In the table the 'expected rate' column
shows the rate the PLL should run at with the given configuration, and
the 'real rate' column shows the rate the PLL runs at actually. The real
rates has been verified on hardwareOn IPQ* platforms, on other platforms,
those are computed values only.

As it can be seen from the above, there are several PLLs which are
configured incorrectly.

Change the code to apply both 'alpha_en_mask' and 'alpha_mode_mask'
values to the bitmask in order to configure the alpha mode correctly.

Applying the 'alpha_en_mask' fixes the initial rate of the PLLs showed
in the table above. Since the 'alpha_mode_mask' is not used by any driver
currently, that part of the change causes no functional changes.

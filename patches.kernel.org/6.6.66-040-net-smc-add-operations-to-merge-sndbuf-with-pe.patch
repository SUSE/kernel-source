Subject: [PATCH] net/smc: add operations to merge sndbuf with peer DMB
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.66
Git-commit: 4398888268582cb51b69c6ee94f551bb8d37d12f

[ Upstream commit 4398888268582cb51b69c6ee94f551bb8d37d12f ]

In some scenarios using Emulated-ISM device, sndbuf can share the same
physical memory region with peer DMB to avoid data copy from one side
to the other. In such case the sndbuf is only a descriptor that
describes the shared memory and does not actually occupy memory, it's
more like a ghost buffer.

      +----------+                     +----------+
      | socket A |                     | socket B |
      +----------+                     +----------+
            |                               |
       +--------+                       +--------+
       | sndbuf |                       |  DMB   |
       |  desc  |                       |  desc  |
       +--------+                       +--------+
            |                               |
            |                          +----v-----+
            +-------------------------->  memory  |
                                       +----------+

So here introduces three new SMC-D device operations to check if this
feature is supported by device, and to {attach|detach} ghost sndbuf to
peer DMB. For now only loopback-ism supports this.

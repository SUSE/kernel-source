Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996-tone: Fix USB taking 6 minutes to
 wake up
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 43069b9cd358aebc692e654de91ee06ff66e26af

[ Upstream commit 43069b9cd358aebc692e654de91ee06ff66e26af ]

The hardware turns out to be pretty sluggish at assuming it can only
do USB2 with just a USB2 phy assigned to it - before it needed about
6 minutes to acknowledge that.

Limit it to USB-HS explicitly to make USB come up about 720x faster.

Subject: [PATCH] nvme: check IO start time when deciding to defer KA
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.36
Git-commit: 774a9636514764ddc0d072ae0d1d1c01a47e6ddd

[ Upstream commit 774a9636514764ddc0d072ae0d1d1c01a47e6ddd ]

When a command completes, we set a flag which will skip sending a
keep alive at the next run of nvme_keep_alive_work when TBKAS is on.
However, if the command was submitted long ago, it's possible that
the controller may have also restarted its keep alive timer (as a
result of receiving the command) long ago. The following trace
demonstrates the issue, assuming TBKAS is on and KATO = 8 for
simplicity:

1. t = 0: submit I/O commands A, B, C, D, E
2. t = 0.5: commands A, B, C, D, E reach controller, restart its keep
            alive timer
3. t = 1: A completes
4. t = 2: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see recent completion, do nothing
5. t = 3: B completes
6. t = 4: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see recent completion, do nothing
7. t = 5: C completes
8. t = 6: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see recent completion, do nothing
9. t = 7: D completes
10. t = 8: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see recent completion, do nothing
11. t = 9: E completes

At this point, 8.5 seconds have passed without restarting the
controller's keep alive timer, so the controller will detect a keep
alive timeout.

Fix this by checking the IO start time when deciding to defer sending a
keep alive command. Only set comp_seen if the command started after the
most recent run of nvme_keep_alive_work. With this change, the
completions of B, C, and D will not set comp_seen and the run of
nvme_keep_alive_work at t = 4 will send a keep alive.

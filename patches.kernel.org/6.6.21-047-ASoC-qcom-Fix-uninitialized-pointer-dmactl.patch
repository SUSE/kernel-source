Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: qcom: Fix uninitialized pointer dmactl
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.21
Git-commit: 1382d8b55129875b2e07c4d2a7ebc790183769ee

[ Upstream commit 1382d8b55129875b2e07c4d2a7ebc790183769ee ]

In the case where __lpass_get_dmactl_handle is called and the driver
id dai_id is invalid the pointer dmactl is not being assigned a value,
and dmactl contains a garbage value since it has not been initialized
and so the null check may not work. Fix this to initialize dmactl to
NULL. One could argue that modern compilers will set this to zero, but
it is useful to keep this initialized as per the same way in functions
__lpass_platform_codec_intf_init and lpass_cdc_dma_daiops_hw_params.

Cleans up clang scan build warning:
sound/soc/qcom/lpass-cdc-dma.c:275:7: warning: Branch condition
evaluates to a garbage value [core.uninitialized.Branch]

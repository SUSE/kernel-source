Subject: [PATCH] tty: rp2: Fix reset with non forgiving PCIe host bridges
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.54
Git-commit: f16dd10ba342c429b1e36ada545fb36d4d1f0e63

commit f16dd10ba342c429b1e36ada545fb36d4d1f0e63 upstream.

The write to RP2_GLOBAL_CMD followed by an immediate read of
RP2_GLOBAL_CMD in rp2_reset_asic() is intented to flush out the write,
however by then the device is already in reset and cannot respond to a
memory cycle access.

On platforms such as the Raspberry Pi 4 and others using the
pcie-brcmstb.c driver, any memory access to a device that cannot respond
is met with a fatal system error, rather than being substituted with all
1s as is usually the case on PC platforms.

Swapping the delay and the read ensures that the device has finished
resetting before we attempt to read from it.

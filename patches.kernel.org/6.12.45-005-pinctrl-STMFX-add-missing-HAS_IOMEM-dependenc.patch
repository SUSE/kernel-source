Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: STMFX: add missing HAS_IOMEM dependency
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.45
Git-commit: a12946bef0407cf2db0899c83d42c47c00af3fbc

[ Upstream commit a12946bef0407cf2db0899c83d42c47c00af3fbc ]

When building on ARCH=um (which does not set HAS_IOMEM), kconfig
reports an unmet dependency caused by PINCTRL_STMFX. It selects
MFD_STMFX, which depends on HAS_IOMEM. To stop this warning,
PINCTRL_STMFX should also depend on HAS_IOMEM.

kconfig warning:
WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for MFD_STMFX
  Depends on [n]: HAS_IOMEM [=n] && I2C [=y] && OF [=y]
  Selected by [y]:
  - PINCTRL_STMFX [=y] && PINCTRL [=y] && I2C [=y] && OF_GPIO [=y]

Subject: [PATCH] ovl: Always reevaluate the file signature for IMA
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: 18b44bc5a67275641fb26f2c54ba7eef80ac5950

[ Upstream commit 18b44bc5a67275641fb26f2c54ba7eef80ac5950 ]

Commit db1d1e8b9867 ("IMA: use vfs_getattr_nosec to get the i_version")
partially closed an IMA integrity issue when directly modifying a file
on the lower filesystem.  If the overlay file is first opened by a user
and later the lower backing file is modified by root, but the extended
attribute is NOT updated, the signature validation succeeds with the old
original signature.

Update the super_block s_iflags to SB_I_IMA_UNVERIFIABLE_SIGNATURE to
force signature reevaluation on every file access until a fine grained
solution can be found.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/xen: Allow 'out of range' event channel ports in IRQ
 routing table.
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.39
Git-commit: a7f4dff21fd744d08fa956c243d2b1795f23cbf7

commit a7f4dff21fd744d08fa956c243d2b1795f23cbf7 upstream.

To avoid imposing an ordering constraint on userspace, allow 'invalid'
event channel targets to be configured in the IRQ routing table.

This is the same as accepting interrupts targeted at vCPUs which don't
exist yet, which is already the case for both Xen event channels *and*
for MSIs (which don't do any filtering of permitted APIC ID targets at
all).

If userspace actually *triggers* an IRQ with an invalid target, that
will fail cleanly, as kvm_xen_set_evtchn_fast() also does the same range
check.

If KVM enforced that the IRQ target must be valid at the time it is
*configured*, that would force userspace to create all vCPUs and do
various other parts of setup (in this case, setting the Xen long_mode)
before restoring the IRQ table.

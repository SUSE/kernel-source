Subject: [PATCH] mm/gup: check ref_count instead of lru before migration
References: bsc#1234429

[ Upstream commit 98c6d259319ecf6e8d027abd3f14b81324b8c0ad ]

Patch series "mm: better GUP pin lru_add_drain_all()", v2.

Series of lru_add_drain_all()-related patches, arising from recent mm/gup
migration report from Will Deacon.

This patch (of 5):

Will Deacon reports:-

When taking a longterm GUP pin via pin_user_pages(),
__gup_longterm_locked() tries to migrate target folios that should not be
longterm pinned, for example because they reside in a CMA region or
movable zone.  This is done by first pinning all of the target folios
anyway, collecting all of the longterm-unpinnable target folios into a
list, dropping the pins that were just taken and finally handing the list
off to migrate_pages() for the actual migration.

It is critically important that no unexpected references are held on the
folios being migrated, otherwise the migration will fail and
pin_user_pages() will return -ENOMEM to its caller.  Unfortunately, it is
relatively easy to observe migration failures when running pKVM (which
uses pin_user_pages() on crosvm's virtual address space to resolve stage-2
page faults from the guest) on a 6.15-based Pixel 6 device and this
results in the VM terminating prematurely.

In the failure case, 'crosvm' has called mlock(MLOCK_ONFAULT) on its
mapping of guest memory prior to the pinning.  Subsequently, when
pin_user_pages() walks the page-table, the relevant 'pte' is not present
and so the faulting logic allocates a new folio, mlocks it with
mlock_folio() and maps it in the page-table.

Since commit 2fbb0c10d1e8 ("mm/munlock: mlock_page() munlock_page() batch
by pagevec"), mlock/munlock operations on a folio (formerly page), are
deferred.  For example, mlock_folio() takes an additional reference on the
target folio before placing it into a per-cpu 'folio_batch' for later
processing by mlock_folio_batch(), which drops the refcount once the
operation is complete.  Processing of the batches is coupled with the LRU
batch logic and can be forcefully drained with lru_add_drain_all() but as
long as a folio remains unprocessed on the batch, its refcount will be
elevated.

This deferred batching therefore interacts poorly with the pKVM pinning
scenario as we can find ourselves in a situation where the migration code
fails to migrate a folio due to the elevated refcount from the pending
mlock operation.

Hugh Dickins adds:-

!folio_test_lru() has never been a very reliable way to tell if an
lru_add_drain_all() is worth calling, to remove LRU cache references to
make the folio migratable: the LRU flag may be set even while the folio is
held with an extra reference in a per-CPU LRU cache.

5.18 commit 2fbb0c10d1e8 may have made it more unreliable.  Then 6.11
commit 33dfe9204f29 ("mm/gup: clear the LRU flag of a page before adding
to LRU batch") tried to make it reliable, by moving LRU flag clearing; but
missed the mlock/munlock batches, so still unreliable as reported.

And it turns out to be difficult to extend 33dfe9204f29's LRU flag
clearing to the mlock/munlock batches: if they do benefit from batching,
mlock/munlock cannot be so effective when easily suppressed while !LRU.

Instead, switch to an expected ref_count check, which was more reliable
all along: some more false positives (unhelpful drains) than before, and
never a guarantee that the folio will prove migratable, but better.

Note on PG_private_2: ceph and nfs are still using the deprecated
PG_private_2 flag, with the aid of netfs and filemap support functions.
Although it is consistently matched by an increment of folio ref_count,
folio_expected_ref_count() intentionally does not recognize it, and ceph
folio migration currently depends on that for PG_private_2 folios to be
rejected.  New references to the deprecated flag are discouraged, so do
not add it into the collect_longterm_unpinnable_folios() calculation: but
longterm pinning of transiently PG_private_2 ceph and nfs folios (an
uncommon case) may invoke a redundant lru_add_drain_all().  And this makes
easy the backport to earlier releases: up to and including 6.12, btrfs
also used PG_private_2, but without a ref_count increment.

Note for stable backports: requires 6.16 commit 86ebd50224c0 ("mm:
add folio_expected_ref_count() for reference count calculation").

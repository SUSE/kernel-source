Subject: [PATCH] s390/bpf: Fix bpf_arch_text_poke() with new_addr == NULL
 again
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.40
Git-commit: 6a5abf8cf182f577c7ae6c62f14debc9754ec986

commit 6a5abf8cf182f577c7ae6c62f14debc9754ec986 upstream.

Commit 7ded842b356d ("s390/bpf: Fix bpf_plt pointer arithmetic") has
accidentally removed the critical piece of commit c730fce7c70c
("s390/bpf: Fix bpf_arch_text_poke() with new_addr == NULL"), causing
intermittent kernel panics in e.g. perf's on_switch() prog to reappear.

Restore the fix and add a comment.

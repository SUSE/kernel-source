Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8180x: Fix LLCC reg property
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.3
Git-commit: 74cf6675c35ec3034053a69926f4d98e52852eb0

[ Upstream commit 74cf6675c35ec3034053a69926f4d98e52852eb0 ]

The LLCC binding and driver was recently corrected to handle the stride
varying between platforms. Switch to the new format to ensure accesses
are done in the right place.

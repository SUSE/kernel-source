Subject: [PATCH] firmware: arm_scmi: Fix list protocols enumeration in the
 base protocol
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 8009120e0354a67068e920eb10dce532391361d0

[ Upstream commit 8009120e0354a67068e920eb10dce532391361d0 ]

While enumerating protocols implemented by the SCMI platform using
BASE_DISCOVER_LIST_PROTOCOLS, the number of returned protocols is
currently validated in an improper way since the check employs a sum
between unsigned integers that could overflow and cause the check itself
to be silently bypassed if the returned value 'loop_num_ret' is big
enough.

Fix the validation avoiding the addition.

Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: fix provided buffer import
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.11
Git-commit: 09007af2b627f0f195c6c53c4829b285cc3990ec

commit 09007af2b627f0f195c6c53c4829b285cc3990ec upstream.

io_import_iovec uses the s pointer, but this was changed immediately
after the iovec was re-imported and so it was imported into the wrong
place.

Change the ordering.

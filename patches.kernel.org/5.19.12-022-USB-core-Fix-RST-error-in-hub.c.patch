Subject: [PATCH] USB: core: Fix RST error in hub.c
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.12
Git-commit: 766a96dc558385be735a370db867e302c8f22153

commit 766a96dc558385be735a370db867e302c8f22153 upstream.

A recent commit added an invalid RST expression to a kerneldoc comment
in hub.c.  The fix is trivial.

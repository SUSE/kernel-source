Subject: [PATCH] nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in
 nilfs_find_entry()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.5
Git-commit: 985ebec4ab0a28bb5910c3b1481a40fbf7f9e61d

commit 985ebec4ab0a28bb5910c3b1481a40fbf7f9e61d upstream.

Syzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the
inode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value, memory access outside
the folio/page range may occur, or a use-after-free bug may be detected if
KASAN is enabled.

This is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry()
and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a
page from i_size and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit
size information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which
the i_size value is assigned.

This caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address
calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting in memory access
that exceeds the folio/page size.

Fix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit
loss from "unsigned int" to "u64".  The return value of nilfs_last_byte()
is also of type "unsigned int", but it is truncated so as not to exceed
PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required.

Subject: [PATCH] firmware: smccc: Fix check for ARCH_SOC_ID not implemented
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.6
Git-commit: e95d8eaee21cd0d117d34125d4cdc97489c1ab82

[ Upstream commit e95d8eaee21cd0d117d34125d4cdc97489c1ab82 ]

The ARCH_FEATURES function ID is a 32-bit SMC call, which returns
a 32-bit result per the SMCCC spec.  Current code is doing a 64-bit
comparison against -1 (SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED) to detect that the
feature is unimplemented.  That check doesn't work in a Hyper-V VM,
where the upper 32-bits are zero as allowed by the spec.

Cast the result as an 'int' so the comparison works. The change also
makes the code consistent with other similar checks in this file.

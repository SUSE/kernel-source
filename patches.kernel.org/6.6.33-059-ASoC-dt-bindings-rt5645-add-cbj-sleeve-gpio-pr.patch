Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dt-bindings: rt5645: add cbj sleeve gpio property
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.33
Git-commit: 306b38e3fa727d22454a148a364123709e356600

[ Upstream commit 306b38e3fa727d22454a148a364123709e356600 ]

Add an optional gpio property to control external CBJ circuits
to avoid some electric noise caused by sleeve/ring2 contacts floating.

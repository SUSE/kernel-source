Subject: [PATCH] riscv: dts: microchip: correct L2 cache interrupts

commit 34fc9cc3aebe8b9e27d3bc821543dd482dc686ca upstream.

The "PolarFire SoC MSS Technical Reference Manual" documents the
following PLIC interrupts:

1 - L2 Cache Controller Signals when a metadata correction event occurs
2 - L2 Cache Controller Signals when an uncorrectable metadata event occurs
3 - L2 Cache Controller Signals when a data correction event occurs
4 - L2 Cache Controller Signals when an uncorrectable data event occurs

This differs from the SiFive FU540 which only has three L2 cache related
interrupts.

The sequence in the device tree is defined by an enum:

    enum {
            DIR_CORR = 0,
            DATA_CORR,
            DATA_UNCORR,
            DIR_UNCORR,
    };

So the correct sequence of the L2 cache interrupts is

    interrupts = <1>, <3>, <4>, <2>;

[Conor]
This manifests as an unusable system if the l2-cache driver is enabled,
as the wrong interrupt gets cleared & the handler prints errors to the
console ad infinitum.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: remove num-slots property from
 rk3328-nanopi-r2s-plus
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: b1f8d3b81d9289e171141a7120093ddefe7bd2f4

[ Upstream commit b1f8d3b81d9289e171141a7120093ddefe7bd2f4 ]

num-slots was not part of the dw-mmc binding and the last slipage of
one of them seeping in from the vendor kernel was removed way back in
2017. Somehow the nanopi-r2s-plus managed to smuggle another on in the
kernel, so remove that as well.

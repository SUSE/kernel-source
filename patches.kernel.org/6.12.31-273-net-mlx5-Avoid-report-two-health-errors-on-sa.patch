Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5: Avoid report two health errors on same syndrome
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: b5d7b2f04ebcff740f44ef4d295b3401aeb029f4

[ Upstream commit b5d7b2f04ebcff740f44ef4d295b3401aeb029f4 ]

In case health counter has not increased for few polling intervals, miss
counter will reach max misses threshold and health report will be
triggered for FW health reporter. In case syndrome found on same health
poll another health report will be triggered.

Avoid two health reports on same syndrome by marking this syndrome as
already known.

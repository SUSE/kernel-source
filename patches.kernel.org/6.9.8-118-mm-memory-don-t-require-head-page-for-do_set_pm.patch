Subject: [PATCH] mm/memory: don't require head page for do_set_pmd()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.8
Git-commit: ab1ffc86cb5bec1c92387b9811d9036512f8f4eb

commit ab1ffc86cb5bec1c92387b9811d9036512f8f4eb upstream.

The requirement that the head page be passed to do_set_pmd() was added in
commit ef37b2ea08ac ("mm/memory: page_add_file_rmap() ->
folio_add_file_rmap_[pte|pmd]()") and prevents pmd-mapping in the
finish_fault() and filemap_map_pages() paths if the page to be inserted is
anything but the head page for an otherwise suitable vma and pmd-sized
page.

Matthew said:

: We're going to stop using PMDs to map large folios unless the fault is
: within the first 4KiB of the PMD.  No idea how many workloads that
: affects, but it only needs to be backported as far as v6.8, so we may
: as well backport it.

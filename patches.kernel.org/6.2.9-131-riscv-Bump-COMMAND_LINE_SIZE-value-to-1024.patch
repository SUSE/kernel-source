Subject: [PATCH] riscv: Bump COMMAND_LINE_SIZE value to 1024
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.9
Git-commit: 61fc1ee8be26bc192d691932b0a67eabee45d12f

[ Upstream commit 61fc1ee8be26bc192d691932b0a67eabee45d12f ]

Increase COMMAND_LINE_SIZE as the current default value is too low
for syzbot kernel command line.

There has been considerable discussion on this patch that has led to a
larger patch set removing COMMAND_LINE_SIZE from the uapi headers on all
ports.  That's not quite done yet, but it's gotten far enough we're
confident this is not a uABI change so this is safe.

Subject: [PATCH] ibmvnic: Remove the proper scrq flush
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.6
Git-commit: bb55362bd6976631b662ca712779b6532d8de0a6

[ Upstream commit bb55362bd6976631b662ca712779b6532d8de0a6 ]

Commit 65d6470d139a ("ibmvnic: clean pending indirect buffs during reset")
intended to remove the call to ibmvnic_tx_scrq_flush() when the
->resetting flag is true and was tested that way. But during the final
rebase to net-next, the hunk got applied to a block few lines below
(which happened to have the same diff context) and the wrong call to
ibmvnic_tx_scrq_flush() got removed.

Fix that by removing the correct ibmvnic_tx_scrq_flush() and restoring
the one that was incorrectly removed.

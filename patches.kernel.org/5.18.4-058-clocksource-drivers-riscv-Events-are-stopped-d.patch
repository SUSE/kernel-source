Subject: [PATCH] clocksource/drivers/riscv: Events are stopped during CPU
 suspend
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.4
Git-commit: 232ccac1bd9b5bfe73895f527c08623e7fa0752d

[ Upstream commit 232ccac1bd9b5bfe73895f527c08623e7fa0752d ]

Some implementations of the SBI time extension depend on hart-local
state (for example, CSRs) that are lost or hardware that is powered
down when a CPU is suspended. To be safe, the clockevents driver
cannot assume that timer IRQs will be received during CPU suspend.

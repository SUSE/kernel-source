Subject: [PATCH] block: ublk_drv: mark device as LIVE before adding disk
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.12
Git-commit: 4985e7b2c002eb4c5c794a1d3acd91b82c89a0fd

[ Upstream commit 4985e7b2c002eb4c5c794a1d3acd91b82c89a0fd ]

IO can be started before add_disk() returns, such as reading parititon table,
then the monitor work should work for making forward progress.

So mark device as LIVE before adding disk, meantime change to
DEAD if add_disk() fails.

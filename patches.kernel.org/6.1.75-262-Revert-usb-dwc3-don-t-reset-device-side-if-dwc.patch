Subject: [PATCH] Revert "usb: dwc3: don't reset device side if dwc3 was
 configured as host-only"
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: afe28cd686aeb77e8d9140d50fb1cf06a7ecb731

commit afe28cd686aeb77e8d9140d50fb1cf06a7ecb731 upstream.

This reverts commit e835c0a4e23c38531dcee5ef77e8d1cf462658c7.

Don't omit soft-reset. During initialization, the driver may need to
perform a soft reset to ensure the phy is ready when the controller
updates the GCTL.PRTCAPDIR or other settings by issuing phy soft-reset.
Many platforms often have access to DCTL register for soft-reset despite
being host-only. If there are actual reported issues from the platforms
that don't expose DCTL registers, then we will need to revisit (perhaps
to teach dwc3 to perform xhci's soft-reset USBCMD.HCRST).

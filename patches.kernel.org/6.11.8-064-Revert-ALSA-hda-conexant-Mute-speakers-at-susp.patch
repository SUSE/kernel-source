commit c9363bbb0f68dd1ddb8be7bbfe958cdfcd38d851 upstream.

Commit 4f61c8fe3520 ("ALSA: hda/conexant: Mute speakers at suspend /
shutdown") mutes speakers on system shutdown or whenever HDA controller
is suspended by PM; this however interacts badly with Thinkpad's ACPI
firmware behavior which uses beeps to signal various events (enter/leave
suspend or hibernation, AC power connect/disconnect, low battery, etc.);
now those beeps are either muted altogether (for suspend/hibernate/
shutdown related events) or work more or less randomly (eg. AC
plug/unplug is only audible when you are playing music at the moment,
because HDA device is likely in suspend mode otherwise).

Since the original bug report mentioned in 4f61c8fe3520 complained about
Lenovo's Thinkpad laptop - revert this commit altogether.

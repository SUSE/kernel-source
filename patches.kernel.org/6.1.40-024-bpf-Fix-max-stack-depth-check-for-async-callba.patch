Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Fix max stack depth check for async callbacks
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.40
Git-commit: 5415ccd50a8620c8cbaa32d6f18c946c453566f5

[ Upstream commit 5415ccd50a8620c8cbaa32d6f18c946c453566f5 ]

The check_max_stack_depth pass happens after the verifier's symbolic
execution, and attempts to walk the call graph of the BPF program,
ensuring that the stack usage stays within bounds for all possible call
chains. There are two cases to consider: bpf_pseudo_func and
bpf_pseudo_call. In the former case, the callback pointer is loaded into
a register, and is assumed that it is passed to some helper later which
calls it (however there is no way to be sure), but the check remains
conservative and accounts the stack usage anyway. For this particular
case, asynchronous callbacks are skipped as they execute asynchronously
when their corresponding event fires.

The case of bpf_pseudo_call is simpler and we know that the call is
definitely made, hence the stack depth of the subprog is accounted for.

However, the current check still skips an asynchronous callback even if
a bpf_pseudo_call was made for it. This is erroneous, as it will miss
accounting for the stack usage of the asynchronous callback, which can
be used to breach the maximum stack depth limit.

Fix this by only skipping asynchronous callbacks when the instruction is
not a pseudo call to the subprog.

Subject: [PATCH] rxrpc: Make it so that a waiting process can be aborted
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.3
Git-commit: 0eb362d254814ce04848730bf32e75b8ee1a4d6c

[ Upstream commit 0eb362d254814ce04848730bf32e75b8ee1a4d6c ]

When sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues it to wait for a connection
and channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start shovelling
data as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the
connection parameters.

However, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned
and further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is
made.

Fix this so that the call can at least be aborted without failing on
EBUSY.  We have to be careful here as sendmsg() mustn't be allowed to start
the call timer if the call doesn't yet have a connection assigned as an
oops may follow shortly thereafter.

Fixes: 540b1c48c37a ("rxrpc: Fix deadlock between call creation and sendmsg/recvmsg")

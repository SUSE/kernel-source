Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix probe of analog sound card on
 rock-3a
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.15
Git-commit: 1104693cdfcd337e73ab585a225f05445ff7a864

[ Upstream commit 1104693cdfcd337e73ab585a225f05445ff7a864 ]

The following was observed on my Radxa ROCK 3 Model A board:

  rockchip-pinctrl pinctrl: pin gpio1-9 already requested by vcc-cam-regulator; cannot claim for fe410000.i2s
  ...
  platform rk809-sound: deferred probe pending

Fix this by supplying a board specific pinctrl with the i2s1 pins used
by pmic codec according to the schematic [1].

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: fix codec reset line polarity for
 CRD 1.0/2.0
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: b8f298d4f69d82119ac0d22809a17c80b1f188d1

[ Upstream commit b8f298d4f69d82119ac0d22809a17c80b1f188d1 ]

The driver for the codec, when resetting the chip, first drives the line
low, and then high. This means that the line is active low. Change the
annotation in the DTS accordingly.

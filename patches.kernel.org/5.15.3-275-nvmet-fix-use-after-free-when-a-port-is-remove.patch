Subject: [PATCH] nvmet: fix use-after-free when a port is removed
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: e3e19dcc4c416d65f99f13d55be2b787f8d0050e

[ Upstream commit e3e19dcc4c416d65f99f13d55be2b787f8d0050e ]

When a port is removed through configfs, any connected controllers
are starting teardown flow asynchronously and can still send commands.
This causes a use-after-free bug for any command that dereferences
req->port (like in nvmet_parse_io_cmd).

To fix this, wait for all the teardown scheduled works to complete
(like release_work at rdma/tcp drivers). This ensures there are no
active controllers when the port is eventually removed.

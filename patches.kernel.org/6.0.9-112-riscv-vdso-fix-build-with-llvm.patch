Subject: [PATCH] riscv: vdso: fix build with llvm
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.9
Git-commit: 50f4dd657a0fcf90aa8da8dc2794a8100ff4c37c

[ Upstream commit 50f4dd657a0fcf90aa8da8dc2794a8100ff4c37c ]

Even after commit 89fd4a1df829 ("riscv: jump_label: mark arguments as
const to satisfy asm constraints"), building with CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
+ LLVM=1 can reproduce below build error:

I think the problem is when "-Os" is passed as CFLAGS, it's removed by
"CFLAGS_REMOVE_vgettimeofday.o = $(CC_FLAGS_FTRACE) -Os" which is
introduced in commit e05d57dcb8c7 ("riscv: Fixup __vdso_gettimeofday
broke dynamic ftrace"), thus no optimization at all for vgettimeofday.c
arm64 does remove "-Os" as well, but it forces "-O2" after removing
"-Os".

I compared the generated vgettimeofday.o with "-O2" and "-Os",
I think no big performance difference. So let's tell the kbuild not
to remove "-Os" rather than follow arm64 style.

vdso related performance can be improved a lot when building kernel with
CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE after this commit, ("-Os" VS no optimization)

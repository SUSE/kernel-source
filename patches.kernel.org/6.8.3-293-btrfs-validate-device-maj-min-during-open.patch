Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: validate device maj:min during open
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: 9f7eb8405dcbc79c5434821e9e3e92abe187ee8e

commit 9f7eb8405dcbc79c5434821e9e3e92abe187ee8e upstream.

Boris managed to create a device capable of changing its maj:min without
altering its device path.

Only multi-devices can be scanned. A device that gets scanned and remains
in the btrfs kernel cache might end up with an incorrect maj:min.

Despite the temp-fsid feature patch did not introduce this bug, it could
lead to issues if the above multi-device is converted to a single device
with a stale maj:min. Subsequently, attempting to mount the same device
with the correct maj:min might mistake it for another device with the same
fsid, potentially resulting in wrongly auto-enabling the temp-fsid feature.

To address this, this patch validates the device's maj:min at the time of
device open and updates it if it has changed since the last scan.

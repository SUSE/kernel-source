Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: dw-hdmi: use safe format when first in bridge
 chain
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: 1528038385c0a706aac9ac165eeb24044fef6825

[ Upstream commit 1528038385c0a706aac9ac165eeb24044fef6825 ]

When the dw-hdmi bridge is in first place of the bridge chain, this
means there is no way to select an input format of the dw-hdmi HW
component.

Since introduction of display-connector, negotiation was broken since
the dw-hdmi negotiation code only worked when the dw-hdmi bridge was
in last position of the bridge chain or behind another bridge also
supporting input & output format negotiation.

Commit 7cd70656d128 ("drm/bridge: display-connector: implement bus fmts callbacks")
was introduced to make negotiation work again by making display-connector
act as a pass-through concerning input & output format negotiation.

But in the case where the dw-hdmi is single in the bridge chain, for
example on Renesas SoCs, with the display-connector bridge the dw-hdmi
is no more single, breaking output format.

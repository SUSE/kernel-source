Subject: [PATCH] net: sysfs: Fix /sys/class/net/<iface> path for statistics
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.6
Git-commit: 5b3fbd61b9d1f4ed2db95aaf03f9adae0373784d

[ Upstream commit 5b3fbd61b9d1f4ed2db95aaf03f9adae0373784d ]

The Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-net-statistics documentation
is pointing to the wrong path for the interface.  Documentation is
pointing to /sys/class/<iface>, instead of /sys/class/net/<iface>.

Fix it by adding the `net/` directory before the interface.

Fixes: 6044f9700645 ("net: sysfs: document /sys/class/net/statistics/*")

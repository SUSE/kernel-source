Subject: [PATCH] PM: domains: Fix initialization of genpd's next_wakeup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 622d9b5577f19a6472db21df042fea8f5fefe244

[ Upstream commit 622d9b5577f19a6472db21df042fea8f5fefe244 ]

In the genpd governor we walk the list of child-domains to take into
account their next_wakeup. If the child-domain itself, doesn't have a
governor assigned to it, we can end up using the next_wakeup value before
it has been properly initialized. To prevent a possible incorrect behaviour
in the governor, let's initialize next_wakeup to KTIME_MAX.

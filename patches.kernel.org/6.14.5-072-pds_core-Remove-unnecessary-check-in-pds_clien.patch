Subject: [PATCH] pds_core: Remove unnecessary check in pds_client_adminq_cmd()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.5
Git-commit: f9559d818205a4a0b9cd87181ef46e101ea11157

[ Upstream commit f9559d818205a4a0b9cd87181ef46e101ea11157 ]

When the pds_core driver was first created there were some race
conditions around using the adminq, especially for client drivers.
To reduce the possibility of a race condition there's a check
against pf->state in pds_client_adminq_cmd(). This is problematic
for a couple of reasons:

1. The PDSC_S_INITING_DRIVER bit is set during probe, but not
   cleared until after everything in probe is complete, which
   includes creating the auxiliary devices. For pds_fwctl this
   means it can't make any adminq commands until after pds_core's
   probe is complete even though the adminq is fully up by the
   time pds_fwctl's auxiliary device is created.

2. The race conditions around using the adminq have been fixed
   and this path is already protected against client drivers
   calling pds_client_adminq_cmd() if the adminq isn't ready,
   i.e. see pdsc_adminq_post() -> pdsc_adminq_inc_if_up().

Fix this by removing the pf->state check in pds_client_adminq_cmd()
because invalid accesses to pds_core's adminq is already handled by
pdsc_adminq_post()->pdsc_adminq_inc_if_up().

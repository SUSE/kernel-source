Subject: [PATCH] arm64/sme: Restore SMCR_EL1.EZT0 on exit from suspend
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: d7b77a0d565b048cb0808fa8a4fb031352b22a01

[ Upstream commit d7b77a0d565b048cb0808fa8a4fb031352b22a01 ]

The fields in SMCR_EL1 reset to an architecturally UNKNOWN value. Since we
do not otherwise manage the traps configured in this register at runtime we
need to reconfigure them after a suspend in case nothing else was kind
enough to preserve them for us. Do so for SMCR_EL1.EZT0.

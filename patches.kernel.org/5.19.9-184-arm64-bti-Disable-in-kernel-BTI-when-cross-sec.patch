Subject: [PATCH] arm64/bti: Disable in kernel BTI when cross section thunks
 are broken
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.9
Git-commit: c0a454b9044fdc99486853aa424e5b3be2107078

commit c0a454b9044fdc99486853aa424e5b3be2107078 upstream.

GCC does not insert a `bti c` instruction at the beginning of a function
when it believes that all callers reach the function through a direct
branch[1]. Unfortunately the logic it uses to determine this is not
sufficiently robust, for example not taking account of functions being
placed in different sections which may be loaded separately, so we may
still see thunks being generated to these functions. If that happens,
the first instruction in the callee function will result in a Branch
Target Exception due to the missing landing pad.

While this has currently only been observed in the case of modules
having their main code loaded sufficiently far from their init section
to require thunks it could potentially happen for other cases so the
safest thing is to disable BTI for the kernel when building with an
affected toolchain.

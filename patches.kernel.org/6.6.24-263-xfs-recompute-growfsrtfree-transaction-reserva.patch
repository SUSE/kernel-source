Subject: [PATCH] xfs: recompute growfsrtfree transaction reservation while
 growing rt volume
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.24
Git-commit: 578bd4ce7100ae34f98c6b0147fe75cfa0dadbac

commit 578bd4ce7100ae34f98c6b0147fe75cfa0dadbac upstream.

While playing with growfs to create a 20TB realtime section on a
filesystem that didn't previously have an rt section, I noticed that
growfs would occasionally shut down the log due to a transaction
reservation overflow.

xfs_calc_growrtfree_reservation uses the current size of the realtime
summary file (m_rsumsize) to compute the transaction reservation for a
growrtfree transaction.  The reservations are computed at mount time,
which means that m_rsumsize is zero when growfs starts "freeing" the new
realtime extents into the rt volume.  As a result, the transaction is
undersized and fails.

Fix this by recomputing the transaction reservations every time we
change m_rsumsize.

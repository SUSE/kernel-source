Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: cs35l56: Disable low-power hibernation mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: 18789be8e0d9fbb78b2290dcf93f500726ed19f0

commit 18789be8e0d9fbb78b2290dcf93f500726ed19f0 upstream.

Do not allow the CS35L56 to be put into its lowest power
"hibernation" mode. This only affects I2C because "hibernation"
is already disabled on SPI and SoundWire.

Recent firmwares need a different wake-up sequence. Until
that sequence has been specified, the chip "hibernation" mode
must be disabled otherwise it can intermittently fail to wake.

Backport note: This is the same change as upstream commit, to delete
one line, but the upstream commit would not apply cleanly on older
branches because of minor differences to the surrounding code.

Subject: [PATCH] net/sched: act_mirred: Add carrier check
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 526f28bd0fbdc699cda31426928802650c1528e5

[ Upstream commit 526f28bd0fbdc699cda31426928802650c1528e5 ]

There are cases where the device is adminstratively UP, but operationally
down. For example, we have a physical device (Nvidia ConnectX-6 Dx, 25Gbps)
who's cable was pulled out, here is its ip link output:

5: ens2f1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether b8:ce:f6:4b:68:35 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp179s0f1np1

As you can see, it's administratively UP but operationally down.
In this case, sending a packet to this port caused a nasty kernel hang (so
nasty that we were unable to capture it). Aborting a transmit based on
operational status (in addition to administrative status) fixes the issue.

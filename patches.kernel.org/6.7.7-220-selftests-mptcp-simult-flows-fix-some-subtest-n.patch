Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: simult flows: fix some subtest names
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: 4d8e0dde0403b5a86aa83e243f020711a9c3e31f

commit 4d8e0dde0403b5a86aa83e243f020711a9c3e31f upstream.

The selftest was correctly recording all the results, but the 'reverse
direction' part was missing in the name when needed.

It is important to have a unique (sub)test name in TAP, because some CI
environments drop tests with duplicated name.

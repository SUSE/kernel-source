Subject: [PATCH] net: rtnetlink: fix module reference count leak issue in
 rtnetlink_rcv_msg
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: 5b22f62724a0a09e00d301abf5b57b0c12be8a16

commit 5b22f62724a0a09e00d301abf5b57b0c12be8a16 upstream.

When bulk delete command is received in the rtnetlink_rcv_msg function,
if bulk delete is not supported, module_put is not called to release
the reference counting. As a result, module reference count is leaked.

Subject: [PATCH] misc: lis3lv02d: Fix correct sysfs directory path for
 lis3lv02d
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 7b386d7454b610534026b279aa150e5a9e584082

[ Upstream commit 7b386d7454b610534026b279aa150e5a9e584082 ]

The lis3lv02d driver does not create a platform device anymore. It was
recently changed to use a faux device instead. Therefore the sysfs path
has changed from /sys/devices/platform/lis3lv02d to
/sys/devices/faux/lis3lv02d.

Fixes: 3b18ccb5472b ("misc: lis3lv02d: convert to use faux_device")

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: video: Add acpi_backlight=video quirk for Apple
 iMac14,1 and iMac14,2
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.11
Git-commit: 2699107989431d6db44f8a9e809ea74c387336d1

commit 2699107989431d6db44f8a9e809ea74c387336d1 upstream.

On the Apple iMac14,1 and iMac14,2 all-in-ones (monitors with builtin "PC")
the connection between the GPU and the panel is seen by the GPU driver as
regular DP instead of eDP, causing the GPU driver to never call
acpi_video_register_backlight().

(GPU drivers only call acpi_video_register_backlight() when an internal
 panel is detected, to avoid non working acpi_video# devices getting
 registered on desktops which unfortunately is a real issue.)

Fix the missing acpi_video# backlight device on these all-in-ones by
adding a acpi_backlight=video DMI quirk, so that video.ko will
immediately register the backlight device instead of waiting for
an acpi_video_register_backlight() call.

Fixes: 5aa9d943e9b6 ("ACPI: video: Don't enable fallback path for creating ACPI backlight by default")

Subject: [PATCH] scsi: lpfc: Fix NVMe I/O failover to non-optimized path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: b507357f79171fb4fb4e732ca43a1f30bc5aab1d

[ Upstream commit b507357f79171fb4fb4e732ca43a1f30bc5aab1d ]

Currently, we hold off unregistering with NVMe transport layer until GID_FT
or ADISC completes upon receipt of RSCN. In the ADISC discovery routine,
for nodes not found in the GID_FT response, the nodes are unregistered from
the SCSI transport but not UNREG_RPI'd. Meaning outstanding WQEs continue
to be outstanding and were not failed back to the OS. If an NVMe device,
this mean there wasn't initial termination of the I/Os so they could be
issued on a different NVMe path.

Fix by unregistering the RPI so that I/O is cancelled.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62a7: Drop McASP AFIFOs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: a931b81072921a11d5bb8e8201b6228b791d40a9

[ Upstream commit a931b81072921a11d5bb8e8201b6228b791d40a9 ]

McASP AFIFOs are not necessary with UDMA-P/BCDMA as there is buffering
on the DMA IP. Drop these for better audio latency.

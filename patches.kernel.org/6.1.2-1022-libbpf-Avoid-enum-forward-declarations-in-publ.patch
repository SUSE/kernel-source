Subject: [PATCH] libbpf: Avoid enum forward-declarations in public API in C++
 mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: b42693415b86f608049cf1b4870adc1dc65e58b0

[ Upstream commit b42693415b86f608049cf1b4870adc1dc65e58b0 ]

C++ enum forward declarations are fundamentally not compatible with pure
C enum definitions, and so libbpf's use of `enum bpf_stats_type;`
forward declaration in libbpf/bpf.h public API header is causing C++
compilation issues.

More details can be found in [0], but it comes down to C++ supporting
enum forward declaration only with explicitly specified backing type:

  enum bpf_stats_type: int;

In C (and I believe it's a GCC extension also), such forward declaration
is simply:

  enum bpf_stats_type;

Further, in Linux UAPI this enum is defined in pure C way:

enum bpf_stats_type { BPF_STATS_RUN_TIME = 0; }

And even though in both cases backing type is int, which can be
confirmed by looking at DWARF information, for C++ compiler actual enum
definition and forward declaration are incompatible.

To eliminate this problem, for C++ mode define input argument as int,
which makes enum unnecessary in libbpf public header. This solves the
issue and as demonstrated by next patch doesn't cause any unwanted
compiler warnings, at least with default warnings setting.

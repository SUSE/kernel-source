Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon/sysfs-schemes: free old
 damon_sysfs_scheme_filter->memcg_path on write
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.36
Git-commit: 4f489fe6afb395dbc79840efa3c05440b760d883

commit 4f489fe6afb395dbc79840efa3c05440b760d883 upstream.

memcg_path_store() assigns a newly allocated memory buffer to
filter->memcg_path, without deallocating the previously allocated and
assigned memory buffer.  As a result, users can leak kernel memory by
continuously writing a data to memcg_path DAMOS sysfs file.  Fix the leak
by deallocating the previously set memory buffer.

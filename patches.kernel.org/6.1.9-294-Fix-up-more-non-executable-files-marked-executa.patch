Subject: [PATCH] Fix up more non-executable files marked executable
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.9
Git-commit: c96618275234ad03d44eafe9f8844305bb44fda4

[ Upstream commit c96618275234ad03d44eafe9f8844305bb44fda4 ]

Joe found another DT file that shouldn't be executable, and that
frustrated me enough that I went hunting with this script:

    git ls-files -s |
        grep '^100755' |
        cut -f2 |
        xargs grep -L '^#!'

and that found another file that shouldn't have been marked executable
either, despite being in the scripts directory.

Maybe these two are the last ones at least for now.  But I'm sure we'll
be back in a few years, fixing things up again.

Fixes: 4d8e5cd233db ("locking/atomics: Fix scripts/atomic/ script permissions")

Subject: [PATCH] direct_write_fallback(): on error revert the ->ki_pos update
 from buffered write
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: 8287474aa5ffb41df52552c4ae4748e791d2faf2

[ Upstream commit 8287474aa5ffb41df52552c4ae4748e791d2faf2 ]

If we fail filemap_write_and_wait_range() on the range the buffered write went
into, we only report the "number of bytes which we direct-written", to quote
the comment in there.  Which is fine, but buffered write has already advanced
iocb->ki_pos, so we need to roll that back.  Otherwise we end up with e.g.
write(2) advancing position by more than the amount it reports having written.

Fixes: 182c25e9c157 "filemap: update ki_pos in generic_perform_write"

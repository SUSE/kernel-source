Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: reduce thermal limits on
 rk3399-pinephone-pro
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.15
Git-commit: 33e24f0738b922b6f5f4118dbdc26cac8400d7b9

[ Upstream commit 33e24f0738b922b6f5f4118dbdc26cac8400d7b9 ]

While this device uses the rk3399 it is also enclosed in a tight package
and cooled through the screen and back case. The default rk3399 thermal
limits can result in a burnt screen.

These lower limits have resulted in the existing burn not expanding and
will hopefully result in future devices not experiencing the issue.

Subject: [PATCH] clk: Don't parent clks until the parent is fully registered
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.11
Git-commit: 54baf56eaa40aa5cdcd02b3c20d593e4e1211220

[ Upstream commit 54baf56eaa40aa5cdcd02b3c20d593e4e1211220 ]

Before commit fc0c209c147f ("clk: Allow parents to be specified without
string names") child clks couldn't find their parent until the parent
clk was added to a list in __clk_core_init(). After that commit, child
clks can reference their parent clks directly via a clk_hw pointer, or
they can lookup that clk_hw pointer via DT if the parent clk is
registered with an OF clk provider.

The common clk framework treats hw->core being non-NULL as "the clk is
registered" per the logic within clk_core_fill_parent_index():

	parent = entry->hw->core;
	/*
	 * We have a direct reference but it isn't registered yet?
	 * Orphan it and let clk_reparent() update the orphan status
	 * when the parent is registered.
	 */
	if (!parent)

Therefore we need to be extra careful to not set hw->core until the clk
is fully registered with the clk framework. Otherwise we can get into a
situation where a child finds a parent clk and we move the child clk off
the orphan list when the parent isn't actually registered, wrecking our
enable accounting and breaking critical clks.

Consider the following scenario:

  CPU0                                     CPU1
  ----                                     ----
  struct clk_hw clkBad;
  struct clk_hw clkA;

  clkA.init.parent_hws = { &clkBad };

  clk_hw_register(&clkA)                   clk_hw_register(&clkBad)
   ...                                      __clk_register()
					     hw->core = core
					     ...
   __clk_register()
    __clk_core_init()
     clk_prepare_lock()
     __clk_init_parent()
      clk_core_get_parent_by_index()
       clk_core_fill_parent_index()
        if (entry->hw) {
	 parent = entry->hw->core;

At this point, 'parent' points to clkBad even though clkBad hasn't been
fully registered yet. Ouch! A similar problem can happen if a clk
controller registers orphan clks that are referenced in the DT node of
another clk controller.

Let's fix all this by only setting the hw->core pointer underneath the
clk prepare lock in __clk_core_init(). This way we know that
clk_core_fill_parent_index() can't see hw->core be non-NULL until the
clk is fully registered.

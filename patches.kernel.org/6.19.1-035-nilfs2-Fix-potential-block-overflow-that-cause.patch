Subject: [PATCH] nilfs2: Fix potential block overflow that cause system hang
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.1
Git-commit: ed527ef0c264e4bed6c7b2a158ddf516b17f5f66

commit ed527ef0c264e4bed6c7b2a158ddf516b17f5f66 upstream.

When a user executes the FITRIM command, an underflow can occur when
calculating nblocks if end_block is too small. Since nblocks is of
type sector_t, which is u64, a negative nblocks value will become a
very large positive integer. This ultimately leads to the block layer
function __blkdev_issue_discard() taking an excessively long time to
process the bio chain, and the ns_segctor_sem lock remains held for a
long period. This prevents other tasks from acquiring the ns_segctor_sem
lock, resulting in the hang reported by syzbot in [1].

If the ending block is too small, typically if it is smaller than 4KiB
range, depending on the usage of the segment 0, it may be possible to
attempt a discard request beyond the device size causing the hang.

Exiting successfully and assign the discarded size (0 in this case)
to range->len.

Although the start and len values in the user input range are too small,
a conservative strategy is adopted here to safely ignore them, which is
equivalent to a no-op; it will not perform any trimming and will not
throw an error.

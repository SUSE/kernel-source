Subject: [PATCH] serial: sh-sci: Increment the runtime usage counter for the
 earlycon device
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.5
Git-commit: 651dee03696e1dfde6d9a7e8664bbdcd9a10ea7f

[ Upstream commit 651dee03696e1dfde6d9a7e8664bbdcd9a10ea7f ]

In the sh-sci driver, serial ports are mapped to the sci_ports[] array,
with earlycon mapped at index zero.

The uart_add_one_port() function eventually calls __device_attach(),
which, in turn, calls pm_request_idle(). The identified code path is as
follows:

uart_add_one_port() ->
  serial_ctrl_register_port() ->
    serial_core_register_port() ->
      serial_core_port_device_add() ->
        serial_base_port_add() ->
          device_add() ->
            bus_probe_device() ->
              device_initial_probe() ->
                __device_attach() ->
                  // ...
                  if (dev->p->dead) {
                    // ...
                  } else if (dev->driver) {
                    // ...
                  } else {
                    // ...
                    pm_request_idle(dev);
                    // ...
                  }

The earlycon device clocks are enabled by the bootloader. However, the
pm_request_idle() call in __device_attach() disables the SCI port clocks
while earlycon is still active.

The earlycon write function, serial_console_write(), calls
sci_poll_put_char() via serial_console_putchar(). If the SCI port clocks
are disabled, writing to earlycon may sometimes cause the SR.TDFE bit to
remain unset indefinitely, causing the while loop in sci_poll_put_char()
to never exit. On single-core SoCs, this can result in the system being
blocked during boot when this issue occurs.

To resolve this, increment the runtime PM usage counter for the earlycon
SCI device before registering the UART port.

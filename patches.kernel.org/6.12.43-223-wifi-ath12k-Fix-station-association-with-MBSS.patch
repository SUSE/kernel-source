Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath12k: Fix station association with MBSSID Non-TX BSS
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.43
Git-commit: 70eeacc1a92a444f4b5777ab19e1c378a5edc8dd

[ Upstream commit 70eeacc1a92a444f4b5777ab19e1c378a5edc8dd ]

ath12k station is unable to associate with non-transmitting BSSes
in a Multiple BSS set because the user-space does not receive
information about the non-transmitting BSSes from mac80211's
scan results.

The ath12k driver does not advertise its MBSSID capability to mac80211,
resulting in wiphy->support_mbssid not being set. Consequently, the
information about non-transmitting BSS is not parsed from received
Beacon/Probe response frames and is therefore not included in the
scan results.

Fix this by advertising the MBSSID capability of ath12k driver to
mac80211.

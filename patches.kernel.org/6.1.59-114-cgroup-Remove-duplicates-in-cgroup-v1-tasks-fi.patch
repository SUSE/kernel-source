commit 1ca0b605150501b7dc59f3016271da4eb3e96fce upstream.

One PID may appear multiple times in a preloaded pidlist.
(Possibly due to PID recycling but we have reports of the same
task_struct appearing with different PIDs, thus possibly involving
transfer of PID via de_thread().)

Because v1 seq_file iterator uses PIDs as position, it leads to
a message:
> seq_file: buggy .next function kernfs_seq_next did not update position index

Conservative and quick fix consists of removing duplicates from `tasks`
file (as opposed to removing pidlists altogether). It doesn't affect
correctness (it's sufficient to show a PID once), performance impact
would be hidden by unconditional sorting of the pidlist already in place
(asymptotically).

Subject: [PATCH] orangefs: fix out-of-bounds fsid access
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.9
Git-commit: 53e4efa470d5fc6a96662d2d3322cfc925818517

[ Upstream commit 53e4efa470d5fc6a96662d2d3322cfc925818517 ]

Arnd Bergmann sent a patch to fsdevel, he says:

"orangefs_statfs() copies two consecutive fields of the superblock into
the statfs structure, which triggers a warning from the string fortification
helpers"

Jan Kara suggested an alternate way to do the patch to make it more readable.

I ran both ideas through xfstests and both seem fine. This patch
is based on Jan Kara's suggestion.

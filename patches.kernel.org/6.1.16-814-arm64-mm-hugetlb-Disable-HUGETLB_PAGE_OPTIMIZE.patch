Subject: [PATCH] arm64: mm: hugetlb: Disable HUGETLB_PAGE_OPTIMIZE_VMEMMAP
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 060a2c92d1b627c86c5c42ca69baf00457c00c5a

commit 060a2c92d1b627c86c5c42ca69baf00457c00c5a upstream.

Revert the HUGETLB_PAGE_FREE_VMEMMAP selection from commit 1e63ac088f20
("arm64: mm: hugetlb: enable HUGETLB_PAGE_FREE_VMEMMAP for arm64") but
keep the flush_dcache_page() compound_head() change as it aligns with
the corresponding check in the __sync_icache_dcache() function.

The original config option was renamed in commit 47010c040dec ("mm:
hugetlb_vmemmap: cleanup CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE_FREE_VMEMMAP*") to
HUGETLB_PAGE_OPTIMIZE_VMEMMAP and the flush_dcache_page() check was
further simplified by commit 2da1c30929a2 ("mm: hugetlb_vmemmap: delete
hugetlb_optimize_vmemmap_enabled()").

The reason for the revert is that the generic vmemmap_remap_pte()
function changes both the permissions (writeable to read-only) and the
output address (pfn) of the vmemmap ptes. This is deemed UNPREDICTABLE
by the Arm architecture without a break-before-make sequence (make the
PTE invalid, TLBI, write the new valid PTE). However, such sequence is
not possible since the vmemmap may be concurrently accessed by the
kernel. Disable the optimisation until a better solution is found.

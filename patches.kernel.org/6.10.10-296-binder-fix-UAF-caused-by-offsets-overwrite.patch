Subject: [PATCH] binder: fix UAF caused by offsets overwrite
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.10
Git-commit: 4df153652cc46545722879415937582028c18af5

commit 4df153652cc46545722879415937582028c18af5 upstream.

Binder objects are processed and copied individually into the target
buffer during transactions. Any raw data in-between these objects is
copied as well. However, this raw data copy lacks an out-of-bounds
check. If the raw data exceeds the data section size then the copy
overwrites the offsets section. This eventually triggers an error that
attempts to unwind the processed objects. However, at this point the
offsets used to index these objects are now corrupted.

Unwinding with corrupted offsets can result in decrements of arbitrary
nodes and lead to their premature release. Other users of such nodes are
left with a dangling pointer triggering a use-after-free. This issue is
made evident by the following KASAN report (trimmed):

  ==================================================================

To avoid this issue, let's check that the raw data copy is within the
boundaries of the data section.

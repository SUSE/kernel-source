Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86/mmu: Drop RWX=0 SPTEs during ept_sync_page()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 9fb3565743d58352f00964bf47213b88aff4bb82

[ Upstream commit 9fb3565743d58352f00964bf47213b88aff4bb82 ]

All of sync_page()'s existing checks filter out only !PRESENT gPTE,
because without execute-only, all upper levels are guaranteed to be at
least READABLE.  However, if EPT with execute-only support is in use by
L1, KVM can create an SPTE that is shadow-present but guest-inaccessible
(RWX=0) if the upper level combined permissions are R (or RW) and
the leaf EPTE is changed from R (or RW) to X.  Because the EPTE is
considered present when viewed in isolation, and no reserved bits are set,
FNAME(prefetch_invalid_gpte) will consider the GPTE valid, and cause a
not-present SPTE to be created.

The SPTE is "correct": the guest translation is inaccessible because
the combined protections of all levels yield RWX=0, and KVM will just
redirect any vmexits to the guest.  If EPT A/D bits are disabled, KVM
can mistake the SPTE for an access-tracked SPTE, but again such confusion
isn't fatal, as the "saved" protections are also RWX=0.  However,
creating a useless SPTE in general means that KVM messed up something,
even if this particular goof didn't manifest as a functional bug.
So, drop SPTEs whose new protections will yield a RWX=0 SPTE, and
add a WARN in make_spte() to detect creation of SPTEs that will
result in RWX=0 protections.

Subject: [PATCH] libbpf: restore memory layout of bpf_object_open_opts
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: dbdea9b36fb61da3b9a1be0dd63542e2bfd3e5d7

[ Upstream commit dbdea9b36fb61da3b9a1be0dd63542e2bfd3e5d7 ]

When attach_prog_fd field was removed in libbpf 1.0 and replaced with
`long: 0` placeholder, it actually shifted all the subsequent fields by
8 byte. This is due to `long: 0` promising to adjust next field's offset
to long-aligned offset. But in this case we were already long-aligned
as pin_root_path is a pointer. So `long: 0` had no effect, and thus
didn't feel the gap created by removed attach_prog_fd.

Non-zero bitfield should have been used instead. I validated using
pahole. Originally kconfig field was at offset 40. With `long: 0` it's
at offset 32, which is wrong. With this change it's back at offset 40.

While technically libbpf 1.0 is allowed to break backwards
compatibility and applications should have been recompiled against
libbpf 1.0 headers, but given how trivial it is to preserve memory
layout, let's fix this.

Subject: [PATCH] sparc: fix old compat_sys_select()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.8
Git-commit: bae6428a9fffb2023191b0723e276cf1377a7c9f

[ Upstream commit bae6428a9fffb2023191b0723e276cf1377a7c9f ]

sparc has two identical select syscalls at numbers 93 and 230, respectively.
During the conversion to the modern syscall.tbl format, the older one of the
two broke in compat mode, and now refers to the native 64-bit syscall.

Restore the correct behavior. This has very little effect, as glibc has
been using the newer number anyway.

Fixes: 6ff645dd683a ("sparc: add system call table generation support")

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "powerpc: Remove unused FW_FEATURE_NATIVE references"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.8
Git-commit: 310d1344e3c58cc2d625aa4e52cfcb7d8a26fcbf

commit 310d1344e3c58cc2d625aa4e52cfcb7d8a26fcbf upstream.

This reverts commit 79b74a68486765a4fe685ac4069bc71366c538f5.

It broke booting on IBM Cell machines when the kernel is also built with
CONFIG_PPC_PS3=y.

That's because FW_FEATURE_NATIVE_ALWAYS = 0 does have an important
effect, which is to clear the PS3 ALWAYS features from
FW_FEATURE_ALWAYS.

Note that CONFIG_PPC_NATIVE has since been renamed
CONFIG_PPC_HASH_MMU_NATIVE.

[ Upstream commit cf0b812500e64a7d5e2957abed38c3a97917b34f ]

It turns out that the Windows WMI-ACPI driver always enables/disables
WMI events regardless of whether they are marked as expensive or not.
This finding is further reinforced when reading the documentation of
the WMI_FUNCTION_CONTROL_CALLBACK callback used by Windows drivers
for enabling/disabling WMI devices:

	The DpWmiFunctionControl routine enables or disables
	notification of events, and enables or disables data
	collection for data blocks that the driver registered
	as expensive to collect.

Follow this behavior to fix the WMI event used for reporting hotkey
events on the Dell Latitude 5400 and likely many more devices.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rk3399-puma eMMC HS400 signal
 integrity
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.16
Git-commit: 62966cbdda8a92f82d966a45aa671e788b2006f7

[ Upstream commit 62966cbdda8a92f82d966a45aa671e788b2006f7 ]

There are signal integrity issues running the eMMC at 200MHz on Puma
RK3399-Q7.

Similar to the work-around found for RK3399 Gru boards, lowering the
frequency to 100MHz made the eMMC much more stable, so let's lower the
frequency to 100MHz.

It might be possible to run at 150MHz as on RK3399 Gru boards but only
100MHz was extensively tested.

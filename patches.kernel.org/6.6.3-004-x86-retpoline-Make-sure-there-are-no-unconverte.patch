Subject: [PATCH] x86/retpoline: Make sure there are no unconverted return
 thunks due to KCSAN
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.3

[ Upstream commit 2d7ce49f58dc95495b3e22e45d2be7de909b2c63 ]

Enabling CONFIG_KCSAN leads to unconverted, default return thunks to
remain after patching.

As David Kaplan describes in his debugging of the issue, it is caused by
a couple of KCSAN-generated constructors which aren't processed by
objtool:

  "When KCSAN is enabled, GCC generates lots of constructor functions
  named _sub_I_00099_0 which call __tsan_init and then return.  The
  returns in these are generally annotated normally by objtool and fixed
  up at runtime.  But objtool runs on vmlinux.o and vmlinux.o does not
  include a couple of object files that are in vmlinux, like
  init/version-timestamp.o and .vmlinux.export.o, both of which contain
  _sub_I_00099_0 functions.  As a result, the returns in these functions
  are not annotated, and the panic occurs when we call one of them in
  do_ctors and it uses the default return thunk.

  This difference can be seen by counting the number of these functions in the object files:
  $ objdump -d vmlinux.o|grep -c "<_sub_I_00099_0>:"
  2601
  $ objdump -d vmlinux|grep -c "<_sub_I_00099_0>:"
  2603

  If these functions are only run during kernel boot, there is no
  speculation concern."

Fix it by disabling KCSAN on version-timestamp.o and .vmlinux.export.o
so the extra functions don't get generated.  KASAN and GCOV are already
disabled for those files.

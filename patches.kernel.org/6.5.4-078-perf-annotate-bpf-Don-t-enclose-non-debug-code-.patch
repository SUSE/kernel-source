[ Upstream commit 979e9c9fc9c2a761303585e07fe2699bdd88182f ]

In 616b14b47a86d880 ("perf build: Conditionally define NDEBUG") we
started using NDEBUG=1 when DEBUG=1 isn't present, so code that is
enclosed with assert() is not called.

In dd317df072071903 ("perf build: Make binutil libraries opt in") we
stopped linking against binutils-devel, for licensing reasons.

Recently people asked me why annotation of BPF programs wasn't working,
i.e. this:

  $ perf annotate bpf_prog_5280546344e3f45c_kfree_skb

was returning:

  case SYMBOL_ANNOTATE_ERRNO__NO_LIBOPCODES_FOR_BPF:
     scnprintf(buf, buflen, "Please link with binutils's libopcode to enable BPF annotation");

This was on a fedora rpm, so its new enough that I had to try to test by
rebuilding using BUILD_NONDISTRO=1, only to get it segfaulting on me.

This combination made this libopcode function not to be called:

        assert(bfd_check_format(bfdf, bfd_object));

Changing it to:

	if (!bfd_check_format(bfdf, bfd_object))
		abort();

Made it work, looking at this "check" function made me realize it
changes the 'bfdf' internal state, i.e. we better call it.

So stop using assert() on it, just call it and abort if it fails.

Probably it is better to propagate the error, etc, but it seems it is
unlikely to fail from the usage done so far and we really need to stop
using libopcodes, so do the quick fix above and move on.

With it we have BPF annotation back working when built with
BUILD_NONDISTRO=1:

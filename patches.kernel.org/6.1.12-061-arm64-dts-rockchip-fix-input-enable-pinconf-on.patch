Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix input enable pinconf on rk3399
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.12
Git-commit: 6f515b663d49a14fb63f8c5d0a2a4ae53d44790a

[ Upstream commit 6f515b663d49a14fb63f8c5d0a2a4ae53d44790a ]

When the input enable pinconf was introduced, a default drive-strength
value of 2 was set for the pull up/down configs. However, this parameter
is unneeded when configuring the pin as input, and having a single
hardcoded value here is actually harmful: GPIOs on the RK3399 have
various same drive-strength capabilities depending on the bank and port
they belong to.

As an example, trying to configure the GPIO4_PD3 pin as an input with
pull-up enabled fails with the following output:

  [   10.706542] rockchip-pinctrl pinctrl: unsupported driver strength 2
  [   10.713661] rockchip-pinctrl pinctrl: pin_config_set op failed for pin 155

(acceptable drive-strength values for this pin being 3, 6, 9 and 12)

Let's drop the drive-strength property from all input pinconfs in order
to solve this issue.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: PM: s2idle: Cancel wakeup before dispatching EC GPE
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.10
Git-commit: dc0075ba7f387fe4c48a8c674b11ab6f374a6acc

[ Upstream commit dc0075ba7f387fe4c48a8c674b11ab6f374a6acc ]

Commit 4a9af6cac050 ("ACPI: EC: Rework flushing of EC work while
suspended to idle") made acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe() check
pm_wakeup_pending(), but that is before canceling the SCI wakeup,
so pm_wakeup_pending() is always true.  This causes the loop in
acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe() to always terminate after one iteration which
may not be correct.

Address this issue by canceling the SCI wakeup earlier, from
acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe() itself.

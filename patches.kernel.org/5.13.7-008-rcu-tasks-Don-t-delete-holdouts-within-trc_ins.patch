Subject: [PATCH] rcu-tasks: Don't delete holdouts within trc_inspect_reader()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.7
Git-commit: 1d10bf55d85d34eb73dd8263635f43fd72135d2d

[ Upstream commit 1d10bf55d85d34eb73dd8263635f43fd72135d2d ]

As Yanfei pointed out, although invoking trc_del_holdout() is safe
from the viewpoint of the integrity of the holdout list itself,
the put_task_struct() invoked by trc_del_holdout() can result in
use-after-free errors due to later accesses to this task_struct structure
by the RCU Tasks Trace grace-period kthread.

This commit therefore removes this call to trc_del_holdout() from
trc_inspect_reader() in favor of the grace-period thread's existing call
to trc_del_holdout(), thus eliminating that particular class of
use-after-free errors.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: PM: Add acpi_device_fix_up_power_children() function
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.4
Git-commit: 37ba91a82e3b9de35f64348c62b5ec7d74e3a41c

commit 37ba91a82e3b9de35f64348c62b5ec7d74e3a41c upstream.

In some cases it is necessary to fix-up the power-state of an ACPI
device's children without touching the ACPI device itself add
a new acpi_device_fix_up_power_children() function for this.

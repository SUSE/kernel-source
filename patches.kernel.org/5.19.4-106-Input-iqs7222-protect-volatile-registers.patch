Subject: [PATCH] Input: iqs7222 - protect volatile registers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.4
Git-commit: 1e4189d8af2749e2db406f92bdc4abccbab63138

commit 1e4189d8af2749e2db406f92bdc4abccbab63138 upstream.

Select variants of silicon silently mirror part of the event mask
register to the system setup register (0xD0), and vice versa. For
the following sequence:

1. Read registers 0xD0 onward and store their contents.
2. Modify the contents, including event mask fields.
3. Write registers 0xD0 onward with the modified contents.
4. Write register 0xD0 on its own again later, using the contents
   from step 1 to populate any reserved fields.

...the event mask register (e.g. address 0xDA) has been corrupted
by writing register 0xD0 with contents that were made stale after
step 3.

To solve this problem, read register 0xD0 once more between steps
3 and 4. When register 0xD0 is written during step 4, the portion
which is mirrored to the event mask register already matches what
was written in step 3.

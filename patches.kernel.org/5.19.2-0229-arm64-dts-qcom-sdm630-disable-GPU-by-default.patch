Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm630: disable GPU by default
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 1c047919763b4548381d1ab3320af1df66ab83df

[ Upstream commit 1c047919763b4548381d1ab3320af1df66ab83df ]

The SoC's device tree file disables gpucc and adreno's SMMU by default.
So let's disable the GPU too. Moreover it looks like SMMU might be not
usable without additional patches (which means that GPU is unusable
too). No board uses GPU at this moment.

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: qcom: Disable ASPM L0s for X1E80100
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.4
Git-commit: fba6045161d686adc102b6ef71b2fd1e5f90a616

commit fba6045161d686adc102b6ef71b2fd1e5f90a616 upstream.

Currently, the cfg_1_9_0 which is being used for X1E80100 doesn't disable
ASPM L0s. However, hardware team recommends to disable L0s as the PHY init
sequence is not tuned support L0s. Hence reuse cfg_sc8280xp for X1E80100.

Note that the config_sid() callback is not present in cfg_sc8280xp, don't
concern about this because config_sid() callback is originally a no-op
for X1E80100.

Fixes: 6d0c39324c5f ("PCI: qcom: Add X1E80100 PCIe support")

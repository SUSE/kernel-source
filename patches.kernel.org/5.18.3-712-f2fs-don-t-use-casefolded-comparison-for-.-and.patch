Subject: [PATCH] f2fs: don't use casefolded comparison for "." and ".."
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: b5639bb4313b9d455fc9fc4768d23a5e4ca8cb9d

commit b5639bb4313b9d455fc9fc4768d23a5e4ca8cb9d upstream.

Tryng to rename a directory that has all following properties fails with
EINVAL and triggers the 'WARN_ON_ONCE(!fscrypt_has_encryption_key(dir))'
in f2fs_match_ci_name():

    - The directory is casefolded
    - The directory is encrypted
    - The directory's encryption key is not yet set up
    - The parent directory is *not* encrypted

The problem is incorrect handling of the lookup of ".." to get the
parent reference to update.  fscrypt_setup_filename() treats ".." (and
".") specially, as it's never encrypted.  It's passed through as-is, and
setting up the directory's key is not attempted.  As the name isn't a
no-key name, f2fs treats it as a "normal" name and attempts a casefolded
comparison.  That breaks the assumption of the WARN_ON_ONCE() in
f2fs_match_ci_name() which assumes that for encrypted directories,
casefolded comparisons only happen when the directory's key is set up.

We could just remove this WARN_ON_ONCE().  However, since casefolding is
always a no-op on "." and ".." anyway, let's instead just not casefold
these names.  This results in the standard bytewise comparison.

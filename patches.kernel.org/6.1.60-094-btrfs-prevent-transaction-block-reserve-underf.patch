Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: prevent transaction block reserve underflow when
 starting transaction
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.60
Git-commit: a7ddeeb079505961355cf0106154da0110f1fdff

[ Upstream commit a7ddeeb079505961355cf0106154da0110f1fdff ]

When starting a transaction, with a non-zero number of items, we reserve
metadata space for that number of items and for delayed refs by doing a
call to btrfs_block_rsv_add(), with the transaction block reserve passed
as the block reserve argument. This reserves metadata space and adds it
to the transaction block reserve. Later we migrate the space we reserved
for delayed references from the transaction block reserve into the delayed
refs block reserve, by calling btrfs_migrate_to_delayed_refs_rsv().

btrfs_migrate_to_delayed_refs_rsv() decrements the number of bytes to
migrate from the source block reserve, and this however may result in an
underflow in case the space added to the transaction block reserve ended
up being used by another task that has not reserved enough space for its
own use - examples are tasks doing reflinks or hole punching because they
end up calling btrfs_replace_file_extents() -> btrfs_drop_extents() and
may need to modify/COW a variable number of leaves/paths, so they keep
trying to use space from the transaction block reserve when they need to
COW an extent buffer, and may end up trying to use more space then they
have reserved (1 unit/path only for removing file extent items).

This can be avoided by simply reserving space first without adding it to
the transaction block reserve, then add the space for delayed refs to the
delayed refs block reserve and finally add the remaining reserved space
to the transaction block reserve. This also makes the code a bit shorter
and simpler. So just do that.

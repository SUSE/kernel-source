Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: qcom: check for outanding writes before doing a
 read
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.9
Git-commit: 49a467310dc4fae591a3547860ee04d8730780f4

[ Upstream commit 49a467310dc4fae591a3547860ee04d8730780f4 ]

Reading will increase the fifo count, so check for outstanding cmd wrt.
write fifo depth to avoid overflow as read will also increase
write fifo cnt.

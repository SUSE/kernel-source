Subject: [PATCH] iavf: Fix issue with MAC address of VF shown as zero
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.6
Git-commit: 645603844270b69175899268be68b871295764fe

[ Upstream commit 645603844270b69175899268be68b871295764fe ]

After reinitialization of iavf, ice driver gets VIRTCHNL_OP_ADD_ETH_ADDR
message with incorrectly set type of MAC address. Hardware address should
have is_primary flag set as true. This way ice driver knows what it has
to set as a MAC address.

Check if the address is primary in iavf_add_filter function and set flag
accordingly.

To test set all-zero MAC on a VF. This triggers iavf re-initialization
and VIRTCHNL_OP_ADD_ETH_ADDR message gets sent to PF.
For example:

ip link set dev ens785 vf 0 mac 00:00:00:00:00:00

This triggers re-initialization of iavf. New MAC should be assigned.
Now check if MAC is non-zero:

ip link show dev ens785

Fixes: a3e839d539e0 ("iavf: Add usage of new virtchnl format to set default MAC")

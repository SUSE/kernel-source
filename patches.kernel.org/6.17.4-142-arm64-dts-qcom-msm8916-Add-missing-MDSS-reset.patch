Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Add missing MDSS reset
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.4
Git-commit: 99b78773c2ae55dcc01025f94eae8ce9700ae985

commit 99b78773c2ae55dcc01025f94eae8ce9700ae985 upstream.

On most MSM8916 devices (aside from the DragonBoard 410c), the bootloader
already initializes the display to show the boot splash screen. In this
situation, MDSS is already configured and left running when starting Linux.
To avoid side effects from the bootloader configuration, the MDSS reset can
be specified in the device tree to start again with a clean hardware state.

The reset for MDSS is currently missing in msm8916.dtsi, which causes
errors when the MDSS driver tries to re-initialize the registers:

 dsi_err_worker: status=6
 dsi_err_worker: status=6
 dsi_err_worker: status=6
 ...

It turns out that we have always indirectly worked around this by building
the MDSS driver as a module. Before v6.17, the power domain was temporarily
turned off until the module was loaded, long enough to clear the register
contents. In v6.17, power domains are not turned off during boot until
sync_state() happens, so this is no longer working. Even before v6.17 this
resulted in broken behavior, but notably only when the MDSS driver was
built-in instead of a module.

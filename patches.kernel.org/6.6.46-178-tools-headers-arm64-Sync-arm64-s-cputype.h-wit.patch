Subject: [PATCH] tools headers arm64: Sync arm64's cputype.h with the kernel
 sources
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.46
Git-commit: dc6abbbde4b099e936cd5428e196d86a5e119aae

commit dc6abbbde4b099e936cd5428e196d86a5e119aae upstream.

To get the changes in:

  0ce85db6c2141b7f ("arm64: cputype: Add Neoverse-V3 definitions")
  02a0a04676fa7796 ("arm64: cputype: Add Cortex-X4 definitions")
  f4d9d9dcc70b96b5 ("arm64: Add Neoverse-V2 part")

That makes this perf source code to be rebuilt:

  CC      /tmp/build/perf-tools/util/arm-spe.o

The changes in the above patch add MIDR_NEOVERSE_V[23] and
MIDR_NEOVERSE_V1 is used in arm-spe.c, so probably we need to add those
and perhaps MIDR_CORTEX_X4 to that array? Or maybe we need to leave this
for later when this is all tested on those machines?

  static const struct midr_range neoverse_spe[] = {
          MIDR_ALL_VERSIONS(MIDR_NEOVERSE_N1),
          MIDR_ALL_VERSIONS(MIDR_NEOVERSE_N2),
          MIDR_ALL_VERSIONS(MIDR_NEOVERSE_V1),
          {},
  };

Mark Rutland recommended about arm-spe.c:

"I would not touch this for now -- someone would have to go audit the
TRMs to check that those other cores have the same encoding, and I think
it'd be better to do that as a follow-up."

That addresses this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header differences:
    diff -u tools/arch/arm64/include/asm/cputype.h arch/arm64/include/asm/cputype.h

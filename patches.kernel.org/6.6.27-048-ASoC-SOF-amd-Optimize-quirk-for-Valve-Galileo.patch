Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: amd: Optimize quirk for Valve Galileo
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.27
Git-commit: a13f0c3c0e8fb3e61fbfd99c6b350cf9be0c4660

[ Upstream commit a13f0c3c0e8fb3e61fbfd99c6b350cf9be0c4660 ]

Valve's Steam Deck OLED is uniquely identified by vendor and product
name (Galileo) DMI fields.

Simplify the quirk by removing the unnecessary match on product family.

Additionally, fix the related comment as it points to the old product
variant.

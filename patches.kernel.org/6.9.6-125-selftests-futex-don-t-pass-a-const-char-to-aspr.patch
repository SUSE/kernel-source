Subject: [PATCH] selftests/futex: don't pass a const char* to asprintf(3)
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.6
Git-commit: 4bf15b1c657d22d1d70173e43264e4606dfe75ff

[ Upstream commit 4bf15b1c657d22d1d70173e43264e4606dfe75ff ]

When building with clang, via:

    make LLVM=1 -C tools/testing/selftests

...clang issues this warning:

futex_requeue_pi.c:403:17: warning: passing 'const char **' to parameter
of type 'char **' discards qualifiers in nested pointer types
[-Wincompatible-pointer-types-discards-qualifiers]

This warning fires because test_name is passed into asprintf(3), which
then changes it.

Fix this by simply removing the const qualifier. This is a local
automatic variable in a very short function, so there is not much need
to use the compiler to enforce const-ness at this scope.

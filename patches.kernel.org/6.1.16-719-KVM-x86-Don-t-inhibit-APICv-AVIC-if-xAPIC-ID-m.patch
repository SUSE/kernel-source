Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Don't inhibit APICv/AVIC if xAPIC ID mismatch is
 due to 32-bit ID
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: f651a008954803d7bb2d85b7042d0fd46133d782

commit f651a008954803d7bb2d85b7042d0fd46133d782 upstream.

Truncate the vcpu_id, a.k.a. x2APIC ID, to an 8-bit value when comparing
it against the xAPIC ID to avoid false positives (sort of) on systems
with >255 CPUs, i.e. with IDs that don't fit into a u8.  The intent of
APIC_ID_MODIFIED is to inhibit APICv/AVIC when the xAPIC is changed from
it's original value,

The mismatch isn't technically a false positive, as architecturally the
xAPIC IDs do end up being aliased in this scenario, and neither APICv
nor AVIC correctly handles IPI virtualization when there is aliasing.
However, KVM already deliberately does not honor the aliasing behavior
that results when an x2APIC ID gets truncated to an xAPIC ID.  I.e. the
resulting APICv/AVIC behavior is aligned with KVM's existing behavior
when KVM's x2APIC hotplug hack is effectively enabled.

If/when KVM provides a way to disable the hotplug hack, APICv/AVIC can
piggyback whatever logic disables the optimized APIC map (which is what
provides the hotplug hack), i.e. so that KVM's optimized map and APIC
virtualization yield the same behavior.

For now, fix the immediate problem of APIC virtualization being disabled
for large VMs, which is a much more pressing issue than ensuring KVM
honors architectural behavior for APIC ID aliasing.

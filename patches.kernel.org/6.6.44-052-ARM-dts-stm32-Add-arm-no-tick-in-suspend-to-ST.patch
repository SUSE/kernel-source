Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: Add arm,no-tick-in-suspend to STM32MP15xx
 STGEN timer
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.44
Git-commit: 4306c047415a227bc72f0e7ba9bde1ccdac10435

[ Upstream commit 4306c047415a227bc72f0e7ba9bde1ccdac10435 ]

STM32MP15xx RM0436 Rev 6 section 46.3 System timer generator (STGEN) states
"
Arm recommends that the system counter is in an always-on power domain.
This is not supported in the current implementation, therefore STGEN should
be saved and restored before Standby mode entry, and restored at Standby
exit by secure software.
...
"
Instead of piling up workarounds in the firmware which is difficult to
update, add "arm,no-tick-in-suspend" DT property into the timer node to
indicate the timer is stopped in suspend, and let the kernel fix the
timer up.

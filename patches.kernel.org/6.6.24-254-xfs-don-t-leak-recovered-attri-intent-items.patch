Subject: [PATCH] xfs: don't leak recovered attri intent items
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.24
Git-commit: 07bcbdf020c9fd3c14bec51c50225a2a02707b94

commit 07bcbdf020c9fd3c14bec51c50225a2a02707b94 upstream.

If recovery finds an xattr log intent item calling for the removal of an
attribute and the file doesn't even have an attr fork, we know that the
removal is trivially complete.  However, we can't just exit the recovery
function without doing something about the recovered log intent item --
it's still on the AIL, and not logging an attrd item means it stays
there forever.

This has likely not been seen in practice because few people use LARP
and the runtime code won't log the attri for a no-attrfork removexattr
operation.  But let's fix this anyway.

Also we shouldn't really be testing the attr fork presence until we've
taken the ILOCK, though this doesn't matter much in recovery, which is
single threaded.

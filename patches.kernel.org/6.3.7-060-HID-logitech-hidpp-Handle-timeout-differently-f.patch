Subject: [PATCH] HID: logitech-hidpp: Handle timeout differently from busy
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.7
Git-commit: 6199d23c91ce53bfed455f09a8c5ed170d516824

[ Upstream commit 6199d23c91ce53bfed455f09a8c5ed170d516824 ]

If an attempt at contacting a receiver or a device fails because the
receiver or device never responds, don't restart the communication, only
restart it if the receiver or device answers that it's busy, as originally
intended.

This was the behaviour on communication timeout before commit 586e8fede795
("HID: logitech-hidpp: Retry commands when device is busy").

This fixes some overly long waits in a critical path on boot, when
checking whether the device is connected by getting its HID++ version.

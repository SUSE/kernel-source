Subject: [PATCH] attach_recursive_mnt(): do not lock the covering tree when
 sliding something under it
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.36
Git-commit: ce7df19686530920f2f6b636e71ce5eb1d9303ef

[ Upstream commit ce7df19686530920f2f6b636e71ce5eb1d9303ef ]

If we are propagating across the userns boundary, we need to lock the
mounts added there.  However, in case when something has already
been mounted there and we end up sliding a new tree under that,
the stuff that had been there before should not get locked.

IOW, lock_mnt_tree() should be called before we reparent the
preexisting tree on top of what we are adding.

Fixes: 3bd045cc9c4b ("separate copying and locking mount tree on cross-userns copies")

Subject: [PATCH] scsi: lpfc: Fix queue failures when recovering from PCI
 parity error
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.4
Git-commit: df0101197c4d9596682901631f3ee193ed354873

[ Upstream commit df0101197c4d9596682901631f3ee193ed354873 ]

When recovering from a pci-parity error the driver is failing to re-create
queues, causing recovery to fail. Looking deeper, it was found that the
interrupt vector count allocated on the recovery was fewer than the vectors
originally allocated. This disparity resulted in CPU map entries with stale
information. When the driver tries to re-create the queues, it attempts to
use the stale information which indicates an eq/interrupt vector that was
no longer created.

Fix by clearng the cpup map array before enabling and requesting the IRQs
in the lpfc_sli_reset_slot_s4 routine().

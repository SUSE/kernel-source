Subject: [PATCH] net: stmmac: socfpga: remove phy_resume() call
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.5
Git-commit: 366aeeba79088003307f0f12bb3575fb083cc72a

commit 366aeeba79088003307f0f12bb3575fb083cc72a upstream.

As the previous commit addressed DWGMAC resuming with a PHY in
suspended state, there is now no need for socfpga to work around
this. Remove this code.

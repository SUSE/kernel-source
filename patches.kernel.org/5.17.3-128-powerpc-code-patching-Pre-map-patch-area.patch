[ Upstream commit 591b4b268435f00d2f0b81f786c2c7bd5ef66416 ]

Paul reported a warning with DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/sched/mm.h:256

Peter pointed out that this is because do_patch_instruction() has
disabled interrupts, but then map_patch_area() calls map_kernel_page()
then hash__map_kernel_page() which does a sleeping memory allocation.

We only see the warning in KVM guests with SMT enabled, which is not
particularly common, or on other platforms if CONFIG_KPROBES is
disabled, also not common. The reason we don't see it in most
configurations is that another path that happens to have interrupts
enabled has allocated the required page tables for us, eg. there's a
path in kprobes init that does that. That's just pure luck though.

As Christophe suggested, the simplest solution is to do a dummy
map/unmap when we initialise the patching, so that any required page
table levels are pre-allocated before the first call to
do_patch_instruction(). This works because the unmap doesn't free any
page tables that were allocated by the map, it just clears the PTE,
leaving the page table levels there for the next map.

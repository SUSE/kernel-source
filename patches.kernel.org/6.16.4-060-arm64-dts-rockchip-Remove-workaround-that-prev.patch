Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Remove workaround that prevented Turing
 RK1 GPU power regulator control
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.4
Git-commit: de5b39d16318f9345f1ba7c1b684ba0c1cb6fdad

commit de5b39d16318f9345f1ba7c1b684ba0c1cb6fdad upstream.

The RK3588 GPU power domain cannot be activated unless the external
power regulator is already on. When GPU support was added to this DT,
we had no way to represent this requirement, so `regulator-always-on`
was added to the `vdd_gpu_s0` regulator in order to ensure stability.
A later patch series (see "Fixes:" commit) resolved this shortcoming,
but that commit left the workaround -- and rendered the comment above
it no longer correct.

Remove the workaround to allow the GPU power regulator to power off, now
that the DT includes the necessary information to power it back on
correctly.

Fixes: f94500eb7328b ("arm64: dts: rockchip: Add GPU power domain regulator dependency for RK3588")

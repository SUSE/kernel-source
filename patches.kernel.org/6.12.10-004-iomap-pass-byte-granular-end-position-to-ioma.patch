Subject: [PATCH] iomap: pass byte granular end position to iomap_add_to_ioend
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.10
Git-commit: b44679c63e4d3ac820998b6bd59fba89a72ad3e7

[ Upstream commit b44679c63e4d3ac820998b6bd59fba89a72ad3e7 ]

This is a preparatory patch for fixing zero padding issues in concurrent
append write scenarios. In the following patches, we need to obtain
byte-granular writeback end position for io_size trimming after EOF
handling.

Due to concurrent writeback and truncate operations, inode size may
shrink. Resampling inode size would force writeback code to handle the
newly appeared post-EOF blocks, which is undesirable. As Dave
explained in [1]:

"Really, the issue is that writeback mappings have to be able to
handle the range being mapped suddenly appear to be beyond EOF.
This behaviour is a longstanding writeback constraint, and is what
iomap_writepage_handle_eof() is attempting to handle.

We handle this by only sampling i_size_read() whilst we have the
folio locked and can determine the action we should take with that
folio (i.e. nothing, partial zeroing, or skip altogether). Once
we've made the decision that the folio is within EOF and taken
action on it (i.e. moved the folio to writeback state), we cannot
then resample the inode size because a truncate may have started
and changed the inode size."

To avoid resampling inode size after EOF handling, we convert end_pos
to byte-granular writeback position and return it from EOF handling
function.

Since iomap_set_range_dirty() can handle unaligned lengths, this
conversion has no impact on it. However, iomap_find_dirty_range()
requires aligned start and end range to find dirty blocks within the
given range, so the end position needs to be rounded up when passed
to it.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: bpf: Only mitigate cBPF programs loaded by
 unprivileged users
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.29
Git-commit: f300769ead032513a68e4a02e806393402e626f8

commit f300769ead032513a68e4a02e806393402e626f8 upstream.

Support for eBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users is typically
disabled. This means only cBPF programs need to be mitigated for BHB.

In addition, only mitigate cBPF programs that were loaded by an
unprivileged user. Privileged users can also load the same program
via eBPF, making the mitigation pointless.

Subject: [PATCH] team: Fix feature exposure when no ports are present
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.7
Git-commit: e78c20f327bd94dabac68b98218dff069a8780f0

[ Upstream commit e78c20f327bd94dabac68b98218dff069a8780f0 ]

Small follow-up to align this to an equivalent behavior as the bond driver.
The change in 3625920b62c3 ("teaming: fix vlan_features computing") removed
the netdevice vlan_features when there is no team port attached, yet it
leaves the full set of enc_features intact.

Instead, leave the default features as pre 3625920b62c3, and recompute once
we do have ports attached. Also, similarly as in bonding case, call the
netdev_base_features() helper on the enc_features.

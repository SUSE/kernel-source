Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtlwifi: rtl8192du: Don't claim USB ID 0bda:8171
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.7
Git-commit: a95d28a8a2f76c591a195c06ea15f5b15c66c3d1

commit a95d28a8a2f76c591a195c06ea15f5b15c66c3d1 upstream.

This ID appears to be RTL8188SU, not RTL8192DU. This is the wrong driver
for RTL8188SU. The r8712u driver from staging handles this ID.

I think this ID comes from the original rtl8192du driver from Realtek.
I don't know if they added it by mistake, or it was actually used for
two different chips.

RTL8188SU with this ID exists in the wild. RTL8192DU with this ID
probably doesn't.

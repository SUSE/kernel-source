Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/dp: Clear VSC SDP during post ddi disable routine
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.7
Git-commit: 3e307d6c28e7bc7d94b5699d0ed7fe07df6db094

commit 3e307d6c28e7bc7d94b5699d0ed7fe07df6db094 upstream.

Clear VSC SDP if intel_dp_set_infoframes is called from post ddi disable
routine i.e with the variable of enable as false. This is to avoid
an infoframes.enable mismatch issue which is caused when pipe is
connected to eDp which has psr then connected to DPMST. In this case
eDp's post ddi disable routine does not clear infoframes.enable VSC
for the given pipe and DPMST does not recompute VSC SDP and write
infoframes.enable which causes a mismatch.

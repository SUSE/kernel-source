Subject: [PATCH] wifi: wilc1000: Do not operate uninitialized hardware during

[ Upstream commit b0dc7018477e8fbb7e40c908c29cf663d06b17a7 ]

In case the hardware is not initialized, do not operate it during
suspend/resume cycle, the hardware is already off so there is no
reason to access it.

In fact, wilc_sdio_enable_interrupt() in the resume callback does
interfere with the same call when initializing the hardware after
resume and makes such initialization after resume fail. Fix this
by not operating uninitialized hardware during suspend/resume.

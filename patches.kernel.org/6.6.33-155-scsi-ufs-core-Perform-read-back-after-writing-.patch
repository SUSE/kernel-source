Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ufs: core: Perform read back after writing
 UTP_TASK_REQ_LIST_BASE_H
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.33
Git-commit: 408e28086f1c7a6423efc79926a43d7001902fae

[ Upstream commit 408e28086f1c7a6423efc79926a43d7001902fae ]

Currently, the UTP_TASK_REQ_LIST_BASE_L/UTP_TASK_REQ_LIST_BASE_H regs are
written to and then completed with an mb().

mb() ensures that the write completes, but completion doesn't mean that it
isn't stored in a buffer somewhere. The recommendation for ensuring these
bits have taken effect on the device is to perform a read back to force it
to make it all the way to the device. This is documented in device-io.rst
and a talk by Will Deacon on this can be seen over here:

    https://youtu.be/i6DayghhA8Q?si=MiyxB5cKJXSaoc01&t=1678

Let's do that to ensure the bits hit the device. Because the mb()'s purpose
wasn't to add extra ordering (on top of the ordering guaranteed by
writel()/readl()), it can safely be removed.

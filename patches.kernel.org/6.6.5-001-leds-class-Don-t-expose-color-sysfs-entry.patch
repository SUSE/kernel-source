Git-commit: 8f2244c9af245ff72185c0473827125ee6b2d1a5

commit 8f2244c9af245ff72185c0473827125ee6b2d1a5 upstream.

The commit c7d80059b086 ("leds: class: Store the color index in struct
led_classdev") introduced a new sysfs entry "color" that is commonly
created for the led classdev.  Unfortunately, this conflicts with the
"color" sysfs entry of already existing drivers such as Logitech HID
or System76 ACPI drivers.  The driver probe fails due to the conflict,
hence it leads to a severe regression with the missing keyboard, for
example.

This patch reverts partially the change in the commit above for
removing the led class color sysfs entries again for addressing the
regressions.  The newly introduced led_classdev.color field is kept as
it's already used by other driver.

Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Ensure proper register state printing for cond jumps

[ Upstream commit 1a8a315f008a58f54fecb012b928aa6a494435b3 ]

Verifier emits relevant register state involved in any given instruction
next to it after `;` to the right, if possible. Or, worst case, on the
separate line repeating instruction index.

E.g., a nice and simple case would be:

  2: (d5) if r0 s<= 0x0 goto pc+1       ; R0_w=0

But if there is some intervening extra output (e.g., precision
backtracking log) involved, we are supposed to see the state after the
precision backtrack log:

  4: (75) if r0 s>= 0x0 goto pc+1
  mark_precise: frame0: last_idx 4 first_idx 0 subseq_idx -1
  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r0 stack= before 2: (d5) if r0 s<= 0x0 goto pc+1
  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r0 stack= before 1: (b7) r0 = 0
  6: R0_w=0

First off, note that in `6: R0_w=0` instruction index corresponds to the
next instruction, not to the conditional jump instruction itself, which
is wrong and we'll get to that.

But besides that, the above is a happy case that does work today. Yet,
if it so happens that precision backtracking had to traverse some of the
parent states, this `6: R0_w=0` state output would be missing.

This is due to a quirk of print_verifier_state() routine, which performs
mark_verifier_state_clean(env) at the end. This marks all registers as
"non-scratched", which means that subsequent logic to print *relevant*
registers (that is, "scratched ones") fails and doesn't see anything
relevant to print and skips the output altogether.

print_verifier_state() is used both to print instruction context, but
also to print an **entire** verifier state indiscriminately, e.g.,
during precision backtracking (and in a few other situations, like
during entering or exiting subprogram).  Which means if we have to print
entire parent state before getting to printing instruction context
state, instruction context is marked as clean and is omitted.

Long story short, this is definitely not intentional. So we fix this
behavior in this patch by teaching print_verifier_state() to clear
scratch state only if it was used to print instruction state, not the
parent/callback state. This is determined by print_all option, so if
it's not set, we don't clear scratch state. This fixes missing
instruction state for these cases.

As for the mismatched instruction index, we fix that by making sure we
call print_insn_state() early inside check_cond_jmp_op() before we
adjusted insn_idx based on jump branch taken logic. And with that we get
desired correct information:

  9: (16) if w4 == 0x1 goto pc+9
  mark_precise: frame0: last_idx 9 first_idx 9 subseq_idx -1
  mark_precise: frame0: parent state regs=r4 stack=: R2_w=1944 R4_rw=P1 R10=fp0
  mark_precise: frame0: last_idx 8 first_idx 0 subseq_idx 9
  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r4 stack= before 8: (66) if w4 s> 0x3 goto pc+5
  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r4 stack= before 7: (b7) r4 = 1
  9: R4=1

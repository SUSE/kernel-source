Subject: [PATCH] fbdev: simplefb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather than
 .remove
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.9
Git-commit: 666b90b3ce9e4aac1e1deba266c3a230fb3913b0

[ Upstream commit 666b90b3ce9e4aac1e1deba266c3a230fb3913b0 ]

The driver is calling framebuffer_release() in its .remove callback, but
this will cause the struct fb_info to be freed too early. Since it could
be that a reference is still hold to it if user-space opened the fbdev.

This would lead to a use-after-free error if the framebuffer device was
unregistered but later a user-space process tries to close the fbdev fd.

To prevent this, move the framebuffer_release() call to fb_ops.fb_destroy
instead of doing it in the driver's .remove callback.

Strictly speaking, the code flow in the driver is still wrong because all
the hardware cleanupd (i.e: iounmap) should be done in .remove while the
software cleanup (i.e: releasing the framebuffer) should be done in the
.fb_destroy handler. But this at least makes to match the behavior before
commit 27599aacbaef ("fbdev: Hot-unplug firmware fb devices on forced removal").

[ Upstream commit a25351e4c7740eb22561a3ee4ef17611c6f410b0 ]

Implement workaround for ERR051198
(https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX8MN_0N14Y.pdf)

PWM output may not function correctly if the FIFO is empty when a new SAR
value is programmed.

Description:
  When the PWM FIFO is empty, a new value programmed to the PWM Sample
  register (PWM_PWMSAR) will be directly applied even if the current timer
  period has not expired. If the new SAMPLE value programmed in the
  PWM_PWMSAR register is less than the previous value, and the PWM counter
  register (PWM_PWMCNR) that contains the current COUNT value is greater
  than the new programmed SAMPLE value, the current period will not flip
  the level. This may result in an output pulse with a duty cycle of 100%.

Workaround:
  Program the current SAMPLE value in the PWM_PWMSAR register before
  updating the new duty cycle to the SAMPLE value in the PWM_PWMSAR
  register. This will ensure that the new SAMPLE value is modified during
  a non-empty FIFO, and can be successfully updated after the period
  expires.

Write the old SAR value before updating the new duty cycle to SAR. This
avoids writing the new value into an empty FIFO.

This only resolves the issue when the PWM period is longer than 2us
(or <500kHz) because write register is not quick enough when PWM period is
very short.

Reproduce steps:
  cd /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip1/pwm0
  echo 2000000000 > period     # It is easy to observe by using long period
  echo 1000000000 > duty_cycle
  echo 1 > enable
  echo       8000 > duty_cycle # One full high pulse will be seen by scope

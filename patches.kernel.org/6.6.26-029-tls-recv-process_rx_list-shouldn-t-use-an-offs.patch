Subject: [PATCH] tls: recv: process_rx_list shouldn't use an offset with kvec
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.26
Git-commit: 7608a971fdeb4c3eefa522d1bfe8d4bc6b2481cc

[ Upstream commit 7608a971fdeb4c3eefa522d1bfe8d4bc6b2481cc ]

Only MSG_PEEK needs to copy from an offset during the final
process_rx_list call, because the bytes we copied at the beginning of
tls_sw_recvmsg were left on the rx_list. In the KVEC case, we removed
data from the rx_list as we were copying it, so there's no need to use
an offset, just like in the normal case.

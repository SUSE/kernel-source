Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: renesas: r8a779h0: Drop "opp-shared" from
 opp-table-0
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: f3acb237a17962349b61eed813f62dddf7aead29

[ Upstream commit f3acb237a17962349b61eed813f62dddf7aead29 ]

The four Cortex-A76 CPU cores on R-Car V4M share their Operating
Performance Points (OPP) table, but they have independent clocks.
All cores in the cluster can switch DVFS states independently, hence
the cluster's OPP table should not have an "opp-shared" property.

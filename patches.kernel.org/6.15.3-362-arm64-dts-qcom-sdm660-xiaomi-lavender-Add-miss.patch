Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm660-xiaomi-lavender: Add missing SD card
 detect GPIO
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 2eca6af66709de0d1ba14cdf8b6d200a1337a3a2

[ Upstream commit 2eca6af66709de0d1ba14cdf8b6d200a1337a3a2 ]

During initial porting these cd-gpios were missed. Having card detect is
beneficial because driver does not need to do polling every second and it
can just use IRQ. SD card detection in U-Boot is also fixed by this.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix race between async reclaim worker and
 close_ctree()

[ Upstream commit a26bf338cdad3643a6e7c3d78a172baadba15c1a ]

Syzbot reported an assertion failure due to an attempt to add a delayed
iput after we have set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DELAYED_IPUT in the fs_info
state:

   </TASK>

This can happen due to a race with the async reclaim worker like this:

1) The async metadata reclaim worker enters shrink_delalloc(), which calls
   btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() with an nr_pages argument that has a value
   less than LONG_MAX, and that in turn enters start_delalloc_inodes(),
   which sets the local variable 'full_flush' to false because
   wbc->nr_to_write is less than LONG_MAX;

2) There it finds inode X in a root's delalloc list, grabs a reference for
   inode X (with igrab()), and triggers writeback for it with
   filemap_fdatawrite_wbc(), which creates an ordered extent for inode X;

3) The unmount sequence starts from another task, we enter close_ctree()
   and we flush the workqueue fs_info->endio_write_workers, which waits
   for the ordered extent for inode X to complete and when dropping the
   last reference of the ordered extent, with btrfs_put_ordered_extent(),
   when we call btrfs_add_delayed_iput() we don't add the inode to the
   list of delayed iputs because it has a refcount of 2, so we decrement
   it to 1 and return;

4) Shortly after at close_ctree() we call btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() which
   runs all delayed iputs, and then we set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DELAYED_IPUT
   in the fs_info state;

5) The async reclaim worker, after calling filemap_fdatawrite_wbc(), now
   calls btrfs_add_delayed_iput() for inode X and there we trigger an
   assertion failure since the fs_info state has the flag
   BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DELAYED_IPUT set.

Fix this by setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DELAYED_IPUT only after we wait for
the async reclaim workers to finish, after we call cancel_work_sync() for
them at close_ctree(), and by running delayed iputs after wait for the
reclaim workers to finish and before setting the bit.

This race was recently introduced by commit 19e60b2a95f5 ("btrfs: add
extra warning if delayed iput is added when it's not allowed"). Without
the new validation at btrfs_add_delayed_iput(), this described scenario
was safe because close_ctree() later calls btrfs_commit_super(). That
will run any final delayed iputs added by reclaim workers in the window
between the btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() and the the reclaim workers being
shut down.

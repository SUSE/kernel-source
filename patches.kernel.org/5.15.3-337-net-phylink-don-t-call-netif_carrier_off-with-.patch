Subject: [PATCH] net: phylink: don't call netif_carrier_off() with NULL netdev
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: cbcca2e3961eac736566ac13ef0d0bf6f0b764ec

[ Upstream commit cbcca2e3961eac736566ac13ef0d0bf6f0b764ec ]

Dan Carpenter points out that we have a code path that permits a NULL
netdev pointer to be passed to netif_carrier_off(), which will cause
a kernel oops. In any case, we need to set pl->old_link_state to false
to have the desired effect when there is no netdev present.

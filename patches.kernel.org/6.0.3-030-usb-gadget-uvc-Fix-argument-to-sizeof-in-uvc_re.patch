commit a15e17acce5aaae54243f55a7349c2225450b9bc upstream.

When building s390 allmodconfig after commit 9b91a6523078 ("usb: gadget:
uvc: increase worker prio to WQ_HIGHPRI"), the following error occurs:

  In file included from ../include/linux/string.h:253,
                   from ../include/linux/bitmap.h:11,
                   from ../include/linux/cpumask.h:12,

This points to the memset() in uvc_register_video(). It is clear that
the argument to sizeof() is incorrect, as uvc->vdev (a 'struct
video_device') is being zeroed out but the size of uvc->video (a 'struct
uvc_video') is being used as the third arugment to memset().

pahole shows that prior to commit 9b91a6523078 ("usb: gadget: uvc:
increase worker prio to WQ_HIGHPRI"), 'struct video_device' and
'struct ucv_video' had the same size, meaning that the argument to
sizeof() is incorrect semantically but there is no visible issue:

  $ pahole -s build/drivers/usb/gadget/function/f_uvc.o | grep -E "(uvc_video|video_device)\s+"
  video_device    1400    4
  uvc_video       1400    3

After that change, uvc_video becomes slightly larger, meaning that the
memset() will overwrite by 8 bytes:

  $ pahole -s build/drivers/usb/gadget/function/f_uvc.o | grep -E "(uvc_video|video_device)\s+"
  video_device    1400    4
  uvc_video       1408    3

Fix the arugment to sizeof() so that there is no overwrite.

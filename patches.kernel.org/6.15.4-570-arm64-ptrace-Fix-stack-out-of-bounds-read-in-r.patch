This issue seems to be related to the behavior of some gcc compilers and
was also fixed on the s390 architecture before:

 commit d93a855c31b7 ("s390/ptrace: Avoid KASAN false positives in regs_get_kernel_stack_nth()")

As described in that commit, regs_get_kernel_stack_nth() has confirmed that
`addr` is on the stack, so reading the value at `*addr` should be allowed.
Use READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() helper to silence the KASAN check for this case.

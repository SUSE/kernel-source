Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: take in count the bandwidth of a prepared stream
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: 08ae0d61c3d79bb5d52ae30ad4fc12442e966a23

[ Upstream commit 08ae0d61c3d79bb5d52ae30ad4fc12442e966a23 ]

When a stream's state is marked as prepared, it is ready for
playback/capture. Therefore, we need to include the stream's bandwidth
when we calculate the required bandwidth of a bus.

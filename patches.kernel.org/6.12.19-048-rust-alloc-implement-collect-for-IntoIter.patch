Subject: [PATCH] rust: alloc: implement `collect` for `IntoIter`
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: 93e602310f87b7b515b86a8f919cc0799387e5c3

commit 93e602310f87b7b515b86a8f919cc0799387e5c3 upstream.

Currently, we can't implement `FromIterator`. There are a couple of
issues with this trait in the kernel, namely:

  - Rust's specialization feature is unstable. This prevents us to
    optimize for the special case where `I::IntoIter` equals `Vec`'s
    `IntoIter` type.
  - We also can't use `I::IntoIter`'s type ID either to work around this,
    since `FromIterator` doesn't require this type to be `'static`.
  - `FromIterator::from_iter` does return `Self` instead of
    `Result<Self, AllocError>`, hence we can't properly handle allocation
    failures.
  - Neither `Iterator::collect` nor `FromIterator::from_iter` can handle
    additional allocation flags.

Instead, provide `IntoIter::collect`, such that we can at least convert
`IntoIter` into a `Vec` again.

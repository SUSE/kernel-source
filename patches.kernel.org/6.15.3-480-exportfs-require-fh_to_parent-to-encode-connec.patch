Subject: [PATCH] exportfs: require ->fh_to_parent() to encode connectable file
 handles
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 5402c4d4d2000a9baa30c1157c97152ec6383733

[ Upstream commit 5402c4d4d2000a9baa30c1157c97152ec6383733 ]

When user requests a connectable file handle explicitly with the
AT_HANDLE_CONNECTABLE flag, fail the request if filesystem (e.g. nfs)
does not know how to decode a connected non-dir dentry.

Fixes: c374196b2b9f ("fs: name_to_handle_at() support for "explicit connectable" file handles")

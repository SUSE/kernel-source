Subject: [PATCH] LoadPin: Fix Kconfig doc about format of file with verity
 digests
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: aafc203bbad4bf6cf394a34ea698c2b0b8affae0

commit aafc203bbad4bf6cf394a34ea698c2b0b8affae0 upstream.

The doc for CONFIG_SECURITY_LOADPIN_VERITY says that the file with verity
digests must contain a comma separated list of digests. That was the case
at some stage of the development, but was changed during the review
process to one digest per line. Update the Kconfig doc accordingly.

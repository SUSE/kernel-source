Subject: [PATCH] riscv: dts: starfive: Remove PMIC interrupt info for
 Visionfive 2 board
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.5
Git-commit: 0f74c64f0a9f6e1e7cf17bea3d4350fa6581e0d7

commit 0f74c64f0a9f6e1e7cf17bea3d4350fa6581e0d7 upstream.

Interrupt line number of the AXP15060 PMIC is not a necessary part of
its device tree. Originally the binding required one, so the dts patch
added an invalid interrupt that the driver ignored (0) as the interrupt
line of the PMIC is not actually connected on this platform. This went
unnoticed during review as it would have been a valid interrupt for a
GPIO controller, but it is not for the PLIC. The PLIC, on this platform
at least, silently ignores the enablement of interrupt 0. Bo Gan is
running a modified version of OpenSBI that faults if writes are done to
reserved fields, so their kernel runs into problems.

Delete the invalid interrupt from the device tree.

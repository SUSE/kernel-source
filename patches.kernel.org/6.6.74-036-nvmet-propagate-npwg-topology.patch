Subject: [PATCH] nvmet: propagate npwg topology
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.74
Git-commit: b579d6fdc3a9149bb4d2b3133cc0767130ed13e6

[ Upstream commit b579d6fdc3a9149bb4d2b3133cc0767130ed13e6 ]

Ensure we propagate npwg to the target as well instead
of assuming its the same logical blocks per physical block.

This ensures devices with large IUs information properly
propagated on the target.

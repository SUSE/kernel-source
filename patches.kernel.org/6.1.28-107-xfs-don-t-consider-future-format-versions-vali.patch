Subject: [PATCH] xfs: don't consider future format versions valid
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.28
Git-commit: aa88019851a85df80cb77f143758b13aee09e3d9

commit aa88019851a85df80cb77f143758b13aee09e3d9 upstream.

In commit fe08cc504448 we reworked the valid superblock version
checks. If it is a V5 filesystem, it is always valid, then we
checked if the version was less than V4 (reject) and then checked
feature fields in the V4 flags to determine if it was valid.

What we missed was that if the version is not V4 at this point,
we shoudl reject the fs. i.e. the check current treats V6+
filesystems as if it was a v4 filesystem. Fix this.

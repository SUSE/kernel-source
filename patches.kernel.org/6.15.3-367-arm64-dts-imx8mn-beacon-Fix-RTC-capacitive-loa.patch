Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx8mn-beacon: Fix RTC capacitive load
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: c3f03bec30efd5082b55876846d57b5d17dae7b9

[ Upstream commit c3f03bec30efd5082b55876846d57b5d17dae7b9 ]

Although not noticeable when used every day, the RTC appears to drift when
left to sit over time.  This is due to the capacitive load not being
properly set. Fix RTC drift by correcting the capacitive load setting
from 7000 to 12500, which matches the actual hardware configuration.

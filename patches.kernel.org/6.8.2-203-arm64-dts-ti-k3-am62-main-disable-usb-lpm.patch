Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62-main: disable usb lpm
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 9c99b337a8755a09df7735d4324ae26a6eca6261

[ Upstream commit 9c99b337a8755a09df7735d4324ae26a6eca6261 ]

AM62 USB works with some devices, while failing to operate with others.

[  560.189822] xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.4.auto: xHCI Host Controller
[  560.195631] xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.4.auto: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 2
[  574.388509] xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.4.auto: can't setup: -110
[  574.393814] xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.4.auto: USB bus 2 deregistered
[  574.399544] xhci-hcd: probe of xhci-hcd.4.auto failed with error -110

This seems to be related to LPM (Link Power Management), and disabling it
turns USB into reliable working state.

As per AM62 reference manual:

> 4.8.2.1 USB2SS Unsupported Features
>
> The following features are not supported on this family of devices:
> ...
> - USB 2.0 ECN: Link Power Management (LPM)
> ...

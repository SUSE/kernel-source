Subject: [PATCH] mlxsw: spectrum_cnt: Reorder counter pools
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.6
Git-commit: 4b7a632ac4e7101ceefee8484d5c2ca505d347b3

[ Upstream commit 4b7a632ac4e7101ceefee8484d5c2ca505d347b3 ]

Both RIF and ACL flow counters use a 24-bit SW-managed counter address to
communicate which counter they want to bind.

In a number of Spectrum FW releases, binding a RIF counter is broken and
slices the counter index to 16 bits. As a result, on Spectrum-2 and above,
no more than about 410 RIF counters can be effectively used. This
translates to 205 netdevices for which L3 HW stats can be enabled. (This
does not happen on Spectrum-1, because there are fewer counters available
overall and the counter index never exceeds 16 bits.)

Binding counters to ACLs does not have this issue. Therefore reorder the
counter allocation scheme so that RIF counters come first and therefore get
lower indices that are below the 16-bit barrier.

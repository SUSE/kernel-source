Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: Fix the msi-map entries
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.9
Git-commit: ecc3ac293ed15ac2536e9fde2810154486f84010

commit ecc3ac293ed15ac2536e9fde2810154486f84010 upstream.

While adding the GIC ITS MSI support, it was found that the msi-map entries
needed to be swapped to receive MSIs from the endpoint.

But later it was identified that the swapping was needed due to a bug in
the Qualcomm PCIe controller driver. And since the bug is now fixed with
commit bf79e33cdd89 ("PCI: qcom: Enable BDF to SID translation properly"),
let's fix the msi-map entries also to reflect the actual mapping in the
hardware.

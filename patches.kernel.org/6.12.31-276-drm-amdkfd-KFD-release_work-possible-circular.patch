Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdkfd: KFD release_work possible circular locking
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 1b9366c601039d60546794c63fbb83ce8e53b978

[ Upstream commit 1b9366c601039d60546794c63fbb83ce8e53b978 ]

If waiting for gpu reset done in KFD release_work, thers is WARNING:
possible circular locking dependency detected

  #2  kfd_create_process
        kfd_process_mutex
          flush kfd release work

  #1  kfd release work
        wait for amdgpu reset work

  #0  amdgpu_device_gpu_reset
        kgd2kfd_pre_reset
          kfd_process_mutex

  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----
   lock((work_completion)(&p->release_work));
                  lock((wq_completion)kfd_process_wq);
                  lock((work_completion)(&p->release_work));
   lock((wq_completion)amdgpu-reset-dev);

To fix this, KFD create process move flush release work outside
kfd_process_mutex.

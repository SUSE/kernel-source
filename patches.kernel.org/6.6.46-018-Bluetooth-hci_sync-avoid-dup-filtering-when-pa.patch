Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: hci_sync: avoid dup filtering when passive
 scanning with adv monitor
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.46
Git-commit: b5431dc2803ac159d6d4645ae237d15c3cb252db

[ Upstream commit b5431dc2803ac159d6d4645ae237d15c3cb252db ]

This restores behaviour (including the comment) from now-removed
hci_request.c, and also matches existing code for active scanning.

Without this, the duplicates filter is always active when passive
scanning, which makes it impossible to work with devices that send
nontrivial dynamic data in their advertisement reports.

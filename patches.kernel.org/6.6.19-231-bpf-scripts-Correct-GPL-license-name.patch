Subject: [PATCH] bpf, scripts: Correct GPL license name
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: e37243b65d528a8a9f8b9a57a43885f8e8dfc15c

[ Upstream commit e37243b65d528a8a9f8b9a57a43885f8e8dfc15c ]

The bpf_doc script refers to the GPL as the "GNU Privacy License".
I strongly suspect that the author wanted to refer to the GNU General
Public License, under which the Linux kernel is released, as, to the
best of my knowledge, there is no license named "GNU Privacy License".
This patch corrects the license name in the script accordingly.

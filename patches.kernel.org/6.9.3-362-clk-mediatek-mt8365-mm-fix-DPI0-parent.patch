Subject: [PATCH] clk: mediatek: mt8365-mm: fix DPI0 parent
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: 4c0c087772d7e29bc2489ddb068d5167140bfc38

[ Upstream commit 4c0c087772d7e29bc2489ddb068d5167140bfc38 ]

To have a working display through DPI, a workaround has been
implemented downstream to add "mm_dpi0_dpi0" and "dpi0_sel" to
the DPI node. Shortly, that add an extra clock.

It seems consistent to have the "dpi0_sel" as parent.
Additionnaly, "vpll_dpix" isn't used/managed.

Then, set the "mm_dpi0_dpi0" parent clock to "dpi0_sel".

The new clock tree is:

clk26m
  lvdspll
    lvdspll_X (2, 4, 8, 16)
      dpi0_sel
        mm_dpi0_dpi0

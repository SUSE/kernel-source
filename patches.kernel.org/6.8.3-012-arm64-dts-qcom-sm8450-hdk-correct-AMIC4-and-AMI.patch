Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450-hdk: correct AMIC4 and AMIC5
 microphones
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.3
Git-commit: 915253bdd64f2372fa5f6c58d75cb99972c7401d

[ Upstream commit 915253bdd64f2372fa5f6c58d75cb99972c7401d ]

Due to lack of documentation the AMIC4 and AMIC5 analogue microphones
were never actually working, so the audio routing for them was added
hoping it is correct.  It turned out not correct - their routing should
point to SWR_INPUT0 (so audio mixer TX SMIC MUX0 = SWR_MIC0) and
SWR_INPUT1 (so audio mixer TX SMIC MUX0 = SWR_MIC1), respectively.  With
proper mixer settings and fixed LPASS TX macr codec TX SMIC MUXn
widgets, this makes all microphones working on HDK8450.

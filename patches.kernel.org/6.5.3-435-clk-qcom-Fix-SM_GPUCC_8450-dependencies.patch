Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: Fix SM_GPUCC_8450 dependencies
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.3
Git-commit: 75d1d3a433f0a0748a89eb074830e9b635a19fd2

[ Upstream commit 75d1d3a433f0a0748a89eb074830e9b635a19fd2 ]

CONFIG_SM_GCC_8450 depends on ARM64 but it is selected by
CONFIG_SM_GPUCC_8450, which can be selected on ARM, resulting in a
Kconfig warning.

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SM_GCC_8450
  Depends on [n]: COMMON_CLK [=y] && COMMON_CLK_QCOM [=y] && (ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST [=n])
  Selected by [y]:
  - SM_GPUCC_8450 [=y] && COMMON_CLK [=y] && COMMON_CLK_QCOM [=y]

Add the same dependencies to CONFIG_SM_GPUCC_8450 to resolve the
warning.

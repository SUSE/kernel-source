Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: video: Add backlight=native DMI quirk for Dell G15 5515
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.11
Git-commit: f46acc1efd4b5846de9fa05f966e504f328f34a6

[ Upstream commit f46acc1efd4b5846de9fa05f966e504f328f34a6 ]

The Dell G15 5515 has the WMI interface (and WMI call returns) expected
by the nvidia-wmi-ec-backlight interface. But the backlight class device
registered by the nvidia-wmi-ec-backlight driver does not actually work.

The amdgpu_bl0 native GPU backlight class device does actually work,
add a backlight=native DMI quirk for this.

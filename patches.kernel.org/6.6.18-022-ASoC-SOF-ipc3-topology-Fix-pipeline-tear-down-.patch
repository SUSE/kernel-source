[ Upstream commit d7332c4a4f1a7d16f054c6357fb65c597b6a86a7 ]

With the change in the widget free logic to power down the cores only
when the scheduler widgets are freed, we need to ensure that the
scheduler widget is freed only after all the widgets associated with the
scheduler are freed. This is to ensure that the secondary core that the
scheduler is scheduled to run on is kept powered on until all widgets
that need them are in use. While this works well for dynamic pipelines,
in the case of static pipelines the current logic does not take this into
account and frees all widgets in the order they occur in the
widget_list. So, modify this to ensure that the scheduler widgets are freed
only after all other types of widgets in the widget_list are freed.

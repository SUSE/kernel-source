Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: qcom: correct the ngpios entry for QCS8300
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 32b5361a0d10627343b2ded76f05e5d591627fd6

[ Upstream commit 32b5361a0d10627343b2ded76f05e5d591627fd6 ]

Correct the ngpios entry to account for the UFS_RESET pin, which is
expected to be wired to the reset pin of the primary UFS memory and is
exported as GPIOs in addition to the real GPIOs, allowing the UFS driver
to toggle it.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: qcom: sc8280xp: use sa8775p/ subdir for QCS9100 /
 QCS9075
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.17.3
Git-commit: ba0c67d3c4b0ce5ec5e6de35e6433b22eecb1f6a

[ Upstream commit ba0c67d3c4b0ce5ec5e6de35e6433b22eecb1f6a ]

All firmware for the Lemans platform aka QCS9100 aka QCS9075 is for
historical reasons located in the qcom/sa8775p/ subdir inside
linux-firmware. The only exceptions to this rule are audio topology
files. While it's not too late, change the subdir to point to the
sa8775p/ subdir, so that all firmware for that platform is present at
the same location.

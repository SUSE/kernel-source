Subject: [PATCH] riscv: Prevent a bad reference count on CPU nodes

[ Upstream commit 37233169a6ea912020c572f870075a63293b786a ]

When populating cache leaves we previously fetched the CPU device node
at the very beginning. But when ACPI is enabled we go through a
specific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' for
the node that was acquired.

Since we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we
can simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, and
we are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node.
This prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.

Moreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring
the device node, so a return -ENOENT has been added for that case.

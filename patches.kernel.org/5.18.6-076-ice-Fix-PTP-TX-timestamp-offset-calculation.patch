Subject: [PATCH] ice: Fix PTP TX timestamp offset calculation
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.6
Git-commit: 71a579f0d3777a704355e6f1572dfba92a9b58b2

[ Upstream commit 71a579f0d3777a704355e6f1572dfba92a9b58b2 ]

The offset was being incorrectly calculated for E822 - that led to
collisions in choosing TX timestamp register location when more than
one port was trying to use timestamping mechanism.

In E822 one quad is being logically split between ports, so quad 0 is
having trackers for ports 0-3, quad 1 ports 4-7 etc. Each port should
have separate memory location for tracking timestamps. Due to error for
example ports 1 and 2 had been assigned to quad 0 with same offset (0),
while port 1 should have offset 0 and 1 offset 16.

Fix it by correctly calculating quad offset.

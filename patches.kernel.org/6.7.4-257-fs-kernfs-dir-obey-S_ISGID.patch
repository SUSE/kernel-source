Subject: [PATCH] fs/kernfs/dir: obey S_ISGID
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.4
Git-commit: 5133bee62f0ea5d4c316d503cc0040cac5637601

[ Upstream commit 5133bee62f0ea5d4c316d503cc0040cac5637601 ]

Handling of S_ISGID is usually done by inode_init_owner() in all other
filesystems, but kernfs doesn't use that function.  In kernfs, struct
kernfs_node is the primary data structure, and struct inode is only
created from it on demand.  Therefore, inode_init_owner() can't be
used and we need to imitate its behavior.

S_ISGID support is useful for the cgroup filesystem; it allows
subtrees managed by an unprivileged process to retain a certain owner
gid, which then enables sharing access to the subtree with another
unprivileged process.

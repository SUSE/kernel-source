Subject: [PATCH] wifi: cfg80211: correct comment about MLD ID
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 2a0698f86d4dfc43cc0c1703efb7ba6b1506a4e2

[ Upstream commit 2a0698f86d4dfc43cc0c1703efb7ba6b1506a4e2 ]

The comment was referencing the wrong section of the documentation and
was also subtly wrong as it assumed the rules that apply when sending
probe requests directly to a nontransmitted AP. However, in that case
the response comes from the transmitting AP and the AP MLD ID will be
included.

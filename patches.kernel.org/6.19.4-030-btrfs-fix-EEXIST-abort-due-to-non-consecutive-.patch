Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: fix EEXIST abort due to non-consecutive gaps in chunk
 allocation
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit b14c5e04bd0f722ed631845599d52d03fcae1bc1 ]

I have been observing a number of systems aborting at
insert_dev_extents() in btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(). The
following is a sample stack trace of such an abort coming from forced
chunk allocation (typically behind CONFIG_BTRFS_EXPERIMENTAL) but this
can theoretically happen to any DUP chunk allocation.

Inspecting these aborts with drgn, I observed a pattern of overlapping
chunk_maps. Note how stripe 1 of the first chunk overlaps in physical
address with stripe 0 of the second chunk.

Now how could this possibly happen? All chunk allocation is protected by
the chunk_mutex so racing allocations should see a consistent view of
the CHUNK_ALLOCATED bit in the chunk allocation extent-io-tree
(device->alloc_state as set by chunk_map_device_set_bits()) The tree
itself is protected by a spin lock, and clearing/setting the bits is
always protected by fs_info->mapping_tree_lock, so no race is apparent.

It turns out that there is a subtle bug in the logic regarding chunk
allocations that have happened in the current transaction, known as
"pending extents". The chunk allocation as defined in
find_free_dev_extent() is a loop which searches the commit root of the
dev_root and looks for gaps between DEV_EXTENT items. For those gaps, it
then checks alloc_state bitmap for any pending extents and adjusts the
hole that it finds accordingly. However, the logic in that adjustment
assumes that the first pending extent is the only one in that range.

e.g., given a layout with two non-consecutive pending extents in a hole
passed to dev_extent_hole_check() via *hole_start and *hole_size:

  |----pending A----|    real hole     |----pending B----|
           |           candidate hole        |
      *hole_start                         *hole_start + *hole_size

the code incorrectly returns a "hole" from the end of pending extent A
until the passed in hole end, failing to account for pending B.

However, it is not entirely obvious that it is actually possible to
produce such a layout. I was able to reproduce it, but with some
contortions: I continued to use the force chunk allocation sysfs file
and I introduced a long delay (10 seconds) into the start of the cleaner
thread. I also prevented the unused bgs cleaning logic from ever
deleting metadata bgs. These help make it easier to deterministically
produce the condition but shouldn't really matter if you imagine the
conditions happening by race/luck. Allocations/frees can happen
concurrently with the cleaner thread preparing to process an unused
extent and both create some used chunks with an unused chunk
interleaved, all during one transaction. Then btrfs_delete_unused_bgs()
sees the unused one and clears it, leaving a range with several pending
chunk allocations and a gap in the middle.

The basic idea is that the unused_bgs cleanup work happens on a worker
so if we allocate 3 block groups in one transaction, then the cleaner
work kicked off by the previous transaction comes through and deletes
the middle one of the 3, then the commit root shows no dev extents and
we have the bad pattern in the extent-io-tree. One final consideration
is that the code happens to loop to the next hole if there are no more
extents at all, so we need one more dev extent way past the area we are
working in. Something like the following demonstrates the technique:

  # push the BG frontier out to 20G
  fallocate -l 20G $mnt/foo
  # allocate one more that will prevent the "no more dev extents" luck
  fallocate -l 1G $mnt/sticky
  # sync
  sync
  # clear out the allocation area
  rm $mnt/foo
  sync
  _cleaner
  # let everything quiesce
  sleep 20
  sync

  # dev tree should have one bg 20G out and the rest at the beginning..
  # sort of like an empty FS but with a random sticky chunk.

  # kick off the cleaner in the background, remember it will sleep 10s
  # before doing interesting work
  _cleaner &

  sleep 3

  # create 3 trivial block groups, all empty, all immediately marked as unused.
  echo 1 > "$(_btrfs_sysfs_space_info $dev metadata)/force_chunk_alloc"
  echo 1 > "$(_btrfs_sysfs_space_info $dev data)/force_chunk_alloc"
  echo 1 > "$(_btrfs_sysfs_space_info $dev metadata)/force_chunk_alloc"

  # let the cleaner thread definitely finish, it will remove the data bg
  sleep 10

  # this allocation sees the non-consecutive pending metadata chunks with
  # data chunk gap of 1G and allocates a 2G extent in that hole. ENOSPC!
  echo 1 > "$(_btrfs_sysfs_space_info $dev metadata)/force_chunk_alloc"

As for the fix, it is not that obvious. I could not see a trivial way to
do it even by adding backup loops into find_free_dev_extent(), so I
opted to change the semantics of dev_extent_hole_check() to not stop
looping until it finds a sufficiently big hole. For clarity, this also
required changing the helper function contains_pending_extent() into two
new helpers which find the first pending extent and the first suitable
hole in a range.

I attempted to clean up the documentation and range calculations to be
as consistent and clear as possible for the future.

I also looked at the zoned case and concluded that the loop there is
different and not to be unified with this one. As far as I can tell, the
zoned check will only further constrain the hole so looping back to find
more holes is acceptable. Though given that zoned really only appends, I
find it highly unlikely that it is susceptible to this bug.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: Fix SPMI channels size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: a4f82b8045e3c7913266aa6ea1ee15752a062abd

[ Upstream commit a4f82b8045e3c7913266aa6ea1ee15752a062abd ]

The actual size of the channels registers region is 4MB, according to the
documentation. This issue was not caught until now because the driver was
supposed to allow same regions being mapped multiple times for supporting
multiple buses. Thie driver is using platform_get_resource_byname() and
devm_ioremap() towards that purpose, which intentionally avoids
devm_request_mem_region() altogether.

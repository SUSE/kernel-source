Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: gcc-x1e80100: Fix USB MP SS1 PHY GDSC pwrsts flags
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: e7f37a7d16310d3c9474825de26a67f00983ebea

commit e7f37a7d16310d3c9474825de26a67f00983ebea upstream.

Allowing these GDSCs to collapse makes the QMP combo PHYs lose their
configuration on machine suspend. Currently, the QMP combo PHY driver
doesn't reinitialise the HW on resume. Under such conditions, the USB
SuperSpeed support is broken. To avoid this, mark the pwrsts flags with
RET_ON. This has been already done for USB 0 and 1 SS PHY GDSCs,
Do this also for the USB MP SS1 PHY GDSC config. The USB MP SS0 PHY GDSC
already has it.

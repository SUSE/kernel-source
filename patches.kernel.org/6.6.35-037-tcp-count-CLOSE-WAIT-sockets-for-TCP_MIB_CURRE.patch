Subject: [PATCH] tcp: count CLOSE-WAIT sockets for TCP_MIB_CURRESTAB
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.35
Git-commit: a46d0ea5c94205f40ecf912d1bb7806a8a64704f

[ Upstream commit a46d0ea5c94205f40ecf912d1bb7806a8a64704f ]

According to RFC 1213, we should also take CLOSE-WAIT sockets into
consideration:

  "tcpCurrEstab OBJECT-TYPE
   ...
   The number of TCP connections for which the current state
   is either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE- WAIT."

After this, CurrEstab counter will display the total number of
ESTABLISHED and CLOSE-WAIT sockets.

The logic of counting
When we increment the counter?
a) if we change the state to ESTABLISHED.
b) if we change the state from SYN-RECEIVED to CLOSE-WAIT.

When we decrement the counter?
a) if the socket leaves ESTABLISHED and will never go into CLOSE-WAIT,
say, on the client side, changing from ESTABLISHED to FIN-WAIT-1.
b) if the socket leaves CLOSE-WAIT, say, on the server side, changing
from CLOSE-WAIT to LAST-ACK.

Please note: there are two chances that old state of socket can be changed
to CLOSE-WAIT in tcp_fin(). One is SYN-RECV, the other is ESTABLISHED.
So we have to take care of the former case.

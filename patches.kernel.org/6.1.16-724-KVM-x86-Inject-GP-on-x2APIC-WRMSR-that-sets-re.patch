Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: Inject #GP on x2APIC WRMSR that sets reserved bits
 63:32
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: ab52be1b310bcb39e6745d34a8f0e8475d67381a

commit ab52be1b310bcb39e6745d34a8f0e8475d67381a upstream.

Reject attempts to set bits 63:32 for 32-bit x2APIC registers, i.e. all
x2APIC registers except ICR.  Per Intel's SDM:

  Non-zero writes (by WRMSR instruction) to reserved bits to these
  registers will raise a general protection fault exception

Opportunistically fix a typo in a nearby comment.

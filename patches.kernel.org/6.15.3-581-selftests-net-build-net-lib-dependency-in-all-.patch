Subject: [PATCH] selftests: net: build net/lib dependency in all target
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: d3f2a9587ebe68f5067f9ff624f9a83dfb911f60

[ Upstream commit d3f2a9587ebe68f5067f9ff624f9a83dfb911f60 ]

We have the logic to include net/lib automatically for net related
selftests. However, currently, this logic is only in install target
which means only `make install` will have net/lib included. This commit
adds the logic to all target so that all `make`, `make run_tests` and
`make install` will have net/lib included in net related selftests.

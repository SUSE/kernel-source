Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: freescale: imx8mp-verdin-dahlia: add Microphone
 Jack to sound card
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.21
Git-commit: b0612fdba9afdce261bfb8684e0cece6f2e2b0bb

commit b0612fdba9afdce261bfb8684e0cece6f2e2b0bb upstream.

The simple-audio-card's microphone widget currently connects to the
headphone jack. Routing the microphone input to the microphone jack
allows for independent operation of the microphone and headphones.

This resolves the following boot-time kernel log message, which
indicated a conflict when the microphone and headphone functions were
not separated:
  debugfs: File 'Headphone Jack' in directory 'dapm' already present!

Subject: [PATCH] f2fs: Fix f2fs_truncate_partial_nodes ftrace event
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.26
Git-commit: 0b04d4c0542e8573a837b1d81b94209e48723b25

[ Upstream commit 0b04d4c0542e8573a837b1d81b94209e48723b25 ]

Fix the nid_t field so that its size is correctly reported in the text
format embedded in trace.dat files. As it stands, it is reported as
being of size 4:

        field:nid_t nid[3];     offset:24;      size:4; signed:0;

Instead of 12:

        field:nid_t nid[3];     offset:24;      size:12;        signed:0;

This also fixes the reported offset of subsequent fields so that they
match with the actual struct layout.

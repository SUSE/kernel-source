Subject: [PATCH] selftests: forwarding: Fix layer 2 miss test flakiness
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.6
Git-commit: 93590849a05edffaefa11695fab98f621259ded2

[ Upstream commit 93590849a05edffaefa11695fab98f621259ded2 ]

After enabling a multicast querier on the bridge (like the test is
doing), the bridge will wait for the Max Response Delay before starting
to forward according to its MDB in order to let Membership Reports
enough time to be received and processed.

Currently, the test is waiting for exactly the default Max Response
Delay (10 seconds) which is racy and leads to failures [1].

Fix by reducing the Max Response Delay to 1 second.

 # TEST: L2 miss - Multicast (IPv4)                                    [FAIL]
 # Unregistered multicast filter was hit after adding MDB entry

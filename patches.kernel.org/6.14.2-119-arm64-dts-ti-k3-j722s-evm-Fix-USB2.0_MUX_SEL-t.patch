Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-j722s-evm: Fix USB2.0_MUX_SEL to select
 Type-C
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: bc8d9e6b5821c40ab5dd3a81e096cb114939de50

[ Upstream commit bc8d9e6b5821c40ab5dd3a81e096cb114939de50 ]

J722S SOC has two usb controllers USB0 and USB1. USB0 is brought out on
the EVM as a stacked USB connector which has one Type-A and one Type-C
port. These Type-A and Type-C ports are connected to MUX so only
one of them can be enabled at a time.

Commit under Fixes, tries to enable the USB0 instance of USB to
interface with the Type-C port via the USB hub, by configuring the
USB2.0_MUX_SEL to GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH. But it is observed on J722S-EVM
that Type-A port is enabled instead of Type-C port.

Fix this by setting USB2.0_MUX_SEL to GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW to enable Type-C
port.

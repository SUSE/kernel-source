Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: net: mediatek: remove wrongly added clocks and
 SerDes
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.31
Git-commit: cc349b0771dccebf0fa9f5e1822ac444aef11448

[ Upstream commit cc349b0771dccebf0fa9f5e1822ac444aef11448 ]

Several clocks as well as both sgmiisys phandles were added by mistake
to the Ethernet bindings for MT7988. Also, the total number of clocks
didn't match with the actual number of items listed.

This happened because the vendor driver which served as a reference uses
a high number of syscon phandles to access various parts of the SoC
which wasn't acceptable upstream. Hence several parts which have never
previously been supported (such SerDes PHY and USXGMII PCS) are going to
be implemented by separate drivers. As a result the device tree will
look much more sane.

Quickly align the bindings with the upcoming reality of the drivers
actually adding support for the remaining Ethernet-related features of
the MT7988 SoC.

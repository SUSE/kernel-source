Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: phy_device: Fix PHY LED blinking code comment
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.9
Git-commit: d3dcb084c70727be4a2f61bd94796e66147cfa35

[ Upstream commit d3dcb084c70727be4a2f61bd94796e66147cfa35 ]

Fix copy-paste error in the code comment. The code refers to
LED blinking configuration, not brightness configuration. It
was likely copied from comment above this one which does
refer to brightness configuration.

Fixes: 4e901018432e ("net: phy: phy_device: Call into the PHY driver to set LED blinking")

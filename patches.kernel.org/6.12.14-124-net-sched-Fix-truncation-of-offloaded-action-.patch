Subject: [PATCH] net: sched: Fix truncation of offloaded action statistics
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.14
Git-commit: 811b8f534fd85e17077bd2ac0413bcd16cc8fb9b

[ Upstream commit 811b8f534fd85e17077bd2ac0413bcd16cc8fb9b ]

In case of tc offload, when user space queries the kernel for tc action
statistics, tc will query the offloaded statistics from device drivers.
Among other statistics, drivers are expected to pass the number of
packets that hit the action since the last query as a 64-bit number.

Unfortunately, tc treats the number of packets as a 32-bit number,
leading to truncation and incorrect statistics when the number of
packets since the last query exceeds 0xffffffff:

$ tc -s filter show dev swp2 ingress
filter protocol all pref 1 flower chain 0
filter protocol all pref 1 flower chain 0 handle 0x1
  skip_sw
  in_hw in_hw_count 1
        action order 1: mirred (Egress Redirect to device swp1) stolen
        index 1 ref 1 bind 1 installed 58 sec used 0 sec
        Action statistics:
        Sent 1133877034176 bytes 536959475 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
[...]

According to the above, 2111-byte packets were redirected which is
impossible as only 64-byte packets were transmitted and the MTU was
1500.

Fix by treating packets as a 64-bit number:

$ tc -s filter show dev swp2 ingress
filter protocol all pref 1 flower chain 0
filter protocol all pref 1 flower chain 0 handle 0x1
  skip_sw
  in_hw in_hw_count 1
        action order 1: mirred (Egress Redirect to device swp1) stolen
        index 1 ref 1 bind 1 installed 61 sec used 0 sec
        Action statistics:
        Sent 1370624380864 bytes 21416005951 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
[...]

Which shows that only 64-byte packets were redirected (1370624380864 /
21416005951 = 64).

Subject: [PATCH] gpio: Restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before
 initialization
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.3
Git-commit: 5467801f1fcbdc46bc7298a84dbf3ca1ff2a7320

commit 5467801f1fcbdc46bc7298a84dbf3ca1ff2a7320 upstream.

GPIO chip irq members are exposed before they could be completely
initialized and this leads to race conditions.

One such issue was observed for the gc->irq.domain variable which
was accessed through the I2C interface in gpiochip_to_irq() before
it could be initialized by gpiochip_add_irqchip(). This resulted in
Kernel NULL pointer dereference.

Following are the logs for reference :-

kernel: Call Trace:
kernel:  gpiod_to_irq+0x53/0x70
kernel:  acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by+0x113/0x1f0
kernel:  i2c_acpi_get_irq+0xc0/0xd0
kernel:  i2c_device_probe+0x28a/0x2a0
kernel:  really_probe+0xf2/0x460
kernel: RIP: 0010:gpiochip_to_irq+0x47/0xc0

To avoid such scenarios, restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before
they are completely initialized.

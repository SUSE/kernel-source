Subject: [PATCH] tcp: fix tcp_packet_delayed() for
 tcp_is_non_sack_preventing_reopen() behavior
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: d0fa59897e049e84432600e86df82aab3dce7aa5

[ Upstream commit d0fa59897e049e84432600e86df82aab3dce7aa5 ]

After the following commit from 2024:

commit e37ab7373696 ("tcp: fix to allow timestamp undo if no retransmits were sent")

...there was buggy behavior where TCP connections without SACK support
could easily see erroneous undo events at the end of fast recovery or
RTO recovery episodes. The erroneous undo events could cause those
connections to suffer repeated loss recovery episodes and high
retransmit rates.

The problem was an interaction between the non-SACK behavior on these
connections and the undo logic. The problem is that, for non-SACK
connections at the end of a loss recovery episode, if snd_una ==
high_seq, then tcp_is_non_sack_preventing_reopen() holds steady in
CA_Recovery or CA_Loss, but clears tp->retrans_stamp to 0. Then upon
the next ACK the "tcp: fix to allow timestamp undo if no retransmits
were sent" logic saw the tp->retrans_stamp at 0 and erroneously
concluded that no data was retransmitted, and erroneously performed an
undo of the cwnd reduction, restoring cwnd immediately to the value it
had before loss recovery.  This caused an immediate burst of traffic
and build-up of queues and likely another immediate loss recovery
episode.

This commit fixes tcp_packet_delayed() to ignore zero retrans_stamp
values for non-SACK connections when snd_una is at or above high_seq,
because tcp_is_non_sack_preventing_reopen() clears retrans_stamp in
this case, so it's not a valid signal that we can undo.

Note that the commit named in the Fixes footer restored long-present
behavior from roughly 2005-2019, so apparently this bug was present
for a while during that era, and this was simply not caught.

Subject: [PATCH] i2c: core: fix reference leak in i2c_register_adapter()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.11
Git-commit: 3f8c4f5e9a57868fa107016c81165686d23325f2

[ Upstream commit 3f8c4f5e9a57868fa107016c81165686d23325f2 ]

The reference count of the device incremented in device_initialize() is
not decremented when device_add() fails. Add a put_device() call before
returning from the function.

This bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool that I am
developing.

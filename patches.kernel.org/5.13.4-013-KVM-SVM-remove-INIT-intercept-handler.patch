Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: remove INIT intercept handler
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: 896707c212d440a6863ce0a3930c8a609e24497d

commit 896707c212d440a6863ce0a3930c8a609e24497d upstream.

Kernel never sends real INIT even to CPUs, other than on boot.

Thus INIT interception is an error which should be caught
by a check for an unknown VMexit reason.

On top of that, the current INIT VM exit handler skips
the current instruction which is wrong.
That was added in commit 5ff3a351f687 ("KVM: x86: Move trivial
instruction-based exit handlers to common code").

Fixes: 5ff3a351f687 ("KVM: x86: Move trivial instruction-based exit handlers to common code")

Subject: [PATCH] usb: ulpi: defer ulpi_register on ulpi_read_id timeout
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.7
Git-commit: 8a7b31d545d3a15f0e6f5984ae16f0ca4fd76aac

[ Upstream commit 8a7b31d545d3a15f0e6f5984ae16f0ca4fd76aac ]

Since commit 0f0101719138 ("usb: dwc3: Don't switch OTG -> peripheral
if extcon is present") Dual Role support on Intel Merrifield platform
broke due to rearranging the call to dwc3_get_extcon().

It appears to be caused by ulpi_read_id() on the first test write failing
with -ETIMEDOUT. Currently ulpi_read_id() expects to discover the phy via
DT when the test write fails and returns 0 in that case, even if DT does not
provide the phy. As a result usb probe completes without phy.

Make ulpi_read_id() return -ETIMEDOUT to its user if the first test write
fails. The user should then handle it appropriately. A follow up patch
will make dwc3_core_init() set -EPROBE_DEFER in this case and bail out.

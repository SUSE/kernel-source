Subject: [PATCH] x86/i8253: Call clockevent_i8253_disable() with interrupts
 disabled
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.26
Git-commit: 3940f5349b476197fb079c5aa19c9a988de64efb

[ Upstream commit 3940f5349b476197fb079c5aa19c9a988de64efb ]

There's a lockdep false positive warning related to i8253_lock:

  WARNING: HARDIRQ-safe -> HARDIRQ-unsafe lock order detected
  ...
  systemd-sleep/3324 [HC0[0]:SC0[0]:HE0:SE1] is trying to acquire:
  ffffffffb2c23398 (i8253_lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at: pcspkr_event+0x3f/0xe0 [pcspkr]

  ...
  ... which became HARDIRQ-irq-unsafe at:
  ...

    common_startup_64+0x13e/0x141
  ...

Lockdep complains due pit_timer_init() using the lock in an IRQ-unsafe
fashion, but it's a false positive, because there is no deadlock
possible at that point due to init ordering: at the point where
pit_timer_init() is called there is no other possible usage of
i8253_lock because the system is still in the very early boot stage
with no interrupts.

But in any case, pit_timer_init() should disable interrupts before
calling clockevent_i8253_disable() out of general principle, and to
keep lockdep working even in this scenario.

Use scoped_guard() for that, as suggested by Thomas Gleixner.

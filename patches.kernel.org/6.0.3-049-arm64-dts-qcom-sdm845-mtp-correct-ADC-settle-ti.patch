Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-mtp: correct ADC settle time
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: 209a04885ab5f76722a1671d0fbf0a5b4bccacec

commit 209a04885ab5f76722a1671d0fbf0a5b4bccacec upstream.

The PMIC's VADC property for settle time is qcom,hw-settle-time, not
qcom,hw-settle-time-us.  The latter is used in PMIC's TM ADC.

  qcom/sdm845-mtp.dtb: pmic@0: adc@3100:adc-chan@4c: 'qcom,hw-settle-time-us' does not match any of the regexes: 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'

Fixes: d5e12f3823ae ("arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: mtp: Add vadc channels and thermal zones")

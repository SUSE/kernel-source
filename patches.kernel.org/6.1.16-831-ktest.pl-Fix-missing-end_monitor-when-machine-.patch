Subject: [PATCH] ktest.pl: Fix missing "end_monitor" when machine check fails
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: e8bf9b98d40dbdf4e39362e3b85a70c61da68cb7

commit e8bf9b98d40dbdf4e39362e3b85a70c61da68cb7 upstream.

In the "reboot" command, it does a check of the machine to see if it is
still alive with a simple "ssh echo" command. If it fails, it will assume
that a normal "ssh reboot" is not possible and force a power cycle.

In this case, the "start_monitor" is executed, but the "end_monitor" is
not, and this causes the screen will not be given back to the console. That
is, after the test, a "reset" command needs to be performed, as "echo" is
turned off.

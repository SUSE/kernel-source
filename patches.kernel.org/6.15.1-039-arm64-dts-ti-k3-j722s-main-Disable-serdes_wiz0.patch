Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-j722s-main: Disable "serdes_wiz0" and
 "serdes_wiz1"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.1
Git-commit: 320d8a84f6f045dc876d4c2983f9024c7ac9d6df

commit 320d8a84f6f045dc876d4c2983f9024c7ac9d6df upstream.

Since "serdes0" and "serdes1" which are the sub-nodes of "serdes_wiz0"
and "serdes_wiz1" respectively, have been disabled in the SoC file already,
and, given that these sub-nodes will only be enabled in a board file if the
board utilizes any of the SERDES instances and the peripherals bound to
them, we end up in a situation where the board file doesn't explicitly
disable "serdes_wiz0" and "serdes_wiz1". As a consequence of this, the
following errors show up when booting Linux:

  wiz bus@f0000:phy@f000000: probe with driver wiz failed with error -12
  ...
  wiz bus@f0000:phy@f010000: probe with driver wiz failed with error -12

To not only fix the above, but also, in order to follow the convention of
disabling device-tree nodes in the SoC file and enabling them in the board
files for those boards which require them, disable "serdes_wiz0" and
"serdes_wiz1" device-tree nodes.

Subject: [PATCH] misc: fastrpc: Reassign memory ownership only for remote heap
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.7
Git-commit: 3c7d0079a1831118ef232bd9c2f34d058a1f31c2

commit 3c7d0079a1831118ef232bd9c2f34d058a1f31c2 upstream.

The userspace map request for remote heap allocates CMA memory.
The ownership of this memory needs to be reassigned to proper
owners to allow access from the protection domain running on
DSP. This reassigning of ownership is not correct if done for
any other supported flags.

When any other flag is requested from userspace, fastrpc is
trying to reassign the ownership of memory and this reassignment
is getting skipped for remote heap request which is incorrect.
Add proper flag check to reassign the memory only if remote heap
is requested.

Fixes: 532ad70c6d44 ("misc: fastrpc: Add mmap request assigning for static PD pool")

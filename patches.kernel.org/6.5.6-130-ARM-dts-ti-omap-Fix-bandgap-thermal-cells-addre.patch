Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: ti: omap: Fix bandgap thermal cells addressing for
 omap3/4
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: 6469b2feade8fd82d224dd3734e146536f3e9f0e

[ Upstream commit 6469b2feade8fd82d224dd3734e146536f3e9f0e ]

Fix "thermal_sys: cpu_thermal: Failed to read thermal-sensors cells: -2"
error on boot for omap3/4. This is caused by wrong addressing in the dts
for bandgap sensor for single sensor instances.

Note that omap4-cpu-thermal.dtsi is shared across omap4/5 and dra7, so
we can't just change the addressing in omap4-cpu-thermal.dtsi.

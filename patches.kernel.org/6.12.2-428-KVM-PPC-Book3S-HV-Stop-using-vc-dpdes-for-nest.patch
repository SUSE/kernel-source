Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Stop using vc->dpdes for nested KVM
 guests
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: 0d3c6b28896f9889c8864dab469e0343a0ad1c0c

[ Upstream commit 0d3c6b28896f9889c8864dab469e0343a0ad1c0c ]

commit 6398326b9ba1 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Stop using vc->dpdes")
introduced an optimization to use only vcpu->doorbell_request for SMT
emulation for Power9 and above guests, but the code for nested guests
still relies on the old way of handling doorbells, due to which an L2
guest (see [1]) cannot be booted with XICS with SMT>1. The command to
repro this issue is:

// To be run in L1

qemu-system-ppc64 \
	-drive file=rhel.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
	-m 20G \
	-smp 8,cores=1,threads=8 \
	-cpu  host \
	-nographic \
	-machine pseries,ic-mode=xics -accel kvm

Fix the plumbing to utilize vcpu->doorbell_request instead of vcore->dpdes
for nested KVM guests on P9 and above.

[1] Terminology
1. L0 : PowerNV linux running with HV privileges
2. L1 : Pseries KVM guest running on top of L0
2. L2 : Nested KVM guest running on top of L1

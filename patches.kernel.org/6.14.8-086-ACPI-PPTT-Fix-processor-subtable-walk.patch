Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: PPTT: Fix processor subtable walk
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.8
Git-commit: adfab6b39202481bb43286fff94def4953793fdb

commit adfab6b39202481bb43286fff94def4953793fdb upstream.

The original PPTT code had a bug where the processor subtable length
was not correctly validated when encountering a truncated
acpi_pptt_processor node.

Commit 7ab4f0e37a0f4 ("ACPI PPTT: Fix coding mistakes in a couple of
sizeof() calls") attempted to fix this by validating the size is as
large as the acpi_pptt_processor node structure. This introduced a
regression where the last processor node in the PPTT table is ignored
if it doesn't contain any private resources. That results errors like:

  ACPI PPTT: PPTT table found, but unable to locate core XX (XX)
  ACPI: SPE must be homogeneous

Furthermore, it fails in a common case where the node length isn't
equal to the acpi_pptt_processor structure size, leaving the original
bug in a modified form.

Correct the regression by adjusting the loop termination conditions as
suggested by the bug reporters. An additional check performed after
the subtable node type is detected, validates the acpi_pptt_processor
node is fully contained in the PPTT table. Repeating the check in
acpi_pptt_leaf_node() is largely redundant as the node is already
known to be fully contained in the table.

The case where a final truncated node's parent property is accepted,
but the node itself is rejected should not be considered a bug.

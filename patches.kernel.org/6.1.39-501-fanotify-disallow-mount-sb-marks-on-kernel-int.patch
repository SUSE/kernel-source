Subject: [PATCH] fanotify: disallow mount/sb marks on kernel internal pseudo
 fs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.39
Git-commit: 69562eb0bd3e6bb8e522a7b254334e0fb30dff0c

[ Upstream commit 69562eb0bd3e6bb8e522a7b254334e0fb30dff0c ]

Hopefully, nobody is trying to abuse mount/sb marks for watching all
anonymous pipes/inodes.

I cannot think of a good reason to allow this - it looks like an
oversight that dated back to the original fanotify API.

Subject: [PATCH] ata: ahci: Disallow LPM for Asus B550-F motherboard
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: a7b3b77fd111d49f8e25624e4ea1046322a57baf

commit a7b3b77fd111d49f8e25624e4ea1046322a57baf upstream.

Asus ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI) motherboard has problems on some
SATA ports with at least one hard drive model (WDC WD20EFAX-68FB5N0)
when LPM is enabled. Disabling LPM solves the issue.

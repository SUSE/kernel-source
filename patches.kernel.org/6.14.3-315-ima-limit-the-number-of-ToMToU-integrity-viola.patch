Subject: [PATCH] ima: limit the number of ToMToU integrity violations
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.3
Git-commit: a414016218ca97140171aa3bb926b02e1f68c2cc

commit a414016218ca97140171aa3bb926b02e1f68c2cc upstream.

Each time a file in policy, that is already opened for read, is opened
for write, a Time-of-Measure-Time-of-Use (ToMToU) integrity violation
audit message is emitted and a violation record is added to the IMA
measurement list.  This occurs even if a ToMToU violation has already
been recorded.

Limit the number of ToMToU integrity violations per file open for read.

Note: The IMA_MAY_EMIT_TOMTOU atomic flag must be set from the reader
side based on policy.  This may result in a per file open for read
ToMToU violation.

Since IMA_MUST_MEASURE is only used for violations, rename the atomic
IMA_MUST_MEASURE flag to IMA_MAY_EMIT_TOMTOU.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: scrub: improve tree block error reporting
References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit 28232909ba43561887508a6ef46d7f33a648f375 ]

[BUG]
When debugging a scrub related metadata error, it turns out that our
metadata error reporting is not ideal.

The only 3 error messages are:

- BTRFS error (device dm-2): bdev /dev/mapper/test-scratch1 errs: wr 0, rd 0, flush 0, corrupt 0, gen 1
  Showing we have metadata generation mismatch errors.

- BTRFS error (device dm-2): unable to fixup (regular) error at logical 7110656 on dev /dev/mapper/test-scratch1
  Showing which tree blocks are corrupted.

- BTRFS warning (device dm-2): checksum/header error at logical 24772608 on dev /dev/mapper/test-scratch2, physical 3801088: metadata node (level 1) in tree 5
  Showing which physical range the corrupted metadata is at.

We have to combine the above 3 to know we have a corrupted metadata with
generation mismatch.

And this is already the better case, if we have other problems, like
fsid mismatch, we can not even know the cause.

[CAUSE]
The problem is caused by the fact that, scrub_checksum_tree_block()
never outputs any error message.

It just return two bits for scrub: sblock->header_error, and
sblock->generation_error.

And later we report error in scrub_print_warning(), but unfortunately we
only have two bits, there is not really much thing we can done to print
any detailed errors.

[FIX]
This patch will do the following to enhance the error reporting of
metadata scrub:

- Add extra warning (ratelimited) for every error we hit
  This can help us to distinguish the different types of errors.
  Some errors can help us to know what's going wrong immediately,
  like bytenr mismatch.

- Re-order the checks
  Currently we check bytenr first, then immediately generation.
  This can lead to false generation mismatch reports, while the fsid
  mismatches.

Here is the new output for the bug I'm debugging (we forgot to
writeback tree blocks for commit roots):

 BTRFS warning (device dm-2): tree block 24117248 mirror 1 has bad fsid, has b77cd862-f150-4c71-90ec-7baf0544d83f want 17df6abf-23cd-445f-b350-5b3e40bfd2fc
 BTRFS warning (device dm-2): tree block 24117248 mirror 0 has bad fsid, has b77cd862-f150-4c71-90ec-7baf0544d83f want 17df6abf-23cd-445f-b350-5b3e40bfd2fc

Now we can immediately know it's some tree blocks didn't even get written
back, other than the original confusing generation mismatch.

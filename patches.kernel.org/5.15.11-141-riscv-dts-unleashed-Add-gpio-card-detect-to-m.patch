Subject: [PATCH] riscv: dts: unleashed: Add gpio card detect to mmc-spi-slot
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.11
Git-commit: 6331b8765cd0634a4e4cdcc1a6f1a74196616b94

commit 6331b8765cd0634a4e4cdcc1a6f1a74196616b94 upstream.

Per HiFive Unleashed schematics, the card detect signal of the
micro SD card is connected to gpio pin #11, which should be
reflected in the DT via the <gpios> property, as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc-spi-slot.txt.

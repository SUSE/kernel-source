Subject: [PATCH] usb: misc: onboard_hub: Invert driver registration order
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.8
Git-commit: e5854355d76b8d768cea8e4fc3ce6dfdba25518a

commit e5854355d76b8d768cea8e4fc3ce6dfdba25518a upstream.

The onboard_hub 'driver' consists of two drivers, a platform
driver and a USB driver. Currently when the onboard hub driver
is initialized it first registers the platform driver, then the
USB driver. This results in a race condition when the 'attach'
work is executed, which is scheduled when the platform device
is probed. The purpose of fhe 'attach' work is to bind elegible
USB hub devices to the onboard_hub USB driver. This fails if
the work runs before the USB driver has been registered.

Register the USB driver first, then the platform driver. This
increases the chances that the onboard_hub USB devices are probed
before their corresponding platform device, which the USB driver
tries to locate in _probe(). The driver already handles this
situation and defers probing if the onboard hub platform device
doesn't exist yet.

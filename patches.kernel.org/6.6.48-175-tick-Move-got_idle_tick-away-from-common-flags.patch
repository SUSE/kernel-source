Subject: [PATCH] tick: Move got_idle_tick away from common flags
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.48
Git-commit: 3ce74f1a8566dbbc9774f85fb0ce781fe290fd32

[ Upstream commit 3ce74f1a8566dbbc9774f85fb0ce781fe290fd32 ]

tick_nohz_idle_got_tick() is called by cpuidle_reflect() within the idle
loop with interrupts enabled. This function modifies the struct
tick_sched's bitfield "got_idle_tick". However this bitfield is stored
within the same mask as other bitfields that can be modified from
interrupts.

Fortunately so far it looks like the only race that can happen is while
writing ->got_idle_tick to 0, an interrupt fires and writes the
->idle_active field to 0. It's then possible that the interrupted write
to ->got_idle_tick writes back the old value of ->idle_active back to 1.

However if that happens, the worst possible outcome is that the time
spent between that interrupt and the upcoming call to
tick_nohz_idle_exit() is accounted as idle, which is negligible quantity.

Still all the bitfield writes within this struct tick_sched's shadow
mask should be IRQ-safe. Therefore move this bitfield out to its own
storage to avoid further suprises.

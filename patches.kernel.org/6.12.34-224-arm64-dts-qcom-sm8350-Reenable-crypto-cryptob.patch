Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8350: Reenable crypto & cryptobam
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.34
Git-commit: 75eefd474469abf95aa9ef6da8161d69f86b98b4

[ Upstream commit 75eefd474469abf95aa9ef6da8161d69f86b98b4 ]

When num-channels and qcom,num-ees is not provided in devicetree, the
driver will try to read these values from the registers during probe but
this fails if the interconnect is not on and then crashes the system.

So we can provide these properties in devicetree (queried after patching
BAM driver to enable the necessary interconnect) so we can probe
cryptobam without reading registers and then also use the QCE as
expected.

Fixes: f1040a7fe8f0 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sm8350: Add Crypto Engine support")

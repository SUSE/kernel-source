Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: abort transaction when sibling keys check fails for
 leaves
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.7
Git-commit: 9ae5afd02a03d4e22a17a9609b19400b77c36273

[ Upstream commit 9ae5afd02a03d4e22a17a9609b19400b77c36273 ]

If the sibling keys check fails before we move keys from one sibling
leaf to another, we are not aborting the transaction - we leave that to
some higher level caller of btrfs_search_slot() (or anything else that
uses it to insert items into a b+tree).

This means that the transaction abort will provide a stack trace that
omits the b+tree modification call chain. So change this to immediately
abort the transaction and therefore get a more useful stack trace that
shows us the call chain in the bt+tree modification code.

It's also important to immediately abort the transaction just in case
some higher level caller is not doing it, as this indicates a very
serious corruption and we should stop the possibility of doing further
damage.

Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/pseries: Fix hcall tracepoints with JUMP_LABEL=n
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.53
Git-commit: 750bd41aeaeb1f0e0128aa4f8fcd6dd759713641

[ Upstream commit 750bd41aeaeb1f0e0128aa4f8fcd6dd759713641 ]

With JUMP_LABEL=n, hcall_tracepoint_refcount's address is being tested
instead of its value. This results in the tracing slowpath always being
taken unnecessarily.

Fixes: 9a10ccb29c0a2 ("powerpc/pseries: move hcall_tracepoint_refcount out of .toc")

Subject: [PATCH] pmdomain: imx: Make imx pgc power domain also set the fwnode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.64
Git-commit: 374de39d38f97b0e58cfee88da590b2d056ccf7f

[ Upstream commit 374de39d38f97b0e58cfee88da590b2d056ccf7f ]

Currently, The imx pgc power domain doesn't set the fwnode
pointer, which results in supply regulator device can't get
consumer imx pgc power domain device from fwnode when creating
a link.

This causes the driver core to instead try to create a link
between the parent gpc device of imx pgc power domain device and
supply regulator device. However, at this point, the gpc device
has already been bound, and the link creation will fail. So adding
the fwnode pointer to the imx pgc power domain device will fix
this issue.

Subject: [PATCH] net: sparx5: Fix invalid timestamps
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.55
Git-commit: 151ac45348afc5b56baa584c7cd4876addf461ff

[ Upstream commit 151ac45348afc5b56baa584c7cd4876addf461ff ]

Bit 270-271 are occasionally unexpectedly set by the hardware. This issue
was observed with 10G SFPs causing huge time errors (> 30ms) in PTP. Only
30 bits are needed for the nanosecond part of the timestamp, clear 2 most
significant bits before extracting timestamp from the internal frame
header.

Fixes: 70dfe25cd866 ("net: sparx5: Update extraction/injection for timestamping")

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: Fix occasional boot hang for am3 usb
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.71
Git-commit: 9b6a51aab5f5f9f71d2fa16e8b4d530e1643dfcb

[ Upstream commit 9b6a51aab5f5f9f71d2fa16e8b4d530e1643dfcb ]

With subtle timings changes, we can now sometimes get an external abort on
non-linefetch error booting am3 devices at sysc_reset(). This is because
of a missing reset delay needed for the usb target module.

Looks like we never enabled the delay earlier for am3, although a similar
issue was seen earlier with a similar usb setup for dm814x as described in
commit ebf244148092 ("ARM: OMAP2+: Use srst_udelay for USB on dm814x").

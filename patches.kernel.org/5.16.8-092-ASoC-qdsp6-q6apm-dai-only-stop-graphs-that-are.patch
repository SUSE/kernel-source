Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: qdsp6: q6apm-dai: only stop graphs that are started
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.8
Git-commit: 8f2e5c65ec7534cce6d315fccf2c3aef023f68f0

commit 8f2e5c65ec7534cce6d315fccf2c3aef023f68f0 upstream.

Its possible that the sound card is just opened and closed without actually
playing stream, ex: if the audio file itself is missing.

Even in such cases we do call stop on graphs that are not yet started.
DSP can throw errors in such cases, so add a check to see if the graph
was started before stopping it.

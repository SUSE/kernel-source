Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ufs: cdns-pltfrm: Perform read back after writing
 HCLKDIV
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.3
Git-commit: b715c55daf598aac8fa339048e4ca8a0916b332e

[ Upstream commit b715c55daf598aac8fa339048e4ca8a0916b332e ]

Currently, HCLKDIV is written to and then completed with an mb().

mb() ensures that the write completes, but completion doesn't mean that it
isn't stored in a buffer somewhere. The recommendation for ensuring this
bit has taken effect on the device is to perform a read back to force it to
make it all the way to the device. This is documented in device-io.rst and
a talk by Will Deacon on this can be seen over here:

    https://youtu.be/i6DayghhA8Q?si=MiyxB5cKJXSaoc01&t=1678

Let's do that to ensure the bit hits the device. Because the mb()'s purpose
wasn't to add extra ordering (on top of the ordering guaranteed by
writel()/readl()), it can safely be removed.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: fix codec reset line polarity for
 CRD 3.0/3.1
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 1caf66104c02d327a2467a69ab18fb24b44e9715

[ Upstream commit 1caf66104c02d327a2467a69ab18fb24b44e9715 ]

The driver for the codec, when resetting the chip, first drives the line
low, and then high. This means that the line is active low. Change the
annotation in the DTS accordingly.

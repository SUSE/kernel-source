Subject: [PATCH] md: fix bi_status reporting in md_end_clone_io
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.65
Git-commit: 45b478951b2ba5aea70b2850c49c1aa83aedd0d2

commit 45b478951b2ba5aea70b2850c49c1aa83aedd0d2 upstream.

md_end_clone_io() may overwrite error status in orig_bio->bi_status with
BLK_STS_OK. This could happen when orig_bio has BIO_CHAIN (split by
md_submit_bio => bio_split_to_limits, for example). As a result, upper
layer may miss error reported from md (or the device) and consider the
failed IO was successful.

Fix this by only update orig_bio->bi_status when current bio reports
error and orig_bio is BLK_STS_OK. This is the same behavior as
__bio_chain_endio().

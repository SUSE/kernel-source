Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Bump sd->max_newidle_lb_cost when newidle balance
 fails
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.43
Git-commit: 155213a2aed42c85361bf4f5c817f5cb68951c3b

[ Upstream commit 155213a2aed42c85361bf4f5c817f5cb68951c3b ]

schbench (https://github.com/masoncl/schbench.git) is showing a
regression from previous production kernels that bisected down to:

sched/fair: Remove sysctl_sched_migration_cost condition (c5b0a7eefc)

The schbench command line was:

schbench -L -m 4 -M auto -t 256 -n 0 -r 0 -s 0

This creates 4 message threads pinned to CPUs 0-3, and 256x4 worker
threads spread across the rest of the CPUs.  Neither the worker threads
or the message threads do any work, they just wake each other up and go
back to sleep as soon as possible.

The end result is the first 4 CPUs are pegged waking up those 1024
workers, and the rest of the CPUs are constantly banging in and out of
idle.  If I take a v6.9 Linus kernel and revert that one commit,
performance goes from 3.4M RPS to 5.4M RPS.

schedstat shows there are ~100x  more new idle balance operations, and
profiling shows the worker threads are spending ~20% of their CPU time
on new idle balance.  schedstats also shows that almost all of these new
idle balance attemps are failing to find busy groups.

The fix used here is to crank up the cost of the newidle balance whenever it
fails.  Since we don't want sd->max_newidle_lb_cost to grow out of
control, this also changes update_newidle_cost() to use
sysctl_sched_migration_cost as the upper limit on max_newidle_lb_cost.

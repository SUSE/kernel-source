Subject: [PATCH] scripts/gdb/linux/symbols.py: address changes to
 module_sect_attrs

[ Upstream commit e0349c46cb4fbbb507fa34476bd70f9c82bad359 ]

When loading symbols from kernel modules we used to iterate
from 0 to module_sect_attrs::nsections, in order to
retrieve their name and address.

However module_sect_attrs::nsections has been removed from
the struct by a previous commit.

Re-arrange the iteration by accessing all items in
module_sect_attrs::grp::bin_attrs[] until NULL is found
(it's a NULL terminated array).

At the same time the symbol address cannot be extracted
from module_sect_attrs::attrs[]::address anymore because
it has also been deleted. Fetch it from
module_sect_attrs::grp::bin_attrs[]::private as described
in 4b2c11e4aaf7.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: correct Soundwire wakeup interrupt
 name
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.3
Git-commit: 5eafe69af43d77cb117f27201076ee50f48363f1

[ Upstream commit 5eafe69af43d77cb117f27201076ee50f48363f1 ]

The bindings expect second Soundwire interrupt to be "wakeup" (Linux
driver takes by index):

  sm8450-hdk.dtb: soundwire-controller@33b0000: interrupt-names:1: 'wakeup' was expected

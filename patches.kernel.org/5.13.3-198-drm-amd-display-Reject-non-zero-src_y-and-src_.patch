Subject: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Reject non-zero src_y and src_x for video
 planes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.3
Git-commit: c6c6a712199ab355ce333fa5764a59506bb107c1

commit c6c6a712199ab355ce333fa5764a59506bb107c1 upstream.

[Why]
This hasn't been well tested and leads to complete system hangs on DCN1
based systems, possibly others.

The system hang can be reproduced by gesturing the video on the YouTube
Android app on ChromeOS into full screen.

[How]
Reject atomic commits with non-zero drm_plane_state.src_x or src_y values.

v2:
 - Add code comment describing the reason we're rejecting non-zero
   src_x and src_y
 - Drop gerrit Change-Id
 - Add stable CC
 - Based on amd-staging-drm-next

v3: removed trailing whitespace

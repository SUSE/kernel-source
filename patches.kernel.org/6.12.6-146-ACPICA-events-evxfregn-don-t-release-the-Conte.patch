Subject: [PATCH] ACPICA: events/evxfregn: don't release the ContextMutex that
 was never acquired
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.6
Git-commit: c53d96a4481f42a1635b96d2c1acbb0a126bfd54

[ Upstream commit c53d96a4481f42a1635b96d2c1acbb0a126bfd54 ]

This bug was first introduced in c27f3d011b08, where the author of the
patch probably meant to do DeleteMutex instead of ReleaseMutex. The
mutex leak was noticed later on and fixed in e4dfe108371, but the bogus
MutexRelease line was never removed, so do it now.

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: release the dquot buf outside of qli_lock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: 1aacd3fac248902ea1f7607f2d12b93929a4833b

commit 1aacd3fac248902ea1f7607f2d12b93929a4833b upstream.

Lai Yi reported a lockdep complaint about circular locking:

 Chain exists of:
   &lp->qli_lock --> &bch->bc_lock --> &l->lock

  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----
   lock(&l->lock);
                                lock(&bch->bc_lock);
                                lock(&l->lock);
   lock(&lp->qli_lock);

I /think/ the problem here is that xfs_dquot_attach_buf during
quotacheck will release the buffer while it's holding the qli_lock.
Because this is a cached buffer, xfs_buf_rele_cached takes b_lock before
decrementing b_hold.  Other threads have taught lockdep that a locking
dependency chain is bp->b_lock -> bch->bc_lock -> l(ru)->lock; and that
another chain is l(ru)->lock -> lp->qli_lock.  Hence we do not want to
take b_lock while holding qli_lock.

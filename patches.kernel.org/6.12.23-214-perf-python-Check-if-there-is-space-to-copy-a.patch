Subject: [PATCH] perf python: Check if there is space to copy all the event
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.23

[ Upstream commit 89aaeaf84231157288035b366cb6300c1c6cac64 ]

The pyrf_event__new() method copies the event obtained from the perf
ring buffer to a structure that will then be turned into a python object
for further consumption, so it copies perf_event.header.size bytes to
its 'event' member:

  $ pahole -C pyrf_event /tmp/build/perf-tools-next/python/perf.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
  struct pyrf_event {
  	PyObject                   ob_base;              /*     0    16 */
  	struct evsel *             evsel;                /*    16     8 */
  	struct perf_sample         sample;               /*    24   312 */

  	/* XXX last struct has 7 bytes of padding, 2 holes */

  	/* --- cacheline 5 boundary (320 bytes) was 16 bytes ago --- */
  	union perf_event           event;                /*   336  4168 */

  	/* size: 4504, cachelines: 71, members: 4 */
  	/* member types with holes: 1, total: 2 */
  	/* paddings: 1, sum paddings: 7 */
  	/* last cacheline: 24 bytes */
  };

  $

It was doing so without checking if the event just obtained has more
than that space, fix it.

This isn't a proper, final solution, as we need to support larger
events, but for the time being we at least bounds check and document it.

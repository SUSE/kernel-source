Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/dcr: Use cmplwi instead of 3-argument cmpli

[ Upstream commit fef071be57dc43679a32d5b0e6ee176d6f12e9f2 ]

In dcr-low.S we use cmpli with three arguments, instead of four
arguments as defined in the ISA:

	cmpli	cr0,r3,1024

This appears to be a PPC440-ism, looking at the "PPC440x5 CPU Core
Userâ€™s Manual" it shows cmpli having no L field, but implied to be 0 due
to the core being 32-bit. It mentions that the ISA defines four
arguments and recommends using cmplwi.

It also corresponds to the old POWER instruction set, which had no L
field there, a reserved bit instead.

dcr-low.S is only built 32-bit, because it is only built when
DCR_NATIVE=y, which is only selected by 40x and 44x. Looking at the
generated code (with gcc/gas) we see cmplwi as expected.

Although gas is happy with the 3-argument version when building for
32-bit, the LLVM assembler is not and errors out with:

  arch/powerpc/sysdev/dcr-low.S:27:10: error: invalid operand for instruction
   cmpli 0,%r3,1024; ...
           ^

Switch to the cmplwi extended opcode, which avoids any confusion when
reading the ISA, fixes the issue with the LLVM assembler, and also means
the code could be built 64-bit in future (though that's very unlikely).

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath12k: fix failed to set mhi state error during reboot
 with hardware grouping
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.35
Git-commit: dce7aec6b1f74b0a46b901ab8de1f7bd0515f733

[ Upstream commit dce7aec6b1f74b0a46b901ab8de1f7bd0515f733 ]

With hardware grouping, during reboot, whenever a device is removed, it
powers down itself and all its partner devices in the same group. Now this
is done by all devices and hence there is multiple power down for devices
and hence the following error messages can be seen:

ath12k_pci 0002:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state POWER_OFF(3) in current mhi state (0x0)
ath12k_pci 0002:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state: POWER_OFF(3)
ath12k_pci 0002:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state DEINIT(1) in current mhi state (0x0)
ath12k_pci 0002:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state: DEINIT(1)
ath12k_pci 0003:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state POWER_OFF(3) in current mhi state (0x0)
ath12k_pci 0003:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state: POWER_OFF(3)
ath12k_pci 0003:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state DEINIT(1) in current mhi state (0x0)
ath12k_pci 0003:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state: DEINIT(1)
ath12k_pci 0004:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state POWER_OFF(3) in current mhi state (0x0)
ath12k_pci 0004:01:00.0: failed to set mhi state: POWER_OFF(3)

To prevent this, check if the ATH12K_PCI_FLAG_INIT_DONE flag is already
set before powering down. If it is set, it indicates that another partner
device has already performed the power down, and this device can skip this
step.

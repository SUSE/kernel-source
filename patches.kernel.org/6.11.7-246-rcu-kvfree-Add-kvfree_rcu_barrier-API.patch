Subject: [PATCH] rcu/kvfree: Add kvfree_rcu_barrier() API
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.7
Git-commit: 2b55d6a42d14c8675e38d6d9adca3014fdf01951

commit 2b55d6a42d14c8675e38d6d9adca3014fdf01951 upstream.

Add a kvfree_rcu_barrier() function. It waits until all
in-flight pointers are freed over RCU machinery. It does
not wait any GP completion and it is within its right to
return immediately if there are no outstanding pointers.

This function is useful when there is a need to guarantee
that a memory is fully freed before destroying memory caches.
For example, during unloading a kernel module.

Subject: [PATCH] perf record: Fix "read LOST count failed" msg with sample
 read
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 07d85ba9d04e1ebd282f656a29ddf08c5b7b32a2

[ Upstream commit 07d85ba9d04e1ebd282f656a29ddf08c5b7b32a2 ]

Hundreds of "read LOST count failed" error messages may be displayed,
when the below command is launched.

perf record -e '{cpu/mem-loads-aux/,cpu/event=0xcd,umask=0x1/}:S' -a

According to the commit 89e3106fa25fb1b6 ("libperf: Handle read format
in perf_evsel__read()"), the PERF_FORMAT_GROUP is only available for
the leader. However, the record__read_lost_samples() goes through every
entry of an evlist, which includes both leader and member. The member
event errors out and triggers the error message. Since there may be
hundreds of CPUs on a server, the message will be printed hundreds of
times, which is very annoying.

The message itself is correct, but the pr_err is a overkill. Other error
messages in the record__read_lost_samples() are all pr_debug. To make
the output format consistent, change the pr_err("read LOST count
failed\n"); to pr_debug("read LOST count failed\n");.
User can still get the message via -v option.

Subject: [PATCH] xfs: only remap the written blocks in
 xfs_reflink_end_cow_extent
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.17
Git-commit: 55f669f34184ecb25b8353f29c7f6f1ae5b313d1

commit 55f669f34184ecb25b8353f29c7f6f1ae5b313d1 upstream.

xfs_reflink_end_cow_extent looks up the COW extent and the data fork
extent at offset_fsb, and then proceeds to remap the common subset
between the two.

It does however not limit the remapped extent to the passed in
[*offset_fsbm end_fsb] range and thus potentially remaps more blocks than
the one handled by the current I/O completion.  This means that with
sufficiently large data and COW extents we could be remapping COW fork
mappings that have not been written to, leading to a stale data exposure
on a powerfail event.

We use to have a xfs_trim_range to make the remap fit the I/O completion
range, but that got (apparently accidentally) removed in commit
df2fd88f8ac7 ("xfs: rewrite xfs_reflink_end_cow to use intents").

Note that I've only found this by code inspection, and a test case would
probably require very specific delay and error injection.

Subject: [PATCH] power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Make "T3 MRD"
 no_battery_list DMI entry more generic
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: 3a06b912a5ce494d7b7300b12719c562be7b566f

[ Upstream commit 3a06b912a5ce494d7b7300b12719c562be7b566f ]

It turns out that the "T3 MRD" DMI_BOARD_NAME value is used in a lot of
different Cherry Trail x5-z8300 / x5-z8350 based Mini-PC / HDMI-stick
models from Ace PC / Meegopad / MinisForum / Wintel (and likely also
other vendors).

Most of the other DMI strings on these boxes unfortunately contain various
generic values like "Default string" or "$(DEFAULT_STRING)", so we cannot
match on them. These devices do have their chassis-type correctly set to a
value of "3" (desktop) which is a pleasant surprise, so also match on that.

This should avoid the quirk accidentally also getting applied to laptops /
tablets (which do actually have a battery). Although in my quite large
database of Bay and Cherry Trail based devices DMIdecode dumps I don't
have any laptops / tables with a board-name of "T3 MRD", so this should
not be an issue.

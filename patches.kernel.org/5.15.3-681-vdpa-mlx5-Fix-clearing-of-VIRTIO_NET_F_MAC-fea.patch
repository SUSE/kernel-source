Subject: [PATCH] vdpa/mlx5: Fix clearing of VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC feature bit
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: ef76eb83a17e803a66b64ac95b36ae48b3d17c22

[ Upstream commit ef76eb83a17e803a66b64ac95b36ae48b3d17c22 ]

Cited patch in the fixes tag clears the features bit during reset.
mlx5 vdpa device feature bits are static decided by device capabilities.
These feature bits (including VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC) are initialized during
device addition time.

Clearing features bit in reset callback cleared the VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC. Due
to this, MAC address provided by the device is not honored.

Fix it by not clearing the static feature bits during reset.

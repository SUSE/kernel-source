Subject: [PATCH] perf trace: Do not lose last events in a race
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: 3fd7c36973a250e17a4ee305a31545a9426021f4

[ Upstream commit 3fd7c36973a250e17a4ee305a31545a9426021f4 ]

If a perf trace event selector specifies a maximum number of events to output
(i.e., "/nr=N/" syntax), the event printing handler, trace__event_handler,
disables the event selector after the maximum number events are
printed.

Furthermore, trace__event_handler checked if the event selector was
disabled before doing any work. This avoided exceeding the maximum
number of events to print if more events were in the buffer before the
selector was disabled.

However, the event selector can be disabled for reasons other than
exceeding the maximum number of events. In particular, when the traced
subprocess exits, the main loop disables all event selectors. This meant
the last events of a traced subprocess might be lost to the printing
handler's short-circuiting logic.

This nondeterministic problem could be seen by running the following many times:

  $ perf trace -e syscalls:sys_enter_exit_group true

trace__event_handler should simply check for exceeding the maximum number of
events to print rather than the state of the event selector.

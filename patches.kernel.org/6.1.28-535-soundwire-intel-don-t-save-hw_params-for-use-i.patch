Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: intel: don't save hw_params for use in prepare

[ Upstream commit 0a0d1740bd8fd7dafb81fcb102fb5d0b83b1ce73 ]

The existing code copies the hw_params pointer and reuses it later in
.prepare, specifically to re-initialize the ALH DMA channel
information that's lost in suspend-resume cycles.

This is not needed, we can directly access the information from the
substream/rtd - as done for the HDAudio DAIs in
sound/soc/sof/intel/hda-dai.c

In addition, using the saved pointer causes the suspend-resume test
cases to fail on specific platforms, depending on which version of GCC
is used. Péter Ujfalusi and I have spent long hours to root-cause this
problem that was reported by the Intel CI first with 6.2-rc1 and again
v6.3-rc1. In the latter case we were lucky that the problem was 100%
reproducible on local test devices, and found out that adding a
dev_dbg() or adding a call to usleep_range() just before accessing the
saved pointer "fixed" the issue. With errors appearing just by
changing the compiler version or minor changes in the code generated,
clearly we have a memory management Heisenbug.

The root-cause seems to be that the hw_params pointer is not
persistent. The soc-pcm code allocates the hw_params structure on the
stack, and passes it to the BE dailink hw_params and DAIs
hw_params. Saving such a pointer and reusing it later during the
.prepare stage cannot possibly work reliably, it's broken-by-design
since v5.10. It's astonishing that the problem was not seen earlier.

This simple fix will have to be back-ported to -stable, due to changes
to avoid the use of the get/set_dmadata routines this patch will only
apply on kernels older than v6.1.

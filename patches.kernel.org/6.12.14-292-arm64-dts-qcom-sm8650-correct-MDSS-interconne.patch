Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: correct MDSS interconnects
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.14
Git-commit: 9fa33cbca3d2842f1f47ed4e5f6574e611dae32b

commit 9fa33cbca3d2842f1f47ed4e5f6574e611dae32b upstream.

SM8650 lists two interconnects for the display subsystem, mdp0-mem
(between MDP and LLCC) and mdp1-mem (between LLCC and EBI, memory).
The second interconnect is a misuse. mdpN-mem paths should be used for
several outboud MDP interconnects rather than the path between LLCC and
memory. This kind of misuse can result in bandwidth underflows, possibly
degrading picture quality as the required memory bandwidth is divided
between all mdpN-mem paths (and LLCC-EBI should not be a part of such
division).

Drop the second path and use direct MDP-EBI path for mdp0-mem until we
support separate MDP-LLCC and LLCC-EBI paths.

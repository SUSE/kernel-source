Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Mark SDHCI hosts as cache-coherent
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: 827f5fc8d912203c1f971e47d61130b13c6820ba

[ Upstream commit 827f5fc8d912203c1f971e47d61130b13c6820ba ]

The SDHCI hosts on SC7280 are cache-coherent, just like on most fairly
recent Qualcomm SoCs. Mark them as such.

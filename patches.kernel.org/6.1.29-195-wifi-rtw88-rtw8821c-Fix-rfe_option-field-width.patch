Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtw88: rtw8821c: Fix rfe_option field width
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 14705f969d98187a1cc2682e0c9bd2e230b8098f

[ Upstream commit 14705f969d98187a1cc2682e0c9bd2e230b8098f ]

On my RTW8821CU chipset rfe_option reads as 0x22. Looking at the
vendor driver suggests that the field width of rfe_option is 5 bit,
so rfe_option should be masked with 0x1f.

Without this the rfe_option comparisons with 2 further down the
driver evaluate as false when they should really evaluate as true.
The effect is that 2G channels do not work.

rfe_option is also used as an array index into rtw8821c_rfe_defs[].
rtw8821c_rfe_defs[34] (0x22) was added as part of adding USB support,
likely because rfe_option reads as 0x22. As this now becomes 0x2,
rtw8821c_rfe_defs[34] is no longer used and can be removed.

Note that this might not be the whole truth. In the vendor driver
there are indeed places where the unmasked rfe_option value is used.
However, the driver has several places where rfe_option is tested
with the pattern if (rfe_option == 2 || rfe_option == 0x22) or
if (rfe_option == 4 || rfe_option == 0x24), so that rfe_option BIT(5)
has no influence on the code path taken. We therefore mask BIT(5)
out from rfe_option entirely until this assumption is proved wrong
by some chip variant we do not know yet.

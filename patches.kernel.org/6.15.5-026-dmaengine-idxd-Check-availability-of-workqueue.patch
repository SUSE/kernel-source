Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: idxd: Check availability of workqueue allocated by
 idxd wq driver before using
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.5
Git-commit: 17502e7d7b7113346296f6758324798d536c31fd

[ Upstream commit 17502e7d7b7113346296f6758324798d536c31fd ]

Running IDXD workloads in a container with the /dev directory mounted can
trigger a call trace or even a kernel panic when the parent process of the
container is terminated.

This issue occurs because, under certain configurations, Docker does not
properly propagate the mount replica back to the original mount point.

In this case, when the user driver detaches, the WQ is destroyed but it
still calls destroy_workqueue() attempting to completes all pending work.
It's necessary to check wq->wq and skip the drain if it no longer exists.

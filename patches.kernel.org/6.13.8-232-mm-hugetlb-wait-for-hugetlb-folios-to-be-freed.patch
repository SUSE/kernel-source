Subject: [PATCH] mm/hugetlb: wait for hugetlb folios to be freed
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.8
Git-commit: 67bab13307c83fb742c2556b06cdc39dbad27f07

[ Upstream commit 67bab13307c83fb742c2556b06cdc39dbad27f07 ]

Since the introduction of commit c77c0a8ac4c52 ("mm/hugetlb: defer freeing
of huge pages if in non-task context"), which supports deferring the
freeing of hugetlb pages, the allocation of contiguous memory through
cma_alloc() may fail probabilistically.

In the CMA allocation process, if it is found that the CMA area is
occupied by in-use hugetlb folios, these in-use hugetlb folios need to be
migrated to another location.  When there are no available hugetlb folios
in the free hugetlb pool during the migration of in-use hugetlb folios,
new folios are allocated from the buddy system.  A temporary state is set
on the newly allocated folio.  Upon completion of the hugetlb folio
migration, the temporary state is transferred from the new folios to the
old folios.  Normally, when the old folios with the temporary state are
freed, it is directly released back to the buddy system.  However, due to
the deferred freeing of hugetlb pages, the PageBuddy() check fails,
ultimately leading to the failure of cma_alloc().

Here is a simplified call trace illustrating the process:
cma_alloc()
    ->__alloc_contig_migrate_range() // Migrate in-use hugetlb folios
        ->unmap_and_move_huge_page()
            ->folio_putback_hugetlb() // Free old folios
    ->test_pages_isolated()
        ->__test_page_isolated_in_pageblock()
             ->PageBuddy(page) // Check if the page is in buddy

To resolve this issue, we have implemented a function named
wait_for_freed_hugetlb_folios().  This function ensures that the hugetlb
folios are properly released back to the buddy system after their
migration is completed.  By invoking wait_for_freed_hugetlb_folios()
before calling PageBuddy(), we ensure that PageBuddy() will succeed.

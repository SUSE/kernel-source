Subject: [PATCH] HID: multitouch: Add quirk for Logitech Bolt receiver w/ Casa
 touchpad
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.9
Git-commit: 526748b925185e95f1415900ee13c2469d4b64cc

[ Upstream commit 526748b925185e95f1415900ee13c2469d4b64cc ]

The Logitech Casa Touchpad does not reliably send touch release signals
when communicating through the Logitech Bolt wireless-to-USB receiver.

Adjusting the device class to add MT_QUIRK_NOT_SEEN_MEANS_UP to make
sure that no touches become stuck, MT_QUIRK_FORCE_MULTI_INPUT is not
needed, but harmless.

Linux does not have information on which devices are connected to the
Bolt receiver, so we have to enable this for the entire device.

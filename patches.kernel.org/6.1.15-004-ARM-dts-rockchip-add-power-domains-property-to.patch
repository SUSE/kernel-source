Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rockchip: add power-domains property to dp node on
 rk3288
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.15
Git-commit: 80422339a75088322b4d3884bd12fa0fe5d11050

[ Upstream commit 80422339a75088322b4d3884bd12fa0fe5d11050 ]

The clocks in the Rockchip rk3288 DisplayPort node are
included in the power-domain@RK3288_PD_VIO logic, but the
power-domains property in the dp node is missing, so fix it.

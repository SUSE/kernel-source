Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix compatible for Bluetooth on
 rk3566-anbernic
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.4
Git-commit: a325956fa7048906e26a4535ac2e87e111788fe8

[ Upstream commit a325956fa7048906e26a4535ac2e87e111788fe8 ]

The realtek Bluetooth module uses the same driver as the
realtek,rtl8822cs-bt and the realtek,rtl8723bs-bt, however by selecting
the 8723bs advanced power saving features are disabled that appear
to interfere with normal operation of the bluetooth module. This
change switches the compatible string to disable power saving. Without
this patch evtest of a paired bluetooth controller fails, with this
patch the controller operates as expected.

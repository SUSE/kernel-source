Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: Fix TPM schema violations
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: 8412c47d68436b9f9a260039a4a773daa6824925

[ Upstream commit 8412c47d68436b9f9a260039a4a773daa6824925 ]

Since commit 26c9d152ebf3 ("dt-bindings: tpm: Consolidate TCG TIS
bindings"), several issues are reported by "make dtbs_check" for ARM
devicetrees:

The nodename needs to be "tpm@0" rather than "tpmdev@0" and the
compatible property needs to contain the chip's name in addition to the
generic "tcg,tpm_tis-spi" or "tcg,tpm-tis-i2c":

  tpmdev@0: $nodename:0: 'tpmdev@0' does not match '^tpm(@[0-9a-f]+)?$'
        from schema $id: http://devicetree.org/schemas/tpm/tcg,tpm_tis-spi.yaml#

  tpm@2e: compatible: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
        ['tcg,tpm-tis-i2c'] is too short
        from schema $id: http://devicetree.org/schemas/tpm/tcg,tpm-tis-i2c.yaml#

Fix these schema violations.

Aspeed Facebook BMCs use an Infineon SLB9670:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZZT4%2Fw2eVzMhtsPx@fedora/
https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZZTS0p1hdAchIbKp@heinlein.vulture-banana.ts.net/

Aspeed Tacoma uses a Nuvoton NPCT75X per commit 39d8a73c53a2 ("ARM: dts:
aspeed: tacoma: Add TPM").

phyGATE-Tauri uses an Infineon SLB9670:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/ab45c82485fa272f74adf560cbb58ee60cc42689.camel@phytec.de/

A single schema violation remains in am335x-moxa-uc-2100-common.dtsi
because it is unknown which chip is used on the board.  The devicetree's
author has been asked for clarification but has not responded so far:

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: correct TX Soundwire clock
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.14
Git-commit: 20e886590a310665244a354e3b693b881544edec

[ Upstream commit 20e886590a310665244a354e3b693b881544edec ]

The TX Soundwire controller should take clock from TX macro codec, not
VA macro codec clock, otherwise the clock stays disabled.  This looks
like a copy-paste issue, because the SC8280xp code uses here correctly
clock from TX macro.  The VA macro clock is already consumed by TX macro
codec, thus it won't be disabled by this change.

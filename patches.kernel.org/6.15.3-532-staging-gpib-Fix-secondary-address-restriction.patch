Subject: [PATCH] staging: gpib: Fix secondary address restriction
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: 5aac95320d0f17f1098960e903ce5e087f42bc70

[ Upstream commit 5aac95320d0f17f1098960e903ce5e087f42bc70 ]

GPIB secondary addresses have valid values between 0 and 31
inclusive. The Make Secondary Address function MSA, used to form
the protocol byte, was using the gpib_address_restrict function
erroneously restricting the address range to 0 through 30.

Remove the call to gpib_address_restrict and simply trim the
address to 5 bits.

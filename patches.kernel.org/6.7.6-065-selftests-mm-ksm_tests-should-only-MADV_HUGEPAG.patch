Subject: [PATCH] selftests/mm: ksm_tests should only MADV_HUGEPAGE valid
 memory
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.6
Git-commit: d021b442cf312664811783e92b3d5e4548e92a53

commit d021b442cf312664811783e92b3d5e4548e92a53 upstream.

ksm_tests was previously mmapping a region of memory, aligning the
returned pointer to a PMD boundary, then setting MADV_HUGEPAGE, but was
setting it past the end of the mmapped area due to not taking the pointer
alignment into consideration.  Fix this behaviour.

Up until commit efa7df3e3bb5 ("mm: align larger anonymous mappings on THP
boundaries"), this buggy behavior was (usually) masked because the
alignment difference was always less than PMD-size.  But since the
mentioned commit, `ksm_tests -H -s 100` started failing.

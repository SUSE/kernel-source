Subject: [PATCH] fbcon: Fix outdated registered_fb reference in comment
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: 0f168e7be696a17487e83d1d47e5a408a181080f

[ Upstream commit 0f168e7be696a17487e83d1d47e5a408a181080f ]

The variable was renamed to fbcon_registered_fb, but this comment was
not updated along with the change. Correct it to avoid confusion.

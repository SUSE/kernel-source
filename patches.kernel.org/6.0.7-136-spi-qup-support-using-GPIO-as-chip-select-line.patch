Subject: [PATCH] spi: qup: support using GPIO as chip select line
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.7
Git-commit: b40af6183b685b0cf7870987b858de0d48db9ea0

[ Upstream commit b40af6183b685b0cf7870987b858de0d48db9ea0 ]

Most of the device with QUP SPI adapter are actually using GPIO-s for
chip select.

However, this stopped working after ("spi: Retire legacy GPIO handling")
as it introduced a check on ->use_gpio_descriptors flag and since spi-qup
driver does not set the flag it meant that all of boards using GPIO-s and
with QUP adapter SPI devices stopped working.

So, to enable using GPIO-s again set ->use_gpio_descriptors to true and
populate ->max_native_cs.

Subject: [PATCH] ubsan: integer-overflow: depend on BROKEN to keep this out of
 CI
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.37
Git-commit: d6a0e0bfecccdcecb08defe75a137c7262352102

[ Upstream commit d6a0e0bfecccdcecb08defe75a137c7262352102 ]

Depending on !COMPILE_TEST isn't sufficient to keep this feature out of
CI because we can't stop it from being included in randconfig builds.
This feature is still highly experimental, and is developed in lock-step
with Clang's Overflow Behavior Types[1]. Depend on BROKEN to keep it
from being enabled by anyone not expecting it.

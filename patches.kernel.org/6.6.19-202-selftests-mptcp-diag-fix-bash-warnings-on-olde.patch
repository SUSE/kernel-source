Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: diag: fix bash warnings on older kernels
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: 694bd45980a61045eb5ec07799e3b94c76db830e

commit 694bd45980a61045eb5ec07799e3b94c76db830e upstream.

Since the 'Fixes' commit mentioned below, the command that is executed
in __chk_nr() helper can return nothing if the feature is not supported.
This is the case when the MPTCP CURRESTAB counter is not supported.

To avoid this warning ...

  ./diag.sh: line 65: [: !=: unary operator expected

... we just need to surround '$nr' with double quotes, to support an
empty string when the feature is not supported.

Fixes: 81ab772819da ("selftests: mptcp: diag: check CURRESTAB counters")

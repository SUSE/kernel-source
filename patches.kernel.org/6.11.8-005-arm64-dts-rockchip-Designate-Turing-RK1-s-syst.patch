Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Designate Turing RK1's system power
 controller
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: 875ea82c75f56697fa500f30fabaa49f82f9b229

[ Upstream commit 875ea82c75f56697fa500f30fabaa49f82f9b229 ]

Currently, the Turing RK1 board reboots when told to power off.

Resolve this by designating the RK806 as the system power controller, so
that the relevant driver can handle system shutdown requests.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: samsung: exynos4210-i9100: Fix LCD screen's
 physical size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.56
Git-commit: b3f3fc32e5ff1e848555af8616318cc667457f90

[ Upstream commit b3f3fc32e5ff1e848555af8616318cc667457f90 ]

The previous values were completely bogus, and resulted in the computed
DPI ratio being much lower than reality, causing applications and UIs to
misbehave.

The new values were measured by myself with a ruler.

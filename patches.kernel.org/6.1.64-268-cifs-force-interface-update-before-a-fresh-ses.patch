Subject: [PATCH] cifs: force interface update before a fresh session setup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.64
Git-commit: d9a6d78096056a3cb5c5f07a730ab92f2f9ac4e6

commit d9a6d78096056a3cb5c5f07a730ab92f2f9ac4e6 upstream.

During a session reconnect, it is possible that the
server moved to another physical server (happens in case
of Azure files). So at this time, force a query of server
interfaces again (in case of multichannel session), such
that the secondary channels connect to the right
IP addresses (possibly updated now).

Subject: [PATCH] drm/bridge: Fixed a DP link training bug
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.44
Git-commit: ca077ff8cac5af8a5a3c476983a6dd54aa3511b7

[ Upstream commit ca077ff8cac5af8a5a3c476983a6dd54aa3511b7 ]

To have better compatibility for DP sink, there is a retry mechanism
for the link training process to switch between different training process.
The original driver code doesn't reset the retry counter when training
state is pass. If the system triggers link training over 3 times,
there will be a chance to causes the driver to use the wrong training
method and return a training fail result.

To Fix this, we reset the retry counter when training state is pass
each time.

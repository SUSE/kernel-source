Subject: [PATCH] net: hsr: Properly parse HSRv1 supervisor frames.
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.6
Git-commit: 295de650d3aaf9e50258465c5f1c84b465d836f6

[ Upstream commit 295de650d3aaf9e50258465c5f1c84b465d836f6 ]

While adding support for parsing the redbox supervision frames, the
author added `pull_size' and `total_pull_size' to track the amount of
bytes that were pulled from the skb during while parsing the skb so it
can be reverted/ pushed back at the end.
In the process probably copy&paste error occurred and for the HSRv1 case
the ethhdr was used instead of the hsr_tag. Later the hsr_tag was used
instead of hsr_sup_tag. The later error didn't matter because both
structs have the size so HSRv0 was still working. It broke however HSRv1
parsing because struct ethhdr is larger than struct hsr_tag.

Reinstate the old pulling flow and pull first ethhdr, hsr_tag in v1 case
followed by hsr_sup_tag.

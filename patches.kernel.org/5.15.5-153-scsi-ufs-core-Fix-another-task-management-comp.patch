Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ufs: core: Fix another task management completion race
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.5
Git-commit: 5cb37a26355d79ab290220677b1b57d28e99a895

[ Upstream commit 5cb37a26355d79ab290220677b1b57d28e99a895 ]

hba->outstanding_tasks, which is read under host_lock spinlock, tells the
interrupt handler what task management tags are in use by the driver.  The
doorbell register bits indicate which tags are in use by the hardware.  A
doorbell bit that is 0 is because the bit has yet to be set by the driver,
or because the task is complete. It is only possible to disambiguate the 2
cases, if reading/writing the doorbell register is synchronized with
reading/writing hba->outstanding_tasks.

For that reason, reading REG_UTP_TASK_REQ_DOOR_BELL must be done under
spinlock.

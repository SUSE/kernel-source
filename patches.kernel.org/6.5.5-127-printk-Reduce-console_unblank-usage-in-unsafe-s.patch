Subject: [PATCH] printk: Reduce console_unblank() usage in unsafe scenarios
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.5
Git-commit: 7b23a66db55ed0a55b020e913f0d6f6d52a1ad2c

[ Upstream commit 7b23a66db55ed0a55b020e913f0d6f6d52a1ad2c ]

A semaphore is not NMI-safe, even when using down_trylock(). Both
down_trylock() and up() are using internal spinlocks and up()
might even call wake_up_process().

In the panic() code path it gets even worse because the internal
spinlocks of the semaphore may have been taken by a CPU that has
been stopped.

To reduce the risk of deadlocks caused by the console semaphore in
the panic path, make the following changes:

- First check if any consoles have implemented the unblank()
  callback. If not, then there is no reason to take the console
  semaphore anyway. (This check is also useful for the non-panic
  path since the locking/unlocking of the console lock can be
  quite expensive due to console printing.)

- If the panic path is in NMI context, bail out without attempting
  to take the console semaphore or calling any unblank() callbacks.
  Bailing out is acceptable because console_unblank() would already
  bail out if the console semaphore is contended. The alternative of
  ignoring the console semaphore and calling the unblank() callbacks
  anyway is a bad idea because these callbacks are also not NMI-safe.

If consoles with unblank() callbacks exist and console_unblank() is
called from a non-NMI panic context, it will still attempt a
down_trylock(). This could still result in a deadlock if one of the
stopped CPUs is holding the semaphore internal spinlock. But this
is a risk that the kernel has been (and continues to be) willing
to take.

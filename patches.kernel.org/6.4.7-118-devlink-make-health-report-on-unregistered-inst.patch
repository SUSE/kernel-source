Subject: [PATCH] devlink: make health report on unregistered instance warn
 just once
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.7
Git-commit: 6f4b98147b8dfcabacb19b5c6abd087af66d0049

[ Upstream commit 6f4b98147b8dfcabacb19b5c6abd087af66d0049 ]

Devlink health is involved in error recovery. Machines in bad
state tend to be fairly unreliable, and occasionally get stuck
in error loops. Even with a reasonable grace period devlink health
may get a thousand reports in an hour.

In case of reporting on an unregistered devlink instance
the subsequent reports don't add much value. Switch to
WARN_ON_ONCE() to avoid flooding dmesg and fleet monitoring
dashboards.

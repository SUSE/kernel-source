Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Turn NEC specific quirk for handling Stop Endpoint
 errors generic
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.7
Git-commit: e21ebe51af688eb98fd6269240212a3c7300deea

commit e21ebe51af688eb98fd6269240212a3c7300deea upstream.

xHC hosts from several vendors have the same issue where endpoints start
so slowly that a later queued 'Stop Endpoint' command may complete before
endpoint is up and running.

The 'Stop Endpoint' command fails with context state error as the endpoint
still appears as  stopped.

See commit 42b758137601 ("usb: xhci: Limit Stop Endpoint retries") for
details

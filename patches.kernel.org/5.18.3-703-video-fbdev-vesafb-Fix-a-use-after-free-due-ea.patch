Subject: [PATCH] video: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info
 cleanup
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: acde4003efc16480375543638484d8f13f2e99a3

[ Upstream commit acde4003efc16480375543638484d8f13f2e99a3 ]

Commit b3c9a924aab6 ("fbdev: vesafb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather
than .remove") fixed a use-after-free error due the vesafb driver freeing
the fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.

This can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove
callback, since the former tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.

But that change didn't take into account that another possible scenario is
that .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback. For example, if no
process has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.

If that's the case, fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is
called, making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that
to no longer be valid.

To prevent that, move the expression containing the info->par to happen
before the unregister_framebuffer() function call.

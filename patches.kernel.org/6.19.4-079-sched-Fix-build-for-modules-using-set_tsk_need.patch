Subject: [PATCH] sched: Fix build for modules using set_tsk_need_resched()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: 8d737320166bd145af70a3133a9964b00ca81cba

[ Upstream commit 8d737320166bd145af70a3133a9964b00ca81cba ]

Commit adcc3bfa8806 ("sched: Adapt sched tracepoints for RV task model")
added a tracepoint to the need_resched action that can be triggered also
by set_tsk_need_resched.
This function was previously accessible from out-of-tree modules but
it's no longer available because the __trace_set_need_resched() symbol
is not exported (together with the tracepoint itself, which was exported
in a separate patch) and building such modules fails.

Export __trace_set_need_resched to modules to fix those build issues.

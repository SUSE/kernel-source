Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm630: don't use underscore in node name
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.6
Git-commit: 639dfdbecd88ec05bda87b1d5d419afad50af21c

[ Upstream commit 639dfdbecd88ec05bda87b1d5d419afad50af21c ]

We have underscore (_) in node name so fix that up as well.

Fix this by changing node name to use dash (-)

Subject: [PATCH] fadump: reserve param area if below boot_mem_top
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: fb90dca828b6070709093934c6dec56489a2d91d

[ Upstream commit fb90dca828b6070709093934c6dec56489a2d91d ]

The param area is a memory region where the kernel places additional
command-line arguments for fadump kernel. Currently, the param memory
area is reserved in fadump kernel if it is above boot_mem_top. However,
it should be reserved if it is below boot_mem_top because the fadump
kernel already reserves memory from boot_mem_top to the end of DRAM.

Currently, there is no impact from not reserving param memory if it is
below boot_mem_top, as it is not used after the early boot phase of the
fadump kernel. However, if this changes in the future, it could lead to
issues in the fadump kernel.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Drop regulator-init-microvolt from two
 boards
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: 98c3f4a2d61a29a53244ce45e50655140bd47afb

[ Upstream commit 98c3f4a2d61a29a53244ce45e50655140bd47afb ]

rk3568-roc-pc and rk3588-toybrick-x0 re-introduced this property despite
previous patches removing older instances already.

regulator-init-microvolt is not part of any regulator binding and is
only used in the Rockchip vendor kernel. So drop it.

It is used by u-boot in some places to setup initial regulator-state,
but that should happen in the existing -u-boot devicetree additions.

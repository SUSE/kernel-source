Subject: [PATCH] xfs: restrict when we try to align cow fork delalloc to
 cowextsz hints
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.58
Git-commit: 288e1f693f04e66be99f27e7cbe4a45936a66745

commit 288e1f693f04e66be99f27e7cbe4a45936a66745 upstream.

xfs/205 produces the following failure when always_cow is enabled:

This is the result of overly aggressive attempts to align cow fork
delalloc reservations to the CoW extent size hint.  Looking at the trace
data, we're trying to append a single fsblock to the "fred" file.
Trying to create a speculative post-eof reservation fails because
there's not enough space.

We then set @prealloc_blocks to zero and try again, but the cowextsz
alignment code triggers, which expands our request for a 1-fsblock
reservation into a 39-block reservation.  There's not enough space for
that, so the whole write fails with ENOSPC even though there's
sufficient space in the filesystem to allocate the single block that we
need to land the write.

There are two things wrong here -- first, we shouldn't be attempting
speculative preallocations beyond what was requested when we're low on
space.  Second, if we've already computed a posteof preallocation, we
shouldn't bother trying to align that to the cowextsize hint.

Fix both of these problems by adding a flag that only enables the
expansion of the delalloc reservation to the cowextsize if we're doing a
non-extending write, and only if we're not doing an ENOSPC retry.  This
requires us to move the ENOSPC retry logic to xfs_bmapi_reserve_delalloc.

I probably should have caught this six years ago when 6ca30729c206d was
being reviewed, but oh well.  Update the comments to reflect what the
code does now.

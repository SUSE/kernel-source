Subject: [PATCH] pinctrl: qcom: spmi: fix debugfs drive strength
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.64
Git-commit: 6bc0ebfb1d920f13c522545f114cdabb49e9408a

commit 6bc0ebfb1d920f13c522545f114cdabb49e9408a upstream.

Commit 723e8462a4fe ("pinctrl: qcom: spmi-gpio: Fix the GPIO strength
mapping") fixed a long-standing issue in the Qualcomm SPMI PMIC gpio
driver which had the 'low' and 'high' drive strength settings switched
but failed to update the debugfs interface which still gets this wrong.

Fix the debugfs code so that the exported values match the hardware
settings.

Note that this probably means that most devicetrees that try to describe
the firmware settings got this wrong if the settings were derived from
debugfs. Before the above mentioned commit the settings would have
actually matched the firmware settings even if they were described
incorrectly, but now they are inverted.

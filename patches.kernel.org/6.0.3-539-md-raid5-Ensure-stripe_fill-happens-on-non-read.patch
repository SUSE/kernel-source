Subject: [PATCH] md/raid5: Ensure stripe_fill happens on non-read IO with
 journal
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.3
Git-commit: e2eed85bc75138a9eeb63863d20f8904ac42a577

[ Upstream commit e2eed85bc75138a9eeb63863d20f8904ac42a577 ]

When doing degrade/recover tests using the journal a kernel BUG
is hit at drivers/md/raid5.c:4381 in handle_parity_checks5():

  BUG_ON(!test_bit(R5_UPTODATE, &dev->flags));

This was found to occur because handle_stripe_fill() was skipped
for stripes in the journal due to a condition in that function.
Thus blocks were not fetched and R5_UPTODATE was not set when
the code reached handle_parity_checks5().

To fix this, don't skip handle_stripe_fill() unless the stripe is
for read.

Fixes: 07e83364845e ("md/r5cache: shift complex rmw from read path to write path")

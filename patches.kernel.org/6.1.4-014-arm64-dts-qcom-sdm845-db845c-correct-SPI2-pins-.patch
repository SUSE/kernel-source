Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-db845c: correct SPI2 pins drive
 strength
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.4
Git-commit: 9905370560d9c29adc15f4937c5a0c0dac05f0b4

commit 9905370560d9c29adc15f4937c5a0c0dac05f0b4 upstream.

The pin configuration (done with generic pin controller helpers and
as expressed by bindings) requires children nodes with either:
1. "pins" property and the actual configuration,
2. another set of nodes with above point.

The qup_spi2_default pin configuration uses alreaady the second method
with a "pinmux" child, so configure drive-strength similarly in
"pinconf".  Otherwise the PIN drive strength would not be applied.

Fixes: 8d23a0040475 ("arm64: dts: qcom: db845c: add Low speed expansion i2c and spi nodes")

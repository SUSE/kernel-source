Subject: [PATCH] perf vendor events power9: Remove UTF-8 characters from JSON
 files
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.29
Git-commit: 5d9df8731c0941f3add30f96745a62586a0c9d52

[ Upstream commit 5d9df8731c0941f3add30f96745a62586a0c9d52 ]

Commit 3c22ba5243040c13 ("perf vendor events powerpc: Update POWER9
events") added and updated power9 PMU JSON events. However some of the
JSON events which are part of other.json and pipeline.json files,
contains UTF-8 characters in their brief description.  Having UTF-8
character could breaks the perf build on some distros.

Fix this issue by removing the UTF-8 characters from other.json and
pipeline.json files.

Result without the fix:

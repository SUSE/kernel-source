Subject: [PATCH] video: fbdev: offb: Include missing linux/platform_device.h
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: ebef8abc963b9e537c0a0d619dd8faf1b8f2b183

[ Upstream commit ebef8abc963b9e537c0a0d619dd8faf1b8f2b183 ]

A lot of drivers were getting platform and of headers
indirectly via headers like asm/pci.h or asm/prom.h

Most of them were fixed during 5.19 cycle but a newissue was
introduced by commit 52b1b46c39ae ("of: Create platform devices
for OF framebuffers")

Include missing platform_device.h to allow cleaning asm/pci.h

Fixes: 52b1b46c39ae ("of: Create platform devices for OF framebuffers")

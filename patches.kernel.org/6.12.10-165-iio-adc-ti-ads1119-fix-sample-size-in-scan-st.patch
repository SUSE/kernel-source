Subject: [PATCH] iio: adc: ti-ads1119: fix sample size in scan struct for
 triggered buffer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.10
Git-commit: 54d394905c92b9ecc65c1f9b2692c8e10716d8e1

commit 54d394905c92b9ecc65c1f9b2692c8e10716d8e1 upstream.

This device returns signed, 16-bit samples as stated in its datasheet
(see 8.5.2 Data Format). That is in line with the scan_type definition
for the IIO_VOLTAGE channel, but 'unsigned int' is being used to read
and push the data to userspace.

Given that the size of that type depends on the architecture (at least
2 bytes to store values up to 65535, but its actual size is often 4
bytes), use the 's16' type to provide the same structure in all cases.

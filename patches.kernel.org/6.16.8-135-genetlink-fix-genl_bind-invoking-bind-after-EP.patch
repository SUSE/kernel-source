Subject: [PATCH] genetlink: fix genl_bind() invoking bind() after -EPERM
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.8
Git-commit: 1dbfb0363224f6da56f6655d596dc5097308d6f5

[ Upstream commit 1dbfb0363224f6da56f6655d596dc5097308d6f5 ]

Per family bind/unbind callbacks were introduced to allow families
to track multicast group consumer presence, e.g. to start or stop
producing events depending on listeners.

However, in genl_bind() the bind() callback was invoked even if
capability checks failed and ret was set to -EPERM. This means that
callbacks could run on behalf of unauthorized callers while the
syscall still returned failure to user space.

Fix this by only invoking bind() after "if (ret) break;" check
i.e. after permission checks have succeeded.

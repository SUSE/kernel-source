Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2711-rpi-400: Fix delete-node of led_act
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.7
Git-commit: dc761f11af2e39119d3a7942e3d10615f3d900e7

[ Upstream commit dc761f11af2e39119d3a7942e3d10615f3d900e7 ]

The LED ACT which is included from bcm2711-rpi-4-b doesn't exists
on the Raspberry Pi 400. So the bcm2711-rpi-400.dts tries to
use the delete-node directive in order to remove the complete
node. Unfortunately the usage get broken in commit 1156e3a78bcc
("ARM: dts: bcm283x: Move ACT LED into separate dtsi")
and now ACT and PWR LED using the same GPIO and this prevent
probing of led-gpios on Raspberry Pi 400:

    leds-gpio: probe of leds failed with error -16

So fix the delete-node directive.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: acer-aspire1: Correct audio codec
 definition
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.14
Git-commit: feec9f0add432a867f23e29afcd2f7088889b8e2

[ Upstream commit feec9f0add432a867f23e29afcd2f7088889b8e2 ]

When initially added, a mistake was made in the definition of the codec.

Despite the fact that the DMIC line is connected on the side of the
codec chip, and relevant passive components, including 0-ohm resistors
connecting the dmics, are present, the dmic line is still cut in
another place on the board, which was overlooked.

Correct this by replacing the dmic configuration with a comment
describing this hardware detail.

While at it, also add missing regulators definitions. This is not a
functional change as all the relevant regulators were already added via
the other rail supplies.

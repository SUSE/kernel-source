Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: tegra210-adma: Update dependency to ARCH_TEGRA
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 33b7db45533af240fe44e809f9dc4d604cf82d07

[ Upstream commit 33b7db45533af240fe44e809f9dc4d604cf82d07 ]

Update the architecture dependency to be the generic Tegra
because the driver works on the four latest Tegra generations
not just T210, if you build a kernel with a specific
ARCH_TEGRA_xxx_SOC option that excludes 210 you don't get
this driver.

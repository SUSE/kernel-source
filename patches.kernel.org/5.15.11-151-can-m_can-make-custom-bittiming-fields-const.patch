Subject: [PATCH] can: m_can: make custom bittiming fields const
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.11
Git-commit: ea22ba40debee29ee7257c42002409899e9311c1

commit ea22ba40debee29ee7257c42002409899e9311c1 upstream.

The assigned timing structs will be defined a const anyway, so we can
avoid a few casts by declaring the struct fields as const as well.

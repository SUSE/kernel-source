Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: soc-card: Add storage for PCI SSID
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.3
Git-commit: 47f56e38a199bd45514b8e0142399cba4feeaf1a

[ Upstream commit 47f56e38a199bd45514b8e0142399cba4feeaf1a ]

Add members to struct snd_soc_card to store the PCI subsystem ID (SSID)
of the soundcard.

The PCI specification provides two registers to store a vendor-specific
SSID that can be read by drivers to uniquely identify a particular
"soundcard". This is defined in the PCI specification to distinguish
products that use the same silicon (and therefore have the same silicon
ID) so that product-specific differences can be applied.

PCI only defines 0xFFFF as an invalid value. 0x0000 is not defined as
invalid. So the usual pattern of zero-filling the struct and then
assuming a zero value unset will not work. A flag is included to
indicate when the SSID information has been filled in.

Unlike DMI information, which has a free-format entirely up to the vendor,
the PCI SSID has a strictly defined format and a registry of vendor IDs.

It is usual in Windows drivers that the SSID is used as the sole identifier
of the specific end-product and the Windows driver contains tables mapping
that to information about the hardware setup, rather than using ACPI
properties.

This SSID is important information for ASoC components that need to apply
hardware-specific configuration on PCI-based systems.

As the SSID is a generic part of the PCI specification and is treated as
identifying the "soundcard", it is reasonable to include this information
in struct snd_soc_card, instead of components inventing their own custom
ways to pass this information around.

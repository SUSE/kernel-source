commit a3f7c10a269d5b77dd5822ade822643ced3057f0 upstream.

Previously when we added a fence to a dma_resv object we always
assumed the the newer than all the existing fences.

With Jason's work to add an UAPI to explicit export/import that's not
necessary the case any more. So without this check we would allow
userspace to force the kernel into an use after free error.

Since the change is very small and defensive it's probably a good
idea to backport this to stable kernels as well just in case others
are using the dma_resv object in the same way.

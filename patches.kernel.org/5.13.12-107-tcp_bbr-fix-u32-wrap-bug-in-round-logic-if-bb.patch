Subject: [PATCH] tcp_bbr: fix u32 wrap bug in round logic if bbr_init() called
 after 2B packets
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.12
Git-commit: 6de035fec045f8ae5ee5f3a02373a18b939e91fb

[ Upstream commit 6de035fec045f8ae5ee5f3a02373a18b939e91fb ]

Currently if BBR congestion control is initialized after more than 2B
packets have been delivered, depending on the phase of the
tp->delivered counter the tracking of BBR round trips can get stuck.

The bug arises because if tp->delivered is between 2^31 and 2^32 at
the time the BBR congestion control module is initialized, then the
initialization of bbr->next_rtt_delivered to 0 will cause the logic to
believe that the end of the round trip is still billions of packets in
the future. More specifically, the following check will fail
repeatedly:

  !before(rs->prior_delivered, bbr->next_rtt_delivered)

and thus the connection will take up to 2B packets delivered before
that check will pass and the connection will set:

  bbr->round_start = 1;

This could cause many mechanisms in BBR to fail to trigger, for
example bbr_check_full_bw_reached() would likely never exit STARTUP.

This bug is 5 years old and has not been observed, and as a practical
matter this would likely rarely trigger, since it would require
transferring at least 2B packets, or likely more than 3 terabytes of
data, before switching congestion control algorithms to BBR.

This patch is a stable candidate for kernels as far back as v4.9,
when tcp_bbr.c was added.

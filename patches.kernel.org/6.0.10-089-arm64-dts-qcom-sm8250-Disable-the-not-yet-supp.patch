Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: Disable the not yet supported
 cluster idle state
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: cadaa773bcf161184fa428180516bae33a7bc667

[ Upstream commit cadaa773bcf161184fa428180516bae33a7bc667 ]

To support the deeper cluster idle state for sm8250 platforms, some
additional synchronization is needed between the rpmh-rsc device and the
CPU cluster PM domain. Until that is supported, let's disable the cluster
idle state.

This fixes a problem that has been reported for the Qcom RB5 platform (see
below), but most likely other sm8250 platforms suffers from similar issues,
so let's make the fix generic for sm8250.

vreg_l11c_3p3: failed to enable: -ETIMEDOUT
qcom-rpmh-regulator 18200000.rsc:pm8150l-rpmh-regulators: ldo11: devm_regulator_register() failed, ret=-110
qcom-rpmh-regulator: probe of 18200000.rsc:pm8150l-rpmh-regulators failed with error -110

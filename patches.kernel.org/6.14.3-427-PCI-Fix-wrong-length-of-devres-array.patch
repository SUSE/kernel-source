commit f09d3937d400433080d17982bd1a540da53a156d upstream.

The array for the iomapping cookie addresses has a length of
PCI_STD_NUM_BARS. This constant, however, only describes standard BARs;
while PCI can allow for additional, special BARs.

The total number of PCI resources is described by constant
PCI_NUM_RESOURCES, which is also used in, e.g., pci_select_bars().

Thus, the devres array has so far been too small.

Change the length of the devres array to PCI_NUM_RESOURCES.

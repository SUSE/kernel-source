Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: msm8974: correct qfprom node size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 724c4bf0e4bf81dba77736afb93964c986c3c123

[ Upstream commit 724c4bf0e4bf81dba77736afb93964c986c3c123 ]

The qfprom actually is bigger than 0x1000, so adjust the reg.

Note that the non-ECC-corrected qfprom can be found at 0xfc4b8000
(-0x4000). The current reg points to the ECC-corrected qfprom block
which should have equivalent values at all offsets compared to the
non-corrected version.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Disable HS400 for eMMC on ROCK 4C+
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.47
Git-commit: 2bd1d2dd808c60532283e9cf05110bf1bf2f9079

[ Upstream commit 2bd1d2dd808c60532283e9cf05110bf1bf2f9079 ]

There is some instablity with some eMMC modules on ROCK Pi 4 SBCs running
in HS400 mode. This ends up resulting in some block errors after a while
or after a "heavy" operation utilising the eMMC (e.g. resizing a
filesystem). An example of these errors is as follows:

    [  289.171014] mmc1: running CQE recovery
    [  290.048972] mmc1: running CQE recovery
    [  290.054834] mmc1: running CQE recovery
    [  290.060817] mmc1: running CQE recovery
    [  290.061337] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk1, sector 1411072 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 36 prio class 0
    [  290.061370] EXT4-fs warning (device mmcblk1p1): ext4_end_bio:348: I/O error 10 writing to inode 29547 starting block 176466)
    [  290.061484] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172288
    [  290.061531] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172289
    [  290.061551] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172290
    [  290.061574] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172291
    [  290.061592] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172292
    [  290.061615] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172293
    [  290.061632] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172294
    [  290.061654] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172295
    [  290.061673] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172296
    [  290.061695] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk1p1, logical block 172297

Disabling the Command Queue seems to stop the CQE recovery from running,
but doesn't seem to improve the I/O errors. Until this can be investigated
further, disable HS400 mode on the ROCK Pi 4 SBCs to at least stop I/O
errors from occurring.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor: mark bluetooth address as
 broken
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.5
Git-commit: e12e28009e584c8f8363439f6a928ec86278a106

commit e12e28009e584c8f8363439f6a928ec86278a106 upstream.

Several Qualcomm Bluetooth controllers lack persistent storage for the
device address and instead one can be provided by the boot firmware
using the 'local-bd-address' devicetree property.

The Bluetooth bindings clearly states that the address should be
specified in little-endian order, but due to a long-standing bug in the
Qualcomm driver which reversed the address some boot firmware has been
providing the address in big-endian order instead.

The boot firmware in SC7180 Trogdor Chromebooks is known to be affected
so mark the 'local-bd-address' property as broken to maintain backwards
compatibility with older firmware when fixing the underlying driver bug.

Note that ChromeOS always updates the kernel and devicetree in lockstep
so that there is no need to handle backwards compatibility with older
devicetrees.

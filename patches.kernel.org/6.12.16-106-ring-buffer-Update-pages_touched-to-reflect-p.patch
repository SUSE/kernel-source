Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Update pages_touched to reflect persistent
 buffer content
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.16
Git-commit: 97937834ae876f29565415ab15f1284666dc6be3

commit 97937834ae876f29565415ab15f1284666dc6be3 upstream.

The pages_touched field represents the number of subbuffers in the ring
buffer that have content that can be read. This is used in accounting of
"dirty_pages" and "buffer_percent" to allow the user to wait for the
buffer to be filled to a certain amount before it reads the buffer in
blocking mode.

The persistent buffer never updated this value so it was set to zero, and
this accounting would take it as it had no content. This would cause user
space to wait for content even though there's enough content in the ring
buffer that satisfies the buffer_percent.

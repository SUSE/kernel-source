Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: amlogic: meson-g12b-radxa-zero2: fix pwm clock
 names
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.2
Git-commit: db217e84d0a3f4183ea5b6d5929e55b73128fcb2

[ Upstream commit db217e84d0a3f4183ea5b6d5929e55b73128fcb2 ]

Fixes the following bindings check error:
 - pwm@2000: clock-names: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
	['clkin4'] is too short
	'clkin4' is not one of ['clkin0', 'clkin1']
	'clkin0' was expected
 - pwm@7000: clock-names: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
	['clkin3'] is too short
	'clkin3' is not one of ['clkin0', 'clkin1']
	'clkin0' was expected
 - pwm@19000: clock-names: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
	['clkin2'] is too short
	'clkin2' is not one of ['clkin0', 'clkin1']
	'clkin0' was expected

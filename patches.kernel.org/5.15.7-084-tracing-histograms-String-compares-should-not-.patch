Subject: [PATCH] tracing/histograms: String compares should not care about
 signed values
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.7
Git-commit: 450fec13d9170127678f991698ac1a5b05c02e2f

commit 450fec13d9170127678f991698ac1a5b05c02e2f upstream.

When comparing two strings for the "onmatch" histogram trigger, fields
that are strings use string comparisons, which do not care about being
signed or not.

Do not fail to match two string fields if one is unsigned char array and
the other is a signed char array.

Subject: [PATCH] net: qrtr: ns: Return 0 if server port is not present
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.13
Git-commit: 9bf2e9165f90dc9f416af53c902be7e33930f728

[ Upstream commit 9bf2e9165f90dc9f416af53c902be7e33930f728 ]

When a 'DEL_CLIENT' message is received from the remote, the corresponding
server port gets deleted. A DEL_SERVER message is then announced for this
server. As part of handling the subsequent DEL_SERVER message, the name-
server attempts to delete the server port which results in a '-ENOENT' error.
The return value from server_del() is then propagated back to qrtr_ns_worker,
causing excessive error prints.
To address this, return 0 from control_cmd_del_server() without checking the
return value of server_del(), since the above scenario is not an error case
and hence server_del() doesn't have any other error return value.

Subject: [PATCH] s390/kprobes: fix current_kprobe never cleared after kprobes
 reenter
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: cd57953936f2213dfaccce10d20f396956222c7d

commit cd57953936f2213dfaccce10d20f396956222c7d upstream.

Recent test_kprobe_missed kprobes kunit test uncovers the following
problem. Once kprobe is triggered from another kprobe (kprobe reenter),
all future kprobes on this cpu are considered as kprobe reenter, thus
pre_handler and post_handler are not being called and kprobes are counted
as "missed".

Commit b9599798f953 ("[S390] kprobes: activation and deactivation")
introduced a simpler scheme for kprobes (de)activation and status
tracking by using push_kprobe/pop_kprobe, which supposed to work for
both initial kprobe entry as well as kprobe reentry and helps to avoid
handling those two cases differently. The problem is that a sequence of
calls in case of kprobes reenter:
push_kprobe() <- NULL (current_kprobe)
push_kprobe() <- kprobe1 (current_kprobe)
pop_kprobe() -> kprobe1 (current_kprobe)
pop_kprobe() -> kprobe1 (current_kprobe)
leaves "kprobe1" as "current_kprobe" on this cpu, instead of setting it
to NULL. In fact push_kprobe/pop_kprobe can only store a single state
(there is just one prev_kprobe in kprobe_ctlblk). Which is a hack but
sufficient, there is no need to have another prev_kprobe just to store
NULL. To make a simple and backportable fix simply reset "prev_kprobe"
when kprobe is poped from this "stack". No need to worry about
"kprobe_status" in this case, because its value is only checked when
current_kprobe != NULL.

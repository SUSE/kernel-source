Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dpu1: Account for DSC's bits_per_pixel having 4
 fractional bits
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: d3c1a8663d0ddb74eaa51121ccbb8340739a12a8

[ Upstream commit d3c1a8663d0ddb74eaa51121ccbb8340739a12a8 ]

According to the comment this DPU register contains the bits per pixel
as a 6.4 fractional value, conveniently matching the contents of
bits_per_pixel in struct drm_dsc_config which also uses 4 fractional
bits.  However, the downstream source this implementation was
copy-pasted from has its bpp field stored _without_ fractional part.

This makes the entire convoluted math obsolete as it is impossible to
pull those 4 fractional bits out of thin air, by somehow trying to reuse
the lowest 2 bits of a non-fractional bpp (lsb = bpp % 4??).

The rest of the code merely attempts to keep the integer part a multiple
of 4, which is rendered useless thanks to data |= dsc->bits_per_pixel <<
12; already filling up those bits anyway (but not on downstream).

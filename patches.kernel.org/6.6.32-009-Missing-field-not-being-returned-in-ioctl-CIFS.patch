Subject: [PATCH] Missing field not being returned in ioctl
 CIFS_IOC_GET_MNT_INFO
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.32
Git-commit: 784e0e20b4c97c270b2892f677d3fad658e2c1d5

[ Upstream commit 784e0e20b4c97c270b2892f677d3fad658e2c1d5 ]

The tcon_flags field was always being set to zero in the information
about the mount returned by the ioctl CIFS_IOC_GET_MNT_INFO instead
of being set to the value of the Flags field in the tree connection
structure as intended.

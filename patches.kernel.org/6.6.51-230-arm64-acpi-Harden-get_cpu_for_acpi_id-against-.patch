Subject: [PATCH] arm64: acpi: Harden get_cpu_for_acpi_id() against missing CPU
 entry
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.51
Git-commit: 2488444274c70038eb6b686cba5f1ce48ebb9cdd

[ Upstream commit 2488444274c70038eb6b686cba5f1ce48ebb9cdd ]

In a review discussion of the changes to support vCPU hotplug where
a check was added on the GICC being enabled if was online, it was
noted that there is need to map back to the cpu and use that to index
into a cpumask. As such, a valid ID is needed.

If an MPIDR check fails in acpi_map_gic_cpu_interface() it is possible
for the entry in cpu_madt_gicc[cpu] == NULL.  This function would
then cause a NULL pointer dereference.   Whilst a path to trigger
this has not been established, harden this caller against the
possibility.

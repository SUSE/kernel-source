Subject: [PATCH] wifi: mt76: mt7996: fix mt7996_mcu_all_sta_info_event struct
 packing
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.2
Git-commit: 2ee1c40daeb9a33e25c460bf87feca58e91af879

[ Upstream commit 2ee1c40daeb9a33e25c460bf87feca58e91af879 ]

The internal struct and union inside mt7996_mcu_all_sta_info_event is
marked as being aligned, which conflicts with it being unaligned
within that structure:

drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7996/mcu.h:165:2: error: field  within 'struct mt7996_mcu_all_sta_info_event' is less aligned than 'union mt7996_mcu_all_sta_info_event::(anonymous at ../drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7996/mcu.h:165:2)' and is usually due to 'struct mt7996_mcu_all_sta_info_event' being packed, which can lead to unaligned accesses [-Werror,-Wunaligned-access]

Mark all three as being packed as well to ensure byte packing for
the entire thing.

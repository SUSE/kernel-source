Subject: [PATCH] afs: Fix vlserver probe RTT handling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.9
Git-commit: ba00b190670809c1a89326d80de96d714f6004f2

[ Upstream commit ba00b190670809c1a89326d80de96d714f6004f2 ]

In the same spirit as commit ca57f02295f1 ("afs: Fix fileserver probe
RTT handling"), don't rule out using a vlserver just because there
haven't been enough packets yet to calculate a real rtt.  Always set the
server's probe rtt from the estimate provided by rxrpc_kernel_get_srtt,
which is capped at 1 second.

This could lead to EDESTADDRREQ errors when accessing a cell for the
first time, even though the vl servers are known and have responded to a
probe.

Subject: [PATCH] regmap: maple: work around gcc-14.1 false-positive warning
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.51
Git-commit: 542440fd7b30983cae23e32bd22f69a076ec7ef4

[ Upstream commit 542440fd7b30983cae23e32bd22f69a076ec7ef4 ]

With gcc-14.1, there is a false-postive -Wuninitialized warning in
regcache_maple_drop:

drivers/base/regmap/regcache-maple.c: In function 'regcache_maple_drop':
drivers/base/regmap/regcache-maple.c:113:23: error: 'lower_index' is used uninitialized [-Werror=uninitialized]
  113 |         unsigned long lower_index, lower_last;
      |                       ^~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/base/regmap/regcache-maple.c:113:36: error: 'lower_last' is used uninitialized [-Werror=uninitialized]
  113 |         unsigned long lower_index, lower_last;
      |                                    ^~~~~~~~~~

I've created a reduced test case to see if this needs to be reported
as a gcc, but it appears that the gcc-14.x branch already has a change
that turns this into a more sensible -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning, so
I ended up not reporting it so far.

The reduced test case also produces a warning for gcc-13 and gcc-12
but I don't see that with the version in the kernel.

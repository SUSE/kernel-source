Subject: [PATCH] nfs: Make NFS_FSCACHE select NETFS_SUPPORT instead of
 depending on it
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.14
Git-commit: 90190ba1c3b11687e2c251fda1f5d9893b4bab17

commit 90190ba1c3b11687e2c251fda1f5d9893b4bab17 upstream.

Having the NFS_FSCACHE option depend on the NETFS_SUPPORT options makes
selecting NFS_FSCACHE impossible unless another option that additionally
selects NETFS_SUPPORT is already selected.

As a result, for example, being able to reach and select the NFS_FSCACHE
option requires the CEPH_FS or CIFS option to be selected beforehand, which
obviously doesn't make much sense.

Let's correct this by making the NFS_FSCACHE option actually select the
NETFS_SUPPORT option, instead of depending on it.

Fixes: 915cd30cdea8 ("netfs, fscache: Combine fscache with netfs")

Subject: [PATCH] qed/qed_dev: guard against a possible division by zero
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.8
Git-commit: 1a9dc5610ef89d807acdcfbff93a558f341a44da

[ Upstream commit 1a9dc5610ef89d807acdcfbff93a558f341a44da ]

Previously we would divide total_left_rate by zero if num_vports
happened to be 1 because non_requested_count is calculated as
num_vports - req_count. Guard against this by validating num_vports at
the beginning and returning an error otherwise.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE
static analysis tool.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: output the reason for open_ctree() failure
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: d0f038104fa37380e2a725e669508e43d0c503e9

commit d0f038104fa37380e2a725e669508e43d0c503e9 upstream.

There is a recent ML report that mounting a large fs backed by hardware
RAID56 controller (with one device missing) took too much time, and
systemd seems to kill the mount attempt.

In that case, the only error message is:

  BTRFS error (device sdj): open_ctree failed

There is no reason on why the failure happened, making it very hard to
understand the reason.

At least output the error number (in the particular case it should be
-EINTR) to provide some clue.

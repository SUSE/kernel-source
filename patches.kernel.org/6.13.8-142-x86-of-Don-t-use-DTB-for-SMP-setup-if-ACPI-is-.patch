Subject: [PATCH] x86/of: Don't use DTB for SMP setup if ACPI is enabled
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.8
Git-commit: 96f41f644c4885761b0d117fc36dc5dcf92e15ec

[ Upstream commit 96f41f644c4885761b0d117fc36dc5dcf92e15ec ]

There are cases when it is useful to use both ACPI and DTB provided by
the bootloader, however in such cases we should make sure to prevent
conflicts between the two. Namely, don't try to use DTB for SMP setup
if ACPI is enabled.

Precisely, this prevents at least:

- incorrectly calling register_lapic_address(APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE)
  after the LAPIC was already successfully enumerated via ACPI, causing
  noisy kernel warnings and probably potential real issues as well

- failed IOAPIC setup in the case when IOAPIC is enumerated via mptable
  instead of ACPI (e.g. with acpi=noirq), due to
  mpparse_parse_smp_config() overridden by x86_dtb_parse_smp_config()

Subject: [PATCH] um: Use asm-generic/dma-mapping.h
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 365719035526e8eda214a1cedb2e1c96e969a0d7

commit 365719035526e8eda214a1cedb2e1c96e969a0d7 upstream.

If DMA (PCI over virtio) is enabled, then some drivers may
enable CONFIG_DMA_OPS as well, and then we pull in the x86
definition of get_arch_dma_ops(), which uses the dma_ops
symbol, which isn't defined.

Since we don't have real DMA ops nor any kind of IOMMU fix
this in the simplest possible way: pull in the asm-generic
file instead of inheriting the x86 one. It's not clear why
those drivers that do (e.g. VDPA) "select DMA_OPS", and if
they'd even work with this, but chances are nobody will be
wanting to do that anyway, so fixing the build failure is
good enough.

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: make error messages more clear when getting a chunk
 map
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.66
Git-commit: 7d410d5efe04e42a6cd959bfe6d59d559fdf8b25

commit 7d410d5efe04e42a6cd959bfe6d59d559fdf8b25 upstream.

When getting a chunk map, at btrfs_get_chunk_map(), we do some sanity
checks to verify we found a chunk map and that map found covers the
logical address the caller passed in. However the messages aren't very
clear in the sense that don't mention the issue is with a chunk map and
one of them prints the 'length' argument as if it were the end offset of
the requested range (while the in the string format we use %llu-%llu
which suggests a range, and the second %llu-%llu is actually a range for
the chunk map). So improve these two details in the error messages.

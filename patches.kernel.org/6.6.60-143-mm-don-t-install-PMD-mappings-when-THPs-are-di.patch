Subject: [PATCH] mm: don't install PMD mappings when THPs are disabled by the
 hw/process/vma
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.60
Git-commit: 2b0f922323ccfa76219bcaacd35cd50aeaa13592

commit 2b0f922323ccfa76219bcaacd35cd50aeaa13592 upstream.

We (or rather, readahead logic :) ) might be allocating a THP in the
pagecache and then try mapping it into a process that explicitly disabled
THP: we might end up installing PMD mappings.

This is a problem for s390x KVM, which explicitly remaps all PMD-mapped
THPs to be PTE-mapped in s390_enable_sie()->thp_split_mm(), before
starting the VM.

For example, starting a VM backed on a file system with large folios
supported makes the VM crash when the VM tries accessing such a mapping
using KVM.

Is it also a problem when the HW disabled THP using
TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_UNSUPPORTED?  At least on x86 this would be the case
without X86_FEATURE_PSE.

In the future, we might be able to do better on s390x and only disallow
PMD mappings -- what s390x and likely TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_UNSUPPORTED
really wants.  For now, fix it by essentially performing the same check as
would be done in __thp_vma_allowable_orders() or in shmem code, where this
works as expected, and disallow PMD mappings, making us fallback to PTE
mappings.

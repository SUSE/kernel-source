Subject: [PATCH] media: i2c: imx219: fix msr access command sequence
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.44

[ Upstream commit 3cdc776e0a5f1784c3ae5d3371b64215c228bf1f ]

It was reported to me that the imx219 didn't work on one of our
development kits partly because the access sequence is incorrect.
The datasheet I could find [1] for this camera has the access sequence:
Seq. No. Address (Hex) data
1        30EB          05
2        30EB          0C
3        300A          FF
4        300B          FF
5        30EB          05
6        30EB          09

but the driver swaps the first two elements. Laurent pointed out on IRC
that the original code used the correct sequence for 1920x1080 but the
current sequence for 3280x2464 and 1640x1232. During refactoring of the
init sequence the current order was used for all formats.

Switch to using the documented sequence.

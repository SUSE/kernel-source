Subject: [PATCH] ksmbd: smbd: fix connection dropped issue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.4
Git-commit: 5366afc4065075a4456941fbd51c33604d631ee5

[ Upstream commit 5366afc4065075a4456941fbd51c33604d631ee5 ]

When there are bursty connection requests,
RDMA connection event handler is deferred and
Negotiation requests are received even if
connection status is NEW.

To handle it, set the status to CONNECTED
if Negotiation requests are received.

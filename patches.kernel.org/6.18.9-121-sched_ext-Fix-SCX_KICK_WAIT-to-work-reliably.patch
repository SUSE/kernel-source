Subject: [PATCH] sched_ext: Fix SCX_KICK_WAIT to work reliably
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.18.9
Git-commit: a379fa1e2cae15d7422b4eead83a6366f2f445cb

commit a379fa1e2cae15d7422b4eead83a6366f2f445cb upstream.

SCX_KICK_WAIT is used to synchronously wait for the target CPU to complete
a reschedule and can be used to implement operations like core scheduling.

This used to be implemented by scx_next_task_picked() incrementing pnt_seq,
which was always called when a CPU picks the next task to run, allowing
SCX_KICK_WAIT to reliably wait for the target CPU to enter the scheduler and
pick the next task.

However, commit b999e365c298 ("sched_ext: Replace scx_next_task_picked()
with switch_class()") replaced scx_next_task_picked() with the
switch_class() callback, which is only called when switching between sched
classes. This broke SCX_KICK_WAIT because pnt_seq would no longer be
reliably incremented unless the previous task was SCX and the next task was
not.

This fix leverages commit 4c95380701f5 ("sched/ext: Fold balance_scx() into
pick_task_scx()") which refactored the pick path making put_prev_task_scx()
the natural place to track task switches for SCX_KICK_WAIT. The fix moves
pnt_seq increment to put_prev_task_scx() and also increments it in
pick_task_scx() to handle cases where the same task is re-selected, whether
by BPF scheduler decision or slice refill. The semantics: If the current
task on the target CPU is SCX, SCX_KICK_WAIT waits until the CPU enters the
scheduling path. This provides sufficient guarantee for use cases like core
scheduling while keeping the operation self-contained within SCX.

v2: - Also increment pnt_seq in pick_task_scx() to handle same-task
      re-selection (Andrea Righi).
    - Use smp_cond_load_acquire() for the busy-wait loop for better
      architecture optimization (Peter Zijlstra).

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "usb: typec: tcpm: reset counter when enter into
 unattached state after try role"
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: 23b1d2d99b0f55326f05e7d757fa197c4a95dc5c

commit 23b1d2d99b0f55326f05e7d757fa197c4a95dc5c upstream.

The reverted commit makes the state machine only ever go from SRC_ATTACH_WAIT
to SNK_TRY in endless loop when toggling. After revert it goes to SRC_ATTACHED
after initially trying SNK_TRY earlier, as it should for toggling to ever detect
the power source mode and the port is again able to provide power to attached
power sinks.

This reverts commit 2d6d80127006ae3da26b1f21a65eccf957f2d1e5.

Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/gic-v3: Ensure pseudo-NMIs have an ISB between ack
 and handling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: adf14453d2c037ab529040c1186ea32e277e783a

[ Upstream commit adf14453d2c037ab529040c1186ea32e277e783a ]

There are cases where a context synchronization event is necessary
between an IRQ being raised and being handled, and there are races such
that we cannot rely upon the exception entry being subsequent to the
interrupt being raised.

We identified and fixes this for regular IRQs in commit:

  39a06b67c2c1256b ("irqchip/gic: Ensure we have an ISB between ack and ->handle_irq")

Unfortunately, we forgot to do the same for psuedo-NMIs when support for
those was added in commit:

  f32c926651dcd168 ("irqchip/gic-v3: Handle pseudo-NMIs")

Which means that when pseudo-NMIs are used for PMU support, we'll hit
the same problem.

Apply the same fix as for regular IRQs. Note that when EOI mode 1 is in
use, the call to gic_write_eoir() will provide an ISB.

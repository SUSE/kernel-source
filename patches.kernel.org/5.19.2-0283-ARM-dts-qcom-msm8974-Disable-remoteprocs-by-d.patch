Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: msm8974: Disable remoteprocs by default
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 8d8be8dd7c1f5d50f84ecc7a6a41962da48c6164

[ Upstream commit 8d8be8dd7c1f5d50f84ecc7a6a41962da48c6164 ]

The remoteproc configuration in qcom-msm8974.dtsi is incomplete because
it lacks the regulator supplies that should be added in the board DT
files. Some of the msm8974 boards are currently missing the regulator
supplies and should have the remoteprocs disabled to avoid making use
of the incomplete configuration.

This also fixes dtbs_check warnings after moving "qcom,msm8974-mss-pil"
to DT schema, which rightfully complains that the -supply properties
are missing for some boards:

qcom-apq8074-dragonboard.dtb:
remoteproc@fc880000: 'pll-supply' is a required property
        From schema: remoteproc/qcom,msm8916-mss-pil.yaml
remoteproc@fc880000: 'mss-supply' is a required property
        From schema: remoteproc/qcom,msm8916-mss-pil.yaml
remoteproc@fc880000: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
        'power-domains' is a required property
        'power-domain-names' is a required property, or
        'cx-supply' is a required property
        'mx-supply' is a required property

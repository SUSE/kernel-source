Subject: [PATCH] tools: Override makefile ARCH variable if defined, but empty

[ Upstream commit 537a2525eaf76ea9b0dca62b994500d8670b39d5 ]

There are a number of tools (bpftool, selftests), that require a
"bootstrap" build. Here, a bootstrap build is a build host variant of
a target. E.g., assume that you're performing a bpftool cross-build on
x86 to riscv, a bootstrap build would then be an x86 variant of
bpftool. The typical way to perform the host build variant, is to pass
"ARCH=" in a sub-make. However, if a variable has been set with a
command argument, then ordinary assignments in the makefile are
ignored.

This side-effect results in that ARCH, and variables depending on ARCH
are not set. Workaround by overriding ARCH to the host arch, if ARCH
is empty.

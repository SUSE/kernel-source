Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: trogdor: Add no-hpd to DSI bridge node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: 5f551b5ce55575b14c26933fe9b49365ea246b3d

[ Upstream commit 5f551b5ce55575b14c26933fe9b49365ea246b3d ]

We should indicate that we're not using the HPD pin on this device, per
the binding document. Otherwise if code in the future wants to enable
HPD in the bridge when this property is absent we'll be wasting power
powering hpd when we don't use it on trogdor boards. We didn't notice
this before because the kernel driver blindly disables hpd, but that
won't be true for much longer.

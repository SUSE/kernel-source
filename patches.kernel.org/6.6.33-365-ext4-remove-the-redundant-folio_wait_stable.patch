Subject: [PATCH] ext4: remove the redundant folio_wait_stable()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.33
Git-commit: df0b5afc62f3368d657a8fe4a8d393ac481474c2

[ Upstream commit df0b5afc62f3368d657a8fe4a8d393ac481474c2 ]

__filemap_get_folio() with FGP_WRITEBEGIN parameter has already wait
for stable folio, so remove the redundant folio_wait_stable() in
ext4_da_write_begin(), it was left over from the commit cc883236b792
("ext4: drop unnecessary journal handle in delalloc write") that
removed the retry getting page logic.

Fixes: cc883236b792 ("ext4: drop unnecessary journal handle in delalloc write")

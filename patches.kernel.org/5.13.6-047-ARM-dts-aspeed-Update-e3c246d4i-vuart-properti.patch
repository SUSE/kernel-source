Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed: Update e3c246d4i vuart properties
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.6
Git-commit: 812bae32e5d50914f75a6e036d3bde39ca86b0c3

[ Upstream commit 812bae32e5d50914f75a6e036d3bde39ca86b0c3 ]

This device-tree was merged with a provisional vuart IRQ-polarity
property that was still under review and ended up taking a somewhat
different form.  This patch updates it to match the final form of the
new vuart properties, which additionally allow specifying the SIRQ
number and LPC address.

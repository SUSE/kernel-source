Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: Fix IPCC EXTI declaration on stm32mp151
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: 4ea654242e0c75bdf6b45d3c619c5fdcb2e9312a

[ Upstream commit 4ea654242e0c75bdf6b45d3c619c5fdcb2e9312a ]

The GIC IRQ type used for IPCC RX should be IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.
Replacing the interrupt with the EXTI event changes the type to
the numeric value 1, meaning IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING.

The issue is that EXTI event 61 is a direct event.The IRQ type of
direct events is not used by EXTI and is propagated to the parent
IRQ controller of EXTI, the GIC.

Align the IRQ type to the value expected by the GIC by replacing
the second parameter "1" with IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

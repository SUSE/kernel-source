Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rockchip: Fix the timer clocks order
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.5
Git-commit: 7b46d674ac000b101fdad92cf16cc11d90b72f86

[ Upstream commit 7b46d674ac000b101fdad92cf16cc11d90b72f86 ]

Fixed order is the device-tree convention.
The timer driver currently gets clocks by name,
so no changes are needed there.

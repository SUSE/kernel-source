Subject: [PATCH] netlink: specs: rt-link: adjust mctp attribute naming
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.4
Git-commit: beb3c5ad8829b52057f48a776a9d9558b98c157f

[ Upstream commit beb3c5ad8829b52057f48a776a9d9558b98c157f ]

MCTP attribute naming is inconsistent. In C we have:
    IFLA_MCTP_NET,
    IFLA_MCTP_PHYS_BINDING,
         ^^^^

but in YAML:
    - mctp-net
    - phys-binding
      ^
       no "mctp"

It's unclear whether the "mctp" part of the name is supposed
to be a prefix or part of attribute name. Make it a prefix,
seems cleaner, even tho technically phys-binding was added later.

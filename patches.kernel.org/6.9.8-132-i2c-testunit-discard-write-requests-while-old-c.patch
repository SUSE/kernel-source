Subject: [PATCH] i2c: testunit: discard write requests while old command is
 running
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.8
Git-commit: c116deafd1a5cc1e9739099eb32114e90623209c

[ Upstream commit c116deafd1a5cc1e9739099eb32114e90623209c ]

When clearing registers on new write requests was added, the protection
for currently running commands was missed leading to concurrent access
to the testunit registers. Check the flag beforehand.

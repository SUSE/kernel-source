Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: meson8b: correct uart_B and uart_C clock references
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.4
Git-commit: d542ce8d4769cdef6a7bc3437e59cfed9c68f0e4

[ Upstream commit d542ce8d4769cdef6a7bc3437e59cfed9c68f0e4 ]

With the current device tree for meson8b, uarts B (e.g. available on pins
8/10 on Odroid-C1) and C (pins 3/5 on Odroid-C1) do not work, because they
are relying on incorrect clocks. Change the references of pclk to the
correct CLKID, to allow use of the two uarts.

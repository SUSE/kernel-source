Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for Legion Y9000X 2019
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.16.11
Git-commit: c07f2c7b45413a9e50ba78630fda04ecfa17b4f2

commit c07f2c7b45413a9e50ba78630fda04ecfa17b4f2 upstream.

Legion Y9000X 2019 has the same speaker with Y9000X 2020,
but with a different quirk address. Add one quirk entry
to make the speaker work on Y9000X 2019 too.

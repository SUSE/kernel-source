Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Add missing power-domains for rk356x
 vop_mmu
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 9d42c3ee3ce37cdad6f98c9e77bfbd0d791ac7da

[ Upstream commit 9d42c3ee3ce37cdad6f98c9e77bfbd0d791ac7da ]

The iommu@fe043e00 on RK356x SoC shares the VOP power domain, but the
power-domains property was not provided when the node has been added.

The consequence is that an attempt to reload the rockchipdrm module will
freeze the entire system.  That is because on probe time,
pm_runtime_get_suppliers() gets called for vop@fe040000, which blocks
when pm_runtime_get_sync() is being invoked for iommu@fe043e00.

Fix the issue by adding the missing property.

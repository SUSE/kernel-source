Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: msm: dsi-controller-main: Fix power-domain
 constraint
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.7
Git-commit: a6f033938beb31f893302a93f83ec0b6460c6cac

commit a6f033938beb31f893302a93f83ec0b6460c6cac upstream.

power-domain is required for the sc7180 dispcc GDSC but not every qcom SoC
has a similar dependency for example the apq8064.

Most Qcom SoC's using mdss-dsi-ctrl seem to have the ability to
power-collapse the MDP without collapsing DSI.

For example the qcom vendor kernel commit for apq8084, msm8226, msm8916,
msm8974.

"ARM: dts: msm: add mdss gdsc supply to dsi controller device

 It is possible for the DSI controller to be active when MDP is
 power collapsed. DSI controller needs to have it's own vote for
 mdss gdsc to ensure that gdsc remains on in such cases."

This however doesn't appear to be the case for the apq8064 so we shouldn't
be marking power-domain as required in yaml checks.

Subject: [PATCH] cxl/port: Fix cxl_bus_rescan() vs bus_rescan_devices()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.60
Git-commit: 3d6ebf16438de5d712030fefbb4182b46373d677

[ Upstream commit 3d6ebf16438de5d712030fefbb4182b46373d677 ]

It turns out since its original introduction, pre-2.6.12,
bus_rescan_devices() has skipped devices that might be in the process of
attaching or detaching from their driver. For CXL this behavior is
unwanted and expects that cxl_bus_rescan() is a probe barrier.

That behavior is simple enough to achieve with bus_for_each_dev() paired
with call to device_attach(), and it is unclear why bus_rescan_devices()
took the position of lockless consumption of dev->driver which is racy.

The "Fixes:" but no "Cc: stable" on this patch reflects that the issue
is merely by inspection since the bug that triggered the discovery of
this potential problem [1] is fixed by other means.  However, a stable
backport should do no harm.

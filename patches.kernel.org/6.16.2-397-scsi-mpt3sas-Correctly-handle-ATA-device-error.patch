Subject: [PATCH] scsi: mpt3sas: Correctly handle ATA device errors
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: 15592a11d5a5c8411ac8494ec49736b658f6fbff

[ Upstream commit 15592a11d5a5c8411ac8494ec49736b658f6fbff ]

With the ATA error model, an NCQ command failure always triggers an abort
(termination) of all NCQ commands queued on the device. In such case, the
SAT or the host must handle the failed command according to the command
sense data and immediately retry all other NCQ commands that were aborted
due to the failed NCQ command.

For SAS HBAs controlled by the mpt3sas driver, NCQ command aborts are not
handled by the HBA SAT and sent back to the host, with an ioc log
information equal to 0x31080000 (IOC_LOGINFO_PREFIX_PL with the PL code
PL_LOGINFO_CODE_SATA_NCQ_FAIL_ALL_CMDS_AFTR_ERR). The function
_scsih_io_done() always forces a retry of commands terminated with the
status MPI2_IOCSTATUS_SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED using the SCSI result
DID_SOFT_ERROR, regardless of the log_info for the command.  This
correctly forces the retry of collateral NCQ abort commands, but with the
retry counter for the command being incremented. If a command to an ATA
device is subject to too many retries due to other NCQ commands failing
(e.g. read commands trying to access unreadable sectors), the collateral
NCQ abort commands may be terminated with an error as they run out of
retries. This violates the SAT specification and causes hard-to-debug
command errors.

Solve this issue by modifying the handling of the
MPI2_IOCSTATUS_SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED status to check if a command is for an
ATA device and if the command loginfo indicates an NCQ collateral
abort. If that is the case, force the command retry using the SCSI result
DID_IMM_RETRY to avoid incrementing the command retry count.

Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: Don't unregister cpufreq cooling on CPU hotplug
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.27
Git-commit: c4d61a529db788d2e52654f5b02c8d1de4952c5b

[ Upstream commit c4d61a529db788d2e52654f5b02c8d1de4952c5b ]

Offlining a CPU and bringing it back online is a common operation and it
happens frequently during system suspend/resume, where the non-boot CPUs
are hotplugged out during suspend and brought back at resume.

The cpufreq core already tries to make this path as fast as possible as
the changes are only temporary in nature and full cleanup of resources
isn't required in this case. For example the drivers can implement
online()/offline() callbacks to avoid a lot of tear down of resources.

On similar lines, there is no need to unregister the cpufreq cooling
device during suspend / resume, but only while the policy is getting
removed.

Moreover, unregistering the cpufreq cooling device is resulting in an
unwanted outcome, where the system suspend is eventually aborted in the
process.  Currently, during system suspend the cpufreq core unregisters
the cooling device, which in turn removes a kobject using device_del()
and that generates a notification to the userspace via uevent broadcast.
This causes system suspend to abort in some setups.

This was also earlier reported (indirectly) by Roman [1]. Maybe there is
another way around to fixing that problem properly, but this change
makes sense anyways.

Move the registering and unregistering of the cooling device to policy
creation and removal times onlyy.

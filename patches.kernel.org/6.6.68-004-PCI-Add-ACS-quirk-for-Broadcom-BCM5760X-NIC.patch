[ Upstream commit 524e057b2d66b61f9b63b6db30467ab7b0bb4796 ]

The Broadcom BCM5760X NIC may be a multi-function device.

While it does not advertise an ACS capability, peer-to-peer transactions
are not possible between the individual functions. So it is ok to treat
them as fully isolated.

Add an ACS quirk for this device so the functions can be in independent
IOMMU groups and attached individually to userspace applications using
VFIO.

Subject: [PATCH] cifs: fix use after free for iface while disabling secondary
 channels
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.32
Git-commit: a15ccef82d3de9a37dc25898c60a394209368dc8

[ Upstream commit a15ccef82d3de9a37dc25898c60a394209368dc8 ]

We were deferencing iface after it has been released. Fix is to
release after all dereference instances have been encountered.

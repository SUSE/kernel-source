Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8992: Don't use sfpb mutex
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.9
Git-commit: 2bd5ab93335bf2c4d22c8db427822ae637ed8dc3

[ Upstream commit 2bd5ab93335bf2c4d22c8db427822ae637ed8dc3 ]

MSM8992 uses the same mutex hardware as MSM8994. This was wrong
from the start, but never presented as an issue until the sfpb
compatible was given different driver data.

Fixes: 6a6d1978f9c0 ("arm64: dts: msm8992 SoC and LG Bullhead (Nexus 5X) support")

Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: remove duplicated variables
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.58
Git-commit: 87cb3f6e0c047f9320889e68140f46b1f4ca9eca

A few week ago, there were some backport issues in MPTCP selftests,
because some patches have been applied twice, but with versions handling
conflicts differently [1].

Patches fixing these issues have been sent [2] and applied, but it looks
like quilt was still confused with the removal of some patches, and
commit a417ef47a665 ("selftests: mptcp: join: validate event numbers")
duplicated some variables, not present in the original patch [3].

Anyway, Bash was complaining, but that was not causing any tests to
fail. Also, that's easy to fix by simply removing the duplicated ones.

Subject: [PATCH] afs: Don't cross .backup mountpoint from backup volume
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.34
Git-commit: 29be9100aca2915fab54b5693309bc42956542e5

commit 29be9100aca2915fab54b5693309bc42956542e5 upstream.

Don't cross a mountpoint that explicitly specifies a backup volume
(target is <vol>.backup) when starting from a backup volume.

It it not uncommon to mount a volume's backup directly in the volume
itself.  This can cause tools that are not paying attention to get
into a loop mounting the volume onto itself as they attempt to
traverse the tree, leading to a variety of problems.

This doesn't prevent the general case of loops in a sequence of
mountpoints, but addresses a common special case in the same way
as other afs clients.

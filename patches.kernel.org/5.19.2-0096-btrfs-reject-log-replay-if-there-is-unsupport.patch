Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: reject log replay if there is unsupported RO compat
 flag
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: dc4d31684974d140250f3ee612c3f0cab13b3146

commit dc4d31684974d140250f3ee612c3f0cab13b3146 upstream.

[BUG]
If we have a btrfs image with dirty log, along with an unsupported RO
compatible flag:

log_root		30474240
...
compat_flags		0x0
compat_ro_flags		0x40000003
			( FREE_SPACE_TREE |
			  FREE_SPACE_TREE_VALID |
			  unknown flag: 0x40000000 )

Then even if we can only mount it RO, we will still cause metadata
update for log replay:

  BTRFS info (device dm-1): flagging fs with big metadata feature
  BTRFS info (device dm-1): using free space tree
  BTRFS info (device dm-1): has skinny extents
  BTRFS info (device dm-1): start tree-log replay

This is definitely against RO compact flag requirement.

[CAUSE]
RO compact flag only forces us to do RO mount, but we will still do log
replay for plain RO mount.

Thus this will result us to do log replay and update metadata.

This can be very problematic for new RO compat flag, for example older
kernel can not understand v2 cache, and if we allow metadata update on
RO mount and invalidate/corrupt v2 cache.

[FIX]
Just reject the mount unless rescue=nologreplay is provided:

  BTRFS error (device dm-1): cannot replay dirty log with unsupport optional features (0x40000000), try rescue=nologreplay instead

We don't want to set rescue=nologreply directly, as this would make the
end user to read the old data, and cause confusion.

Since the such case is really rare, we're mostly fine to just reject the
mount with an error message, which also includes the proper workaround.

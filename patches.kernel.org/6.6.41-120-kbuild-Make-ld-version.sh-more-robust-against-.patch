Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: Make ld-version.sh more robust against version string
 changes
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.41
Git-commit: 9852f47ac7c993990317570ff125e30ad901e213

[ Upstream commit 9852f47ac7c993990317570ff125e30ad901e213 ]

After [1] in upstream LLVM, ld.lld's version output became slightly
different when the cmake configuration option LLVM_APPEND_VC_REV is
disabled.

Before:

  Debian LLD 19.0.0 (compatible with GNU linkers)

After:

  Debian LLD 19.0.0, compatible with GNU linkers

This results in ld-version.sh failing with

  scripts/ld-version.sh: 18: arithmetic expression: expecting EOF: "10000 * 19 + 100 * 0 + 0,"

because the trailing comma is included in the patch level part of the
expression. While [1] has been partially reverted in [2] to avoid this
breakage (as it impacts the configuration stage and it is present in all
LTS branches), it would be good to make ld-version.sh more robust
against such miniscule changes like this one.

Use POSIX shell parameter expansion [3] to remove the largest suffix
after just numbers and periods, replacing of the current removal of
everything after a hyphen. ld-version.sh continues to work for a number
of distributions (Arch Linux, Debian, and Fedora) and the kernel.org
toolchains and no longer errors on a version of ld.lld with [1].

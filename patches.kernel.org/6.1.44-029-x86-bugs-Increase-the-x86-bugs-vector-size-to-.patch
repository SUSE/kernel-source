Subject: [PATCH] x86/bugs: Increase the x86 bugs vector size to two u32s
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.44
Git-commit: dfede4cb8ef732039b7a479d260bd89d3b474f14

Upstream commit: 0e52740ffd10c6c316837c6c128f460f1aaba1ea

There was never a doubt in my mind that they would not fit into a single
u32 eventually.

Subject: [PATCH] mm/shmem: use page_mapping() to detect page cache for uffd
 continue
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.9
Git-commit: 93b0d9178743a68723babe8448981f658aebc58e

commit 93b0d9178743a68723babe8448981f658aebc58e upstream.

mfill_atomic_install_pte() checks page->mapping to detect whether one page
is used in the page cache.  However as pointed out by Matthew, the page
can logically be a tail page rather than always the head in the case of
uffd minor mode with UFFDIO_CONTINUE.  It means we could wrongly install
one pte with shmem thp tail page assuming it's an anonymous page.

It's not that clear even for anonymous page, since normally anonymous
pages also have page->mapping being setup with the anon vma.  It's safe
here only because the only such caller to mfill_atomic_install_pte() is
always passing in a newly allocated page (mcopy_atomic_pte()), whose
page->mapping is not yet setup.  However that's not extremely obvious
either.

For either of above, use page_mapping() instead.

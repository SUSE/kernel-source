Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: SOF: topology: Fix logic for copying tuples

[ Upstream commit 41c5305cc3d827d2ea686533777a285176ae01a0 ]

Topology could have more instances of the tokens being searched for than
the number of sets that need to be copied. Stop copying token after the
limit of number of token instances has been reached. This worked before
only by chance as we had allocated more size for the tuples array than
the number of actual tokens being parsed.

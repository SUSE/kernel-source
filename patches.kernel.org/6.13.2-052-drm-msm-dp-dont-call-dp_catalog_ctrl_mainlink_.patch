Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: dont call dp_catalog_ctrl_mainlink_ctrl in
 dp_ctrl_configure_source_params()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: 50e608d166ba68faacf81a5ce17c09b0c697eefd

[ Upstream commit 50e608d166ba68faacf81a5ce17c09b0c697eefd ]

Once the link has already been setup there is no need to call
dp_catalog_ctrl_mainlink_ctrl() as this does a reset on the mainlink
thereby tearing down the link briefly.

Subject: [PATCH] ring-buffer: Protect ring_buffer_reset() from reentrancy
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.3
Git-commit: 51d157946666382e779f94c39891e8e9a020da78

commit 51d157946666382e779f94c39891e8e9a020da78 upstream.

The resetting of the entire ring buffer use to simply go through and reset
each individual CPU buffer that had its own protection and synchronization.
But this was very slow, due to performing a synchronization for each CPU.
The code was reshuffled to do one disabling of all CPU buffers, followed
by a single RCU synchronization, and then the resetting of each of the CPU
buffers. But unfortunately, the mutex that prevented multiple occurrences
of resetting the buffer was not moved to the upper function, and there is
nothing to protect from it.

Take the ring buffer mutex around the global reset.

References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.2
Git-commit: 883957bee580b723fd87d49ac73e0c84fc03a446

[ Upstream commit 883957bee580b723fd87d49ac73e0c84fc03a446 ]

On SA8295P and SA8540P gfx.lvl is not provdied by rpmh, but rather is
handled by an external regulator (max20411). Drop gfx.lvl from the list
of power-domains exposed on this platform.

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: i2c: at91: fix example for scl-gpios
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.4
Git-commit: 92e669017ff1616ba7d8ba3c65f5193bc2a7acbe

[ Upstream commit 92e669017ff1616ba7d8ba3c65f5193bc2a7acbe ]

The SCL gpio pin used by I2C bus for recovery needs to be configured as
open drain, so fix the binding example accordingly.
In relation with fix c5a283802573 ("ARM: dts: at91: Configure I2C SCL
gpio as open drain").

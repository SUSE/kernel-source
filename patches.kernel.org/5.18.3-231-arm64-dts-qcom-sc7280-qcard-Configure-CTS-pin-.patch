Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280-qcard: Configure CTS pin to
 bias-bus-hold for bluetooth
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: 3d0e375bae55c2dfa6dd0762f45ad71f0b192f71

[ Upstream commit 3d0e375bae55c2dfa6dd0762f45ad71f0b192f71 ]

WLAN rail was leaking power during RBSC/sleep even after turning BT off.
Change active and sleep pinctrl configurations to handle same.

Subject: [PATCH] i3c: add missing include to internal header
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: 3b661ca549b9e5bb11d0bc97ada6110aac3282d2

[ Upstream commit 3b661ca549b9e5bb11d0bc97ada6110aac3282d2 ]

LKP found a random config which failed to build because IO accessors
were not defined:

   In file included from drivers/i3c/master.c:21:
   drivers/i3c/internals.h: In function 'i3c_writel_fifo':
>> drivers/i3c/internals.h:35:9: error: implicit declaration of function 'writesl' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

Add the proper header to where the IO accessors are used.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: video: Add backlight=native quirk for Dell OptiPlex
 7760 AIO
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.7
Git-commit: 5c7bb62cb8f53de71d8ab3d619be22740da0b837

commit 5c7bb62cb8f53de71d8ab3d619be22740da0b837 upstream.

Dell All In One (AIO) models released after 2017 may use a backlight
controller board connected to an UART.

In DSDT this uart port will be defined as:

   Name (_HID, "DELL0501")
   Name (_CID, EisaId ("PNP0501")

The Dell OptiPlex 7760 AIO has an ACPI device for one if its UARTs with
the above _HID + _CID. Loading the dell-uart-backlight driver shows that
there actually is a backlight controller board attached to the UART,
which reports a firmware version of "G&MX01-V15".

But the backlight controller board does not actually control the backlight
brightness and the GPU's native backlight control method does work.

Add a quirk to use the GPU's native backlight control method on this model.

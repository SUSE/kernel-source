Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Update comment about link going down after
 link-up

commit 92f4ffecc4170ce29e67a1f8d51c168c3de95fb2 upstream.

Update the comment about what happens when link goes down after we have
checked for link-up. If a PIO request is done while link-down, we have
a serious problem.

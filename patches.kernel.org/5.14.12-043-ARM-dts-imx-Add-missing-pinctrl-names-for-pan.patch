Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx: Add missing pinctrl-names for panel on
 M53Menlo
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.12
Git-commit: c8c1efe14a4aadcfe93a158b1272e48298d2de15

[ Upstream commit c8c1efe14a4aadcfe93a158b1272e48298d2de15 ]

The panel already contains pinctrl-0 phandle, but it is missing
the default pinctrl-names property, so the pin configuration is
ignored. Fill in the missing pinctrl-names property, so the pin
configuration is applied.

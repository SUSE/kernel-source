Subject: [PATCH] module: sign with sha512 instead of sha1 by default
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.26
Git-commit: f3b93547b91ad849b58eb5ab2dd070950ad7beb3

commit f3b93547b91ad849b58eb5ab2dd070950ad7beb3 upstream.

Switch away from using sha1 for module signing by default and use the
more modern sha512 instead, which is what among others Arch, Fedora,
RHEL, and Ubuntu are currently using for their kernels.

Sha1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents since
2005[1]; since 2011 the NIST and other organizations furthermore
recommended its replacement[2]. This is why OpenSSL on RHEL9, Fedora
Linux 41+[3], and likely some other current and future distributions
reject the creation of sha1 signatures, which leads to a build error of
allmodconfig configurations:

  80A20474797F0000:error:03000098:digital envelope routines:do_sigver_init:invalid digest:crypto/evp/m_sigver.c:342:
  make[4]: *** [.../certs/Makefile:53: certs/signing_key.pem] Error 1
  make[4]: *** Deleting file 'certs/signing_key.pem'
  make[4]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
  make[3]: *** [.../scripts/Makefile.build:478: certs] Error 2
  make[2]: *** [.../Makefile:1936: .] Error 2
  make[1]: *** [.../Makefile:224: __sub-make] Error 2
  make[1]: Leaving directory '...'
  make: *** [Makefile:224: __sub-make] Error 2

This change makes allmodconfig work again and sets a default that is
more appropriate for current and future users, too.

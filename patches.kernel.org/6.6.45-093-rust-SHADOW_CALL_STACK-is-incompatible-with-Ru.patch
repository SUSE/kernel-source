Subject: [PATCH] rust: SHADOW_CALL_STACK is incompatible with Rust
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.45
Git-commit: f126745da81783fb1d082e67bf14c6795e489a88

commit f126745da81783fb1d082e67bf14c6795e489a88 upstream.

When using the shadow call stack sanitizer, all code must be compiled
with the -ffixed-x18 flag, but this flag is not currently being passed
to Rust. This results in crashes that are extremely difficult to debug.

To ensure that nobody else has to go through the same debugging session
that I had to, prevent configurations that enable both SHADOW_CALL_STACK
and RUST.

It is rather common for people to backport 724a75ac9542 ("arm64: rust:
Enable Rust support for AArch64"), so I recommend applying this fix all
the way back to 6.1.

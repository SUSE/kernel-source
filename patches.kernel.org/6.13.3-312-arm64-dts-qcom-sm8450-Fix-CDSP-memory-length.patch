Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: Fix CDSP memory length
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: 3751fe2cba2a9fba2204ef62102bc4bb027cec7b

commit 3751fe2cba2a9fba2204ef62102bc4bb027cec7b upstream.

The address space in CDSP PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)
remoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space
(QDSP6...SS_PUB) which has a length of 0x10000.  Value of 0x1400000 was
copied from older DTS, but it does not look accurate at all.

This should have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader
does not use this address space at all.

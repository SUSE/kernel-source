Subject: [PATCH] NIOS2: fix kconfig unmet dependency warning for
 SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.10
Git-commit: adfc8f9d2f9fefd880abc82cfbf62cbfe6539c97

[ Upstream commit adfc8f9d2f9fefd880abc82cfbf62cbfe6539c97 ]

SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE depends on TTY so EARLY_PRINTK should also
depend on TTY so that it does not select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
inadvertently.

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
  Depends on [n]: TTY [=n] && HAS_IOMEM [=y]
  Selected by [y]:
  - EARLY_PRINTK [=y]

commit 12653ec36112ab55fa06c01db7c4432653d30a8d upstream.

[BUG]
There is a bug report that using the latest trunk GCC 15, btrfs would cause
unterminated-string-initialization warning:

  linux-6.6/fs/btrfs/print-tree.c:29:49: error: initializer-string for array of ‘char’ is too long [-Werror=unterminated-string-initialization]
   29 |         { BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_TREE_OBJECTID,      "BLOCK_GROUP_TREE"      },
      |
      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[CAUSE]
To print tree names we have an array of root_name_map structure, which
uses "char name[16];" to store the name string of a tree.

But the following trees have names exactly at 16 chars length:
- "BLOCK_GROUP_TREE"
- "RAID_STRIPE_TREE"

This means we will have no space for the terminating '\0', and can lead
to unexpected access when printing the name.

[FIX]
Instead of "char name[16];" use "const char *" instead.

Since the name strings are all read-only data, and are all NULL
terminated by default, there is not much need to bother the length at
all.

Subject: [PATCH] usb: roles: set switch registered flag early on
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.16
Git-commit: 634775a752a86784511018a108f3b530cc3399a7

commit 634775a752a86784511018a108f3b530cc3399a7 upstream.

The role switch registration and set_role() can happen in parallel as they
are invoked independent of each other. There is a possibility that a driver
might spend significant amount of time in usb_role_switch_register() API
due to the presence of time intensive operations like component_add()
which operate under common mutex. This leads to a time window after
allocating the switch and before setting the registered flag where the set
role notifications are dropped. Below timeline summarizes this behavior

Thread1				|	Thread2
usb_role_switch_register()	|
	|			|
	---> allocate switch	|
	|			|
	---> component_add()	|	usb_role_switch_set_role()
	|			|	|
	|			|	--> Drop role notifications
	|			|	    since sw->registered
	|			|	    flag is not set.
	|			|
	--->Set registered flag.|

To avoid this, set the registered flag early on in the switch register
API.

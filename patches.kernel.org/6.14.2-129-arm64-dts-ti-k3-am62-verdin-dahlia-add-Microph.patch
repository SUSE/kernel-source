Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62-verdin-dahlia: add Microphone Jack to
 sound card
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: 7139df64e7c13c079b754476355c62b490213055

[ Upstream commit 7139df64e7c13c079b754476355c62b490213055 ]

The simple-audio-card's microphone widget currently connects to the
headphone jack. Routing the microphone input to the microphone jack
allows for independent operation of the microphone and headphones.

This resolves the following boot-time kernel log message, which
indicated a conflict when the microphone and headphone functions were
not separated:
  debugfs: File 'Headphone Jack' in directory 'dapm' already present!

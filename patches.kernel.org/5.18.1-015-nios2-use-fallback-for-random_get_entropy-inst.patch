Subject: [PATCH] nios2: use fallback for random_get_entropy() instead of zero
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.1
Git-commit: c04e72700f2293013dab40208e809369378f224c

commit c04e72700f2293013dab40208e809369378f224c upstream.

In the event that random_get_entropy() can't access a cycle counter or
similar, falling back to returning 0 is really not the best we can do.
Instead, at least calling random_get_entropy_fallback() would be
preferable, because that always needs to return _something_, even
falling back to jiffies eventually. It's not as though
random_get_entropy_fallback() is super high precision or guaranteed to
be entropic, but basically anything that's not zero all the time is
better than returning zero all the time.

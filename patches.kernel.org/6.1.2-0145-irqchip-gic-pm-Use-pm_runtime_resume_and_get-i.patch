Subject: [PATCH] irqchip: gic-pm: Use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() in
 gic_probe()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: f9ee20c85b3a3ba0afd3672630ec4f93d339f015

[ Upstream commit f9ee20c85b3a3ba0afd3672630ec4f93d339f015 ]

gic_probe() calls pm_runtime_get_sync() and added fail path as
rpm_put to put usage_counter. However, pm_runtime_get_sync()
will increment usage_counter even it failed. Fix it by replacing it with
pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to keep usage counter balanced.

Fixes: 9c8edddfc992 ("irqchip/gic: Add platform driver for non-root GICs that require RPM")

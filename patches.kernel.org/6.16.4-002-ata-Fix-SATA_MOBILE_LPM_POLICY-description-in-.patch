Subject: [PATCH] ata: Fix SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY description in Kconfig
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.4
Git-commit: ed62a62a18bc144f73eadf866ae46842e8f6606e

commit ed62a62a18bc144f73eadf866ae46842e8f6606e upstream.

Improve the description of the possible default SATA link power
management policies and add the missing description for policy 5.
No functional changes.

Fixes: a5ec5a7bfd1f ("ata: ahci: Support state with min power but Partial low power state")

 	  Select the Default SATA Link Power Management (LPM) policy to use
 	  for chipsets / "South Bridges" supporting low-power modes. Such
 	  chipsets are ubiquitous across laptops, desktops and servers.
-
-	  The value set has the following meanings:
+	  Each policy combines power saving states and features:
+	   - Partial: The Phy logic is powered but is in a reduced power
+                      state. The exit latency from this state is no longer than
+                      10us).
+	   - Slumber: The Phy logic is powered but is in an even lower power
+                      state. The exit latency from this state is potentially
+		      longer, but no longer than 10ms.
+	   - DevSleep: The Phy logic may be powered down. The exit latency from
+	               this state is no longer than 20 ms, unless otherwise
+		       specified by DETO in the device Identify Device Data log.
+	   - HIPM: Host Initiated Power Management (host automatically
+		   transitions to partial and slumber).
+	   - DIPM: Device Initiated Power Management (device automatically
+		   transitions to partial and slumber).
+
+	  The possible values for the default SATA link power management
+	  policies are:
 		0 => Keep firmware settings
-		1 => Maximum performance
-		2 => Medium power
-		3 => Medium power with Device Initiated PM enabled
-		4 => Minimum power
-
-	  Note "Minimum power" is known to cause issues, including disk
-	  corruption, with some disks and should not be used.
+		1 => No power savings (maximum performance)
+		2 => HIPM (Partial)
+		3 => HIPM (Partial) and DIPM (Partial and Slumber)
+		4 => HIPM (Partial and DevSleep) and DIPM (Partial and Slumber)
+		5 => HIPM (Slumber and DevSleep) and DIPM (Partial and Slumber)
+
+	  Excluding the value 0, higher values represent policies with higher
+	  power savings.

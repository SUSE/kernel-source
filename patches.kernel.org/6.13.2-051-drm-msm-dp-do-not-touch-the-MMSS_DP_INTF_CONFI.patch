Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dp: do not touch the MMSS_DP_INTF_CONFIG for tpg
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: 9ffbf5ef0e8d6e1b76440a6d77311d0c5d6e3979

[ Upstream commit 9ffbf5ef0e8d6e1b76440a6d77311d0c5d6e3979 ]

MMSS_DP_INTF_CONFIG has already been setup by the main datapath
for DP to account for widebus to be used/unused etc.

In current implementation, TPG only switches the DP controller
to use the main datapath stream OR use the test pattern but expects
the rest of the controller to be already setup.

Keeping the same behavior intact, drop the clearing of MMSS_DP_INTF_CONFIG
from the msm_dp_catalog_panel_tpg_enable() API.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Set max_brightness before using
 it
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Git-commit: 7a3c36eef9a5d13b16aa954da54224c9c6bed339

commit 7a3c36eef9a5d13b16aa954da54224c9c6bed339 upstream.

max_brightness is used in ideapad_kbd_bl_brightness_get() before it's set,
causing ideapad_kbd_bl_brightness_get() to return -EINVAL sometimes.

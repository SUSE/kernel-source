Subject: [PATCH] RISC-V: KVM: Disable the kernel perf counter during configure
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.2
Git-commit: bbb622488749478955485765ddff9d56be4a7e4b

[ Upstream commit bbb622488749478955485765ddff9d56be4a7e4b ]

The perf event should be marked disabled during the creation as
it is not ready to be scheduled until there is SBI PMU start call
or config matching is called with auto start. Otherwise, event add/start
gets called during perf_event_create_kernel_counter function.
It will be enabled and scheduled to run via perf_event_enable during
either the above mentioned scenario.

Fixes: 0cb74b65d2e5 ("RISC-V: KVM: Implement perf support without sampling")

Subject: [PATCH] spi: stm32: Don't warn about spurious interrupts
MIME-Version: 1.0

[ Upstream commit 95d7c452a26564ef0c427f2806761b857106d8c4 ]

The dev_warn to notify about a spurious interrupt was introduced with
the reasoning that these are unexpected. However spurious interrupts
tend to trigger continously and the error message on the serial console
prevents that the core's detection of spurious interrupts kicks in
(which disables the irq) and just floods the console.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: set correct pwm0 pinctrl on
 rk3588-tiger
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.8
Git-commit: a21d2cc2f9039023105bf9f9bf1acf324d5ebf9d

[ Upstream commit a21d2cc2f9039023105bf9f9bf1acf324d5ebf9d ]

PWM0 on rk3588-tiger is connected to the BLT_CTRL pin of the Q7 connector
meant as the name implies to control a backlight device.

Therefore set the correct M1 pinctrl variant for it. The M0 variant
cannot ever be used because that pin is routed to a connector pin on the
Q7 connector that is reserved for CAN use and the pin reachable by the M2
variant is reserved for the embedded MCU on the SoM.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Add HDMI PHY PLL clock source to VOP2
 on rk3576
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.4
Git-commit: 4ab8b8ac952fb08d03655e1da0cfee07589e428f

commit 4ab8b8ac952fb08d03655e1da0cfee07589e428f upstream.

Since commit c871a311edf0 ("phy: rockchip: samsung-hdptx: Setup TMDS
char rate via phy_configure_opts_hdmi"), the workaround of passing the
rate from DW HDMI QP bridge driver via phy_set_bus_width() became
partially broken, as it cannot reliably handle mode switches anymore.

Attempting to fix this up at PHY level would not only introduce
additional hacks, but it would also fail to adequately resolve the
display issues that are a consequence of the system CRU limitations.

Instead, proceed with the solution already implemented for RK3588: make
use of the HDMI PHY PLL as a better suited DCLK source for VOP2. This
will not only address the aforementioned problem, but it should also
facilitate the proper operation of display modes up to 4K@60Hz.

It's worth noting that anything above 4K@30Hz still requires high TMDS
clock ratio and scrambling support, which hasn't been mainlined yet.

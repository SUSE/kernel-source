Subject: [PATCH] OPP: Pass rounded rate to _set_opp()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.15
Git-commit: 7269c250db1b89cda72ca419b7bd5e37997309d6

commit 7269c250db1b89cda72ca419b7bd5e37997309d6 upstream.

The OPP core finds the eventual frequency to set with the help of
clk_round_rate() and the same was earlier getting passed to _set_opp()
and that's what would get configured.

The commit 1efae8d2e777 ("OPP: Make dev_pm_opp_set_opp() independent of
frequency") mistakenly changed that. Fix it.

Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: ep0: Don't clear ep0 DWC3_EP_TRANSFER_STARTED
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: 5d2fb074dea289c41f5aaf2c3f68286bee370634

commit 5d2fb074dea289c41f5aaf2c3f68286bee370634 upstream.

The driver cannot issue the End Transfer command to the SETUP transfer.
Don't clear DWC3_EP_TRANSFER_STARTED flag to make sure that the driver
won't send Start Transfer command again, which can cause no-resource
error. For example this can occur if the host issues a reset to the
device.

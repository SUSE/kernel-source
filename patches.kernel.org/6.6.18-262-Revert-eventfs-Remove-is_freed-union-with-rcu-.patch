Subject: [PATCH] Revert "eventfs: Remove "is_freed" union with rcu head"
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.18
Git-commit: 4015fc49277472bce9e26378c3a3d257615338d9

This reverts commit fa18a8a0539b02cc621938091691f0b73f0b1288.

The eventfs was not designed properly and may have some hidden bugs in it.
Linus rewrote it properly and I trust his version more than this one. Revert
the backported patches for 6.6 and re-apply all the changes to make it
equivalent to Linus's version.

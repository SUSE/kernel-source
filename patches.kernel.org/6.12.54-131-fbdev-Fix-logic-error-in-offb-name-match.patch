Subject: [PATCH] fbdev: Fix logic error in "offb" name match
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.54
Git-commit: 15df28699b28d6b49dc305040c4e26a9553df07a

commit 15df28699b28d6b49dc305040c4e26a9553df07a upstream.

A regression was reported to me recently whereby /dev/fb0 had disappeared
from a PowerBook G3 Series "Wallstreet". The problem shows up when the
"video=ofonly" parameter is passed to the kernel, which is what the
bootloader does when "no video driver" is selected. The cause of the
problem is the "offb" string comparison, which got mangled when it got
refactored. Fix it.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/panel: st7701: Fix AVCL calculation
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.14
Git-commit: 799825aa87200ade1ba21db853d1c2ff720dcfe0

[ Upstream commit 799825aa87200ade1ba21db853d1c2ff720dcfe0 ]

The AVCL register, according to the datasheet, comes in increments
of -0.2v between -4.4v (represented by 0x0) to -5.0v (represented
by 0x3). The current calculation is done by adding the defined
AVCL value in mV to -4400 and then dividing by 200 to get the register
value. Unfortunately if I subtract -4400 from -4400 I get -8800, which
divided by 200 gives me -44. If I instead subtract -4400 from -4400
I get 0, which divided by 200 gives me 0. Based on the datasheet this
is the expected register value.

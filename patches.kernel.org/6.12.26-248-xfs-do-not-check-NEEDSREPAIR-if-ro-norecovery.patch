Subject: [PATCH] xfs: do not check NEEDSREPAIR if ro,norecovery mount.
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.26
Git-commit: 9e00163c31676c6b43d2334fdf5b406232f42dee

Commit 9e00163c31676c6b43d2334fdf5b406232f42dee upstream

If there is corrutpion on the filesystem andxfs_repair
fails to repair it. The last resort of getting the data
is to use norecovery,ro mount. But if the NEEDSREPAIR is
set the filesystem cannot be mounted. The flag must be
cleared out manually using xfs_db, to get access to what
left over of the corrupted fs.

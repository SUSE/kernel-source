Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: video: Use acpi_device_fix_up_power_children()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.4
Git-commit: c93695494606326d7fd72b46a2a657139ccb0dec

commit c93695494606326d7fd72b46a2a657139ccb0dec upstream.

Commit 89c290ea7589 ("ACPI: video: Put ACPI video and its child devices
into D0 on boot") introduced calling acpi_device_fix_up_power_extended()
on the video card for which the ACPI video bus is the companion device.

This unnecessarily touches the power-state of the GPU itself, while
the issue it tries to address only requires calling _PS0 on the child
devices.

Touching the power-state of the GPU itself is causing suspend / resume
issues on e.g. a Lenovo ThinkPad W530.

Instead use acpi_device_fix_up_power_children(), which only touches
the child devices, to fix this.

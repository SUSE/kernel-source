Subject: [PATCH] wifi: cfg80211: fix kernel-doc for wiphy_delayed_work_flush()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.63
Git-commit: 8c73d5248dcf112611654bcd32352dc330b02397

commit 8c73d5248dcf112611654bcd32352dc330b02397 upstream.

Clearly, there's no space in the function name, not sure how
that could've happened. Put the underscore that it should be.

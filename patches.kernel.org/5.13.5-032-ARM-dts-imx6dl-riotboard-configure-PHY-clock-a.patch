Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6dl-riotboard: configure PHY clock and set
 proper EEE value
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.13.5
Git-commit: 723de6a4126b2474a8106e943749e1554012dad6

[ Upstream commit 723de6a4126b2474a8106e943749e1554012dad6 ]

Without SoC specific PHY fixups the network interface on this board will
fail to work. Provide missing DT properties to make it work again.

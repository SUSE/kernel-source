Subject: [PATCH] can: {cc770,sja1000}_isa: allow building on x86_64
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

commit 7b22846f8af5ab2f267de9eb209fb1835ee9978c upstream.

The ISA variable is only defined if X86_32 is also defined. However,
these drivers are still useful and in use on at least some modern 64-bit
x86 industrial systems as well. With the correct module parameters, they
work as long as IO port communication is possible, despite their name
having ISA in them.

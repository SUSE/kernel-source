Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Fix redefinition errors compiling
 lwt_reroute.c
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.2
Git-commit: 16b795cc59528cf280abc79af3c70bda42f715b9

[ Upstream commit 16b795cc59528cf280abc79af3c70bda42f715b9 ]

Compiling lwt_reroute.c with GCC 12.3 for mips64el/musl-libc yields errors:

These errors occur because <linux/in6.h> is included before <netinet/in.h>,
bypassing the Linux uapi/libc compat mechanism's partial musl support. As
described in [1] and [2], fix these errors by including <netinet/in.h> in
lwt_reroute.c before any uapi headers.

[1]: commit c0bace798436 ("uapi libc compat: add fallback for unsupported libcs")
[2]: https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/commit/?id=04983f227238

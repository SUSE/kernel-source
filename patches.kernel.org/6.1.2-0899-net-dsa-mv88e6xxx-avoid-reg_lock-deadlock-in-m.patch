Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid reg_lock deadlock in
 mv88e6xxx_setup_port()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: a7d82367daa6baa5e8399e6327e7f2f463534505

[ Upstream commit a7d82367daa6baa5e8399e6327e7f2f463534505 ]

In the blamed commit, it was not noticed that one implementation of
chip->info->ops->phylink_get_caps(), called by mv88e6xxx_get_caps(),
may access hardware registers, and in doing so, it takes the
mv88e6xxx_reg_lock(). Namely, this is mv88e6352_phylink_get_caps().

This is a problem because mv88e6xxx_get_caps(), apart from being
a top-level function (method invoked by dsa_switch_ops), is now also
directly called from mv88e6xxx_setup_port(), which runs under the
mv88e6xxx_reg_lock() taken by mv88e6xxx_setup(). Therefore, when running
on mv88e6352, the reg_lock would be acquired a second time and the
system would deadlock on driver probe.

The things that mv88e6xxx_setup() can compete with in terms of register
access with are the IRQ handlers and MDIO bus operations registered by
mv88e6xxx_probe(). So there is a real need to acquire the register lock.

The register lock can, in principle, be dropped and re-acquired pretty
much at will within the driver, as long as no operations that involve
waiting for indirect access to complete (essentially, callers of
mv88e6xxx_smi_direct_wait() and mv88e6xxx_wait_mask()) are interrupted
with the lock released. However, I would guess that in mv88e6xxx_setup(),
the critical section is kept open for such a long time just in order to
optimize away multiple lock/unlock operations on the registers.

We could, in principle, drop the reg_lock right before the
mv88e6xxx_setup_port() -> mv88e6xxx_get_caps() call, and
re-acquire it immediately afterwards. But this would look ugly, because
mv88e6xxx_setup_port() would release a lock which it didn't acquire, but
the caller did.

A cleaner solution to this issue comes from the observation that struct
mv88e6xxxx_ops methods generally assume they are called with the
reg_lock already acquired. Whereas mv88e6352_phylink_get_caps() is more
the exception rather than the norm, in that it acquires the lock itself.

Let's enforce the same locking pattern/convention for
chip->info->ops->phylink_get_caps() as well, and make
mv88e6xxx_get_caps(), the top-level function, acquire the register lock
explicitly, for this one implementation that will access registers for
port 4 to work properly.

This means that mv88e6xxx_setup_port() will no longer call the top-level
function, but the low-level mv88e6xxx_ops method which expects the
correct calling context (register lock held).

Compared to chip->info->ops->phylink_get_caps(), mv88e6xxx_get_caps()
also fixes up the supported_interfaces bitmap for internal ports, since
that can be done generically and does not require per-switch knowledge.
That's code which will no longer execute, however mv88e6xxx_setup_port()
doesn't need that. It just needs to look at the mac_capabilities bitmap.

Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: always prep_async for drain requests
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.9
Git-commit: ef5c600adb1d985513d2b612cc90403a148ff287

[ Upstream commit ef5c600adb1d985513d2b612cc90403a148ff287 ]

Drain requests all go through io_drain_req, which has a quick exit in case
there is nothing pending (ie the drain is not useful). In that case it can
run the issue the request immediately.

However for safety it queues it through task work.
The problem is that in this case the request is run asynchronously, but
the async work has not been prepared through io_req_prep_async.

This has not been a problem up to now, as the task work always would run
before returning to userspace, and so the user would not have a chance to
race with it.

However - with IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN - this is no longer the case and
the work might be defered, giving userspace a chance to change data being
referred to in the request.

Instead _always_ prep_async for drain requests, which is simpler anyway
and removes this issue.

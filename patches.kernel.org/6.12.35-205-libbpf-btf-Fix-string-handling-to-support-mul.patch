Subject: [PATCH] libbpf/btf: Fix string handling to support multi-split BTF
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.35
Git-commit: 4e29128a9acec2a622734844bedee013e2901bdf

[ Upstream commit 4e29128a9acec2a622734844bedee013e2901bdf ]

libbpf handling of split BTF has been written largely with the
assumption that multiple splits are possible, i.e. split BTF on top of
split BTF on top of base BTF.  One area where this does not quite work
is string handling in split BTF; the start string offset should be the
base BTF string section length + the base BTF string offset.  This
worked in the past because for a single split BTF with base the start
string offset was always 0.

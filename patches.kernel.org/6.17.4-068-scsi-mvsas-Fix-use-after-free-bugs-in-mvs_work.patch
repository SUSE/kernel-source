Subject: [PATCH] scsi: mvsas: Fix use-after-free bugs in mvs_work_queue
References: bsc#1012628 CVE-2025-40001 bsc#1252303
Patch-mainline: 6.17.4
Git-commit: 60cd16a3b7439ccb699d0bf533799eeb894fd217

[ Upstream commit 60cd16a3b7439ccb699d0bf533799eeb894fd217 ]

During the detaching of Marvell's SAS/SATA controller, the original code
calls cancel_delayed_work() in mvs_free() to cancel the delayed work
item mwq->work_q. However, if mwq->work_q is already running, the
cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel it. This can lead to
use-after-free scenarios where mvs_free() frees the mvs_info while
mvs_work_queue() is still executing and attempts to access the
already-freed mvs_info.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (remove)            | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
mvs_pci_remove()          |
  mvs_free()              | mvs_work_queue()
    cancel_delayed_work() |
      kfree(mvi)          |
                          |   mvi-> // UAF

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the delayed work item is properly canceled and any executing
delayed work item completes before the mvs_info is deallocated.

This bug was found by static analysis.

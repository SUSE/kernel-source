Subject: [PATCH] mm: huge_memory: add vma_thp_disabled() and
 thp_disabled_by_hw()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.60
Git-commit: 963756aac1f011d904ddd9548ae82286d3a91f96

commit 963756aac1f011d904ddd9548ae82286d3a91f96 upstream.

Patch series "mm: don't install PMD mappings when THPs are disabled by the
hw/process/vma".

During testing, it was found that we can get PMD mappings in processes
where THP (and more precisely, PMD mappings) are supposed to be disabled.
While it works as expected for anon+shmem, the pagecache is the
problematic bit.

For s390 KVM this currently means that a VM backed by a file located on
filesystem with large folio support can crash when KVM tries accessing the
problematic page, because the readahead logic might decide to use a
PMD-sized THP and faulting it into the page tables will install a PMD
mapping, something that s390 KVM cannot tolerate.

This might also be a problem with HW that does not support PMD mappings,
but I did not try reproducing it.

Fix it by respecting the ways to disable THPs when deciding whether we can
install a PMD mapping.  khugepaged should already be taking care of not
collapsing if THPs are effectively disabled for the hw/process/vma.


This patch (of 2):

Add vma_thp_disabled() and thp_disabled_by_hw() helpers to be shared by
shmem_allowable_huge_orders() and __thp_vma_allowable_orders().

[david@redhat.com: rename to vma_thp_disabled(), split out thp_disabled_by_hw() ]

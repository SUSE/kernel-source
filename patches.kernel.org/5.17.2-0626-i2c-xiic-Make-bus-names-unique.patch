Subject: [PATCH] i2c: xiic: Make bus names unique
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: 1d366c2f9df8279df2adbb60471f86fc40a1c39e

[ Upstream commit 1d366c2f9df8279df2adbb60471f86fc40a1c39e ]

This driver is for an FPGA logic core, so there can be arbitrarily many
instances of the bus on a given system. Previously all of the I2C bus
names were "xiic-i2c" which caused issues with lm_sensors when trying to
map human-readable names to sensor inputs because it could not properly
distinguish the busses, for example. Append the platform device name to
the I2C bus name so it is unique between different instances.

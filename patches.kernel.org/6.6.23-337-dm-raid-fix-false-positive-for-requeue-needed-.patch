Subject: [PATCH] dm raid: fix false positive for requeue needed during reshape
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: b25b8f4b8ecef0f48c05f0c3572daeabefe16526

[ Upstream commit b25b8f4b8ecef0f48c05f0c3572daeabefe16526 ]

An empty flush doesn't have a payload, so it should never be looked at
when considering to possibly requeue a bio for the case when a reshape
is in progress.

Fixes: 9dbd1aa3a81c ("dm raid: add reshaping support to the target")

Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: taint kernel when force probing unsupported devices
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: 79c901c93562bdf1c84ce6c1b744fbbe4389a6eb

[ Upstream commit 79c901c93562bdf1c84ce6c1b744fbbe4389a6eb ]

For development and testing purposes, the i915.force_probe module
parameter and DRM_I915_FORCE_PROBE kconfig option allow probing of
devices that aren't supported by the driver.

The i915.force_probe module parameter is "unsafe" and setting it taints
the kernel. However, using the kconfig option does not.

Always taint the kernel when force probing a device that is not
supported.

v2: Drop "depends on EXPERT" to avoid build breakage (kernel test robot)

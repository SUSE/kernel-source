Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: fix possible oops when nfsd/pool_stats is closed.
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.71
Git-commit: 88956eabfdea7d01d550535af120d4ef265b1d02

commit 88956eabfdea7d01d550535af120d4ef265b1d02 upstream.

If /proc/fs/nfsd/pool_stats is open when the last nfsd thread exits, then
when the file is closed a NULL pointer is dereferenced.
This is because nfsd_pool_stats_release() assumes that the
pointer to the svc_serv cannot become NULL while a reference is held.

This used to be the case but a recent patch split nfsd_last_thread() out
from nfsd_put(), and clearing the pointer is done in nfsd_last_thread().

This is easily reproduced by running
   rpc.nfsd 8 ; ( rpc.nfsd 0;true) < /proc/fs/nfsd/pool_stats

Fortunately nfsd_pool_stats_release() has easy access to the svc_serv
pointer, and so can call svc_put() on it directly.

Fixes: 9f28a971ee9f ("nfsd: separate nfsd_last_thread() from nfsd_put()")

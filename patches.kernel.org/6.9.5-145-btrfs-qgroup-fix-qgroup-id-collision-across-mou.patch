Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: qgroup: fix qgroup id collision across mounts
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.5
Git-commit: 2b8aa78cf1279ec5e418baa26bfed5df682568d8

commit 2b8aa78cf1279ec5e418baa26bfed5df682568d8 upstream.

If we delete subvolumes whose ID is the largest in the filesystem, then
unmount and mount again, then btrfs_init_root_free_objectid on the
tree_root will select a subvolid smaller than that one and thus allow
reusing it.

If we are also using qgroups (and particularly squotas) it is possible
to delete the subvol without deleting the qgroup. In that case, we will
be able to create a new subvol whose id already has a level 0 qgroup.
This will result in re-using that qgroup which would then lead to
incorrect accounting.

Fixes: 6ed05643ddb1 ("btrfs: create qgroup earlier in snapshot creation")

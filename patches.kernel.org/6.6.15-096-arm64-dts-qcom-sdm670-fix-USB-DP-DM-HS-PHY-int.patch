Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sdm670: fix USB DP/DM HS PHY interrupts
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.15
Git-commit: c42d12ea105f67b0f137f1e52d5c59d13fe12b1f

commit c42d12ea105f67b0f137f1e52d5c59d13fe12b1f upstream.

The USB DP/DM HS PHY interrupts need to be provided by the PDC interrupt
controller in order to be able to wake the system up from low-power
states and to be able to detect disconnect events, which requires
triggering on falling edges.

A recent commit updated the trigger type but failed to change the
interrupt provider as required. This leads to the current Linux driver
failing to probe instead of printing an error during suspend and USB
wakeup not working as intended.

Fixes: de3b3de30999 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sdm670: fix USB wakeup interrupt types")
Fixes: 07c8ded6e373 ("arm64: dts: qcom: add sdm670 and pixel 3a device trees")

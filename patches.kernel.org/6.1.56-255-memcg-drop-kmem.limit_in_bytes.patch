Subject: [PATCH] memcg: drop kmem.limit_in_bytes
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.56
Git-commit: 86327e8eb94c52eca4f93cfece2e29d1bf52acbf

commit 86327e8eb94c52eca4f93cfece2e29d1bf52acbf upstream.

kmem.limit_in_bytes (v1 way to limit kernel memory usage) has been
deprecated since 58056f77502f ("memcg, kmem: further deprecate
kmem.limit_in_bytes") merged in 5.16.  We haven't heard about any serious
users since then but it seems that the mere presence of the file is
causing more harm thatn good.  We (SUSE) have had several bug reports from
customers where Docker based containers started to fail because a write to
kmem.limit_in_bytes has failed.

This was unexpected because runc code only expects ENOENT (kmem disabled)
or EBUSY (tasks already running within cgroup).  So a new error code was
unexpected and the whole container startup failed.  This has been later
addressed by
https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/52390d68040637dfc77f9fda6bbe70952423d380
so current Docker runtimes do not suffer from the problem anymore.  There
are still older version of Docker in use and likely hard to get rid of
completely.

Address this by wiping out the file completely and effectively get back to
pre 4.5 era and CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM=n configuration.

I would recommend backporting to stable trees which have picked up
58056f77502f ("memcg, kmem: further deprecate kmem.limit_in_bytes").

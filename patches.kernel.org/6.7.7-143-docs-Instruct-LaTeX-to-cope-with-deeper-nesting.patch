Subject: [PATCH] docs: Instruct LaTeX to cope with deeper nesting
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: 0df8669f69a8638f04c6a3d1f3b7056c2c18f62c

commit 0df8669f69a8638f04c6a3d1f3b7056c2c18f62c upstream.

The addition of the XFS online fsck documentation starting with
commit a8f6c2e54ddc ("xfs: document the motivation for online fsck design")
added a deeper level of nesting than LaTeX is prepared to deal with.  That
caused a pdfdocs build failure with the helpful "Too deeply nested" error
message buried deeply in Documentation/output/filesystems.log.

Increase the "maxlistdepth" parameter to instruct LaTeX that it needs to
deal with the deeper nesting whether it wants to or not.

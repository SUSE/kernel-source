[ Upstream commit 578ce69ffda49d6c1a252490553290d1f27199f0 ]

The bpf_ct_set_nat_info() kfunc is defined in the nf_nat.ko module, and
takes as a parameter the nf_conn___init struct, which is allocated through
the bpf_xdp_ct_alloc() helper defined in the nf_conntrack.ko module.
However, because kernel modules can't deduplicate BTF types between each
other, and the nf_conn___init struct is not referenced anywhere in vmlinux
BTF, this leads to two distinct BTF IDs for the same type (one in each
module). This confuses the verifier, as described here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/87leoh372s.fsf@toke.dk/

As a workaround, add an explicit BTF_TYPE_EMIT for the type in
net/filter.c, so the type definition gets included in vmlinux BTF. This
way, both modules can refer to the same type ID (as they both build on top
of vmlinux BTF), and the verifier is no longer confused.

v2:

- Use BTF_TYPE_EMIT (which is a statement so it has to be inside a function
  definition; use xdp_func_proto() for this, since this is mostly
  xdp-related).

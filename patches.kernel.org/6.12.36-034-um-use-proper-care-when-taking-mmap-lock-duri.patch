Subject: [PATCH] um: use proper care when taking mmap lock during segfault
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.36
Git-commit: 6767e8784cd2e8b386a62330ea6864949d983a3e

[ Upstream commit 6767e8784cd2e8b386a62330ea6864949d983a3e ]

Segfaults can occur at times where the mmap lock cannot be taken. If
that happens the segfault handler may not be able to take the mmap lock.

Fix the code to use the same approach as most other architectures.
Unfortunately, this requires copying code from mm/memory.c and modifying
it slightly as UML does not have exception tables.

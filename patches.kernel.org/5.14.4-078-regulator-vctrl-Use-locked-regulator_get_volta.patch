Subject: [PATCH] regulator: vctrl: Use locked regulator_get_voltage in probe
 path
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.4
Git-commit: 98e47570ba985f2310586c80409238200fa3170f

[ Upstream commit 98e47570ba985f2310586c80409238200fa3170f ]

In commit e9153311491d ("regulator: vctrl-regulator: Avoid deadlock getting
and setting the voltage"), all calls to get/set the voltage of the
control regulator were switched to unlocked versions to avoid deadlocks.
However, the call in the probe path is done without regulator locks
held. In this case the locked version should be used.

Switch back to the locked regulator_get_voltage() in the probe path to
avoid any mishaps.

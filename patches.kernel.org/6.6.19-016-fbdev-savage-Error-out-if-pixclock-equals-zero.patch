Subject: [PATCH] fbdev: savage: Error out if pixclock equals zero
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.19
Git-commit: 04e5eac8f3ab2ff52fa191c187a46d4fdbc1e288

[ Upstream commit 04e5eac8f3ab2ff52fa191c187a46d4fdbc1e288 ]

The userspace program could pass any values to the driver through
ioctl() interface. If the driver doesn't check the value of pixclock,
it may cause divide-by-zero error.

Although pixclock is checked in savagefb_decode_var(), but it is not
checked properly in savagefb_probe(). Fix this by checking whether
pixclock is zero in the function savagefb_check_var() before
info->var.pixclock is used as the divisor.

This is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed by
commit 15cf0b8.

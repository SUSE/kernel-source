Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8188: Fix USB3 PHY port default
 status
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: 6bb64877a41561bc78e0f4e9e04d524a0155d6aa

[ Upstream commit 6bb64877a41561bc78e0f4e9e04d524a0155d6aa ]

The T-PHY controller at 0x11e40000 controls two underlying USB2 and USB3
PHY ports. The USB3 port works normally just like the others, so there's
no point in disabling it separately. Otherwise, board DTs would have to
enable both the T-PHY controller and one of its sub-nodes in particular,
which is slightly redundant and confusing.

Remove the status line in the u3port1 node, so it's ready to be used
once the T-PHY controller is enabled.

Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Untangle NEXT_BUDDY and pick_next_task()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: 2a77e4be12cb58bbf774e7c717c8bb80e128b7a4

[ Upstream commit 2a77e4be12cb58bbf774e7c717c8bb80e128b7a4 ]

There are 3 sites using set_next_buddy() and only one is conditional
on NEXT_BUDDY, the other two sites are unconditional; to note:

  - yield_to_task()
  - cgroup dequeue / pick optimization

However, having NEXT_BUDDY control both the wakeup-preemption and the
picking side of things means its near useless.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Skip VMSA init in sev_es_init_vmcb() if pointer is
 NULL
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.4
Git-commit: 1952e74da96fb3e48b72a2d0ece78c688a5848c1

commit 1952e74da96fb3e48b72a2d0ece78c688a5848c1 upstream.

Skip initializing the VMSA physical address in the VMCB if the VMSA is
NULL, which occurs during intrahost migration as KVM initializes the VMCB
before copying over state from the source to the destination (including
the VMSA and its physical address).

In normal builds, __pa() is just math, so the bug isn't fatal, but with
CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL=y, the validity of the virtual address is verified
and passing in NULL will make the kernel unhappy.

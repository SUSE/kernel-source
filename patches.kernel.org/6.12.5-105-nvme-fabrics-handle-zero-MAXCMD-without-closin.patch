Subject: [PATCH] nvme-fabrics: handle zero MAXCMD without closing the
 connection
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.5
Git-commit: 88c23a32b851e36adc4ab36f796d9b711f47e2bb

[ Upstream commit 88c23a32b851e36adc4ab36f796d9b711f47e2bb ]

The NVMe specification states that MAXCMD is mandatory
for NVMe-over-Fabrics implementations. However, some NVMe/TCP
and NVMe/FC arrays from major vendors have buggy firmware
that reports MAXCMD as zero in the Identify Controller data structure.

Currently, the implementation closes the connection in such cases,
completely preventing the host from connecting to the target.

Fix the issue by printing a clear error message about the firmware bug
and allowing the connection to proceed. It assumes that the
target supports a MAXCMD value of SQSIZE + 1. If any issues arise,
the user can manually adjust SQSIZE to mitigate them.

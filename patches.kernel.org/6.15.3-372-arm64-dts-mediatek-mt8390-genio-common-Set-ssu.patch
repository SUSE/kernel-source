Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8390-genio-common: Set ssusb2 default
 dual role mode to host
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: f9167f15dd4e70b124023a2f7ba2b09401b3b6ff

[ Upstream commit f9167f15dd4e70b124023a2f7ba2b09401b3b6ff ]

On the Mediatek Genio 510-EVK and 700-EVK boards, ssusb2 controller is
one but has two ports: one is routed to the M.2 slot, the other is on
the RPi header who does support full OTG.
Since Mediatek Genio 700-EVK USB support was added, dual role mode
property is set to otg for ssusb2. This config prevents the M.2
Wifi/Bluetooth module, present on those boards and exposing Bluetooth
as an USB device to be properly detected at startup as the default role
is device.
To keep the OTG functionality and make the M.2 module be detected at
the same time, add role-switch-default-mode property set to host and
also fix the polarity of GPIO associated to the USB connector, so the
ssusb2 controller role is properly set to host when the other port is
unused.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: sof_es8336: fix possible use-after-free in
 sof_es8336_remove()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: 1b41beaa7a58467505ec3023af8aad74f878b888

[ Upstream commit 1b41beaa7a58467505ec3023af8aad74f878b888 ]

sof_es8336_remove() calls cancel_delayed_work(). However, that
function does not wait until the work function finishes. This
means that the callback function may still be running after
the driver's remove function has finished, which would result
in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that
the work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and unable
to re-schedule itself.

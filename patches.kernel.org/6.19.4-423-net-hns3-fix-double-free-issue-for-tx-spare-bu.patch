Subject: [PATCH] net: hns3: fix double free issue for tx spare buffer
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: 6d2f142b1e4b203387a92519d9d2e34752a79dbb

[ Upstream commit 6d2f142b1e4b203387a92519d9d2e34752a79dbb ]

In hns3_set_ringparam(), a temporary copy (tmp_rings) of the ring structure
is created for rollback. However, the tx_spare pointer in the original
ring handle is incorrectly left pointing to the old backup memory.

Later, if memory allocation fails in hns3_init_all_ring() during the setup,
the error path attempts to free all newly allocated rings. Since tx_spare
contains a stale (non-NULL) pointer from the backup, it is mistaken for
a newly allocated buffer and is erroneously freed, leading to a double-free
of the backup memory.

The root cause is that the tx_spare field was not cleared after its value
was saved in tmp_rings, leaving a dangling pointer.

Fix this by setting tx_spare to NULL in the original ring structure
when the creation of the new `tx_spare` fails. This ensures the
error cleanup path only frees genuinely newly allocated buffers.

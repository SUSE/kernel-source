Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: Do not get extcon device when usb-role-switch is
 used
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: d68cc25b7c7fb3034c5a5b5f350a0b858c6d5a45

commit d68cc25b7c7fb3034c5a5b5f350a0b858c6d5a45 upstream.

The change breaks device tree based platforms with PHY device and use
usb-role-switch instead of an extcon switch. extcon_find_edev_by_node()
will return EPROBE_DEFER if it can not find a device so probing without
an extcon device will be deferred indefinitely. Fix this by
explicitly checking for usb-role-switch.
At least the out-of-tree USB3 support on Apple silicon based platforms
using dwc3 with tipd USB Type-C and PD controller is affected by this
issue.

Fixes: d182c2e1bc92 ("usb: dwc3: Don't switch OTG -> peripheral if extcon is present")

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm6115: Disable SS instance in Parkmode for
 USB
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.2
Git-commit: 074992a1163295d717faa21d1818c4c19ef6e676

commit 074992a1163295d717faa21d1818c4c19ef6e676 upstream.

For Gen-1 targets like SM6115, it is seen that stressing out the
controller in host mode results in HC died error:

 xhci-hcd.12.auto: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
 xhci-hcd.12.auto: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
 xhci-hcd.12.auto: HC died; cleaning up

And at this instant only restarting the host mode fixes it. Disable
SuperSpeed instance in park mode for SM6115 to mitigate this issue.

Subject: [PATCH] Drivers: hv: vmbus: Log on missing offers if any
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.5
Git-commit: fcf5203e289ca0ef75a18ce74a9eb716f7f1f569

commit fcf5203e289ca0ef75a18ce74a9eb716f7f1f569 upstream.

When resuming from hibernation, log any channels that were present
before hibernation but now are gone.
In general, the boot-time devices configured for a resuming VM should be
the same as the devices in the VM at the time of hibernation. It's
uncommon for the configuration to have been changed such that offers
are missing. Changing the configuration violates the rules for
hibernation anyway.
The cleanup of missing channels is not straight-forward and dependent
on individual device driver functionality and implementation,
so it can be added in future with separate changes.

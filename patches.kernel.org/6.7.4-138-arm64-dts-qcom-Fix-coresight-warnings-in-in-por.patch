Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: Fix coresight warnings in in-ports and
 out-ports
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.4
Git-commit: bdb6339fd46b8702ea7411b0b414587b86a40562

[ Upstream commit bdb6339fd46b8702ea7411b0b414587b86a40562 ]

When a node is only one in port or one out port, address-cells and
size-cells are not required in in-ports and out-ports. And the number
and reg of the port need to be removed.

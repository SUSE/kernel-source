Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: at91: sama7g5: remove interrupt-parent from gic
 node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.3
Git-commit: b7e86ef7afd128577ff7bb0db0ae82d27d7ed7ad

[ Upstream commit b7e86ef7afd128577ff7bb0db0ae82d27d7ed7ad ]

interrupt-parent is not to be used as a boolean property.
It is already present in the DT in the proper way it's supposed to be used:
interrupt-parent = <&gic>;

This is also reported by dtbs_check:
arch/arm/boot/dts/at91-sama7g5ek.dtb: interrupt-controller@e8c11000: interrupt-parent: True is not of type 'array'
	From schema: /.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/dtschema/schemas/interrupts.yaml

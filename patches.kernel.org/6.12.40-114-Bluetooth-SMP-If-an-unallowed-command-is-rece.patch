Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: SMP: If an unallowed command is received consider
 it a failure
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.40
Git-commit: fe4840df0bdf341f376885271b7680764fe6b34e

[ Upstream commit fe4840df0bdf341f376885271b7680764fe6b34e ]

If a command is received while a bonding is ongoing consider it a
pairing failure so the session is cleanup properly and the device is
disconnected immediately instead of continuing with other commands that
may result in the session to get stuck without ever completing such as
the case bellow:

> ACL Data RX: Handle 2048 flags 0x02 dlen 21
      SMP: Identity Information (0x08) len 16
        Identity resolving key[16]: d7e08edef97d3e62cd2331f82d8073b0
> ACL Data RX: Handle 2048 flags 0x02 dlen 21
      SMP: Signing Information (0x0a) len 16
        Signature key[16]: 1716c536f94e843a9aea8b13ffde477d
Bluetooth: hci0: unexpected SMP command 0x0a from XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
> ACL Data RX: Handle 2048 flags 0x02 dlen 12
      SMP: Identity Address Information (0x09) len 7
        Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Intel Corporate)

While accourding to core spec 6.1 the expected order is always BD_ADDR
first first then CSRK:

When using LE legacy pairing, the keys shall be distributed in the
following order:

    LTK by the Peripheral

    EDIV and Rand by the Peripheral

    IRK by the Peripheral

    BD_ADDR by the Peripheral

    CSRK by the Peripheral

    LTK by the Central

    EDIV and Rand by the Central

    IRK by the Central

    BD_ADDR by the Central

    CSRK by the Central

When using LE Secure Connections, the keys shall be distributed in the
following order:

    IRK by the Peripheral

    BD_ADDR by the Peripheral

    CSRK by the Peripheral

    IRK by the Central

    BD_ADDR by the Central

    CSRK by the Central

According to the Core 6.1 for commands used for key distribution "Key
Rejected" can be used:

  '3.6.1. Key distribution and generation

  A device may reject a distributed key by sending the Pairing Failed command
  with the reason set to "Key Rejected".

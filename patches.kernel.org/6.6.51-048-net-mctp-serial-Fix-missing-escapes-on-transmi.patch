Subject: [PATCH] net: mctp-serial: Fix missing escapes on transmit
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.51
Git-commit: f962e8361adfa84e8252d3fc3e5e6bb879f029b1

commit f962e8361adfa84e8252d3fc3e5e6bb879f029b1 upstream.

0x7d and 0x7e bytes are meant to be escaped in the data portion of
frames, but this didn't occur since next_chunk_len() had an off-by-one
error. That also resulted in the final byte of a payload being written
as a separate tty write op.

The chunk prior to an escaped byte would be one byte short, and the
next call would never test the txpos+1 case, which is where the escaped
byte was located. That meant it never hit the escaping case in
mctp_serial_tx_work().

Example Input: 01 00 08 c8 7e 80 02

Previous incorrect chunks from next_chunk_len():

01 00 08
c8 7e 80
02

With this fix:

01 00 08 c8
7e
80 02

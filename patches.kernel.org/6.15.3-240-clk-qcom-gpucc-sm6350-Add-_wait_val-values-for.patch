Subject: [PATCH] clk: qcom: gpucc-sm6350: Add *_wait_val values for GDSCs
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.3
Git-commit: d988b0b866c2aeb23aa74022b5bbd463165a7a33

[ Upstream commit d988b0b866c2aeb23aa74022b5bbd463165a7a33 ]

Compared to the msm-4.19 driver the mainline GDSC driver always sets the
bits for en_rest, en_few & clk_dis, and if those values are not set
per-GDSC in the respective driver then the default value from the GDSC
driver is used. The downstream driver only conditionally sets
clk_dis_wait_val if qcom,clk-dis-wait-val is given in devicetree.

Correct this situation by explicitly setting those values. For all GDSCs
the reset value of those bits are used, with the exception of
gpu_cx_gdsc which has an explicit value (qcom,clk-dis-wait-val = <8>).

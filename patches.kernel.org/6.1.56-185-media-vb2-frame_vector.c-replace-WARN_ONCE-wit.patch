Subject: [PATCH] media: vb2: frame_vector.c: replace WARN_ONCE with a comment
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.56
Git-commit: 735de5caf79e06cc9fb96b1b4f4974674ae3e917

[ Upstream commit 735de5caf79e06cc9fb96b1b4f4974674ae3e917 ]

The WARN_ONCE was issued also in cases that had nothing to do with VM_IO
(e.g. if the start address was just a random value and uaccess fails with
-EFAULT).

There are no reports of WARN_ONCE being issued for actual VM_IO cases, so
just drop it and instead add a note to the comment before the function.

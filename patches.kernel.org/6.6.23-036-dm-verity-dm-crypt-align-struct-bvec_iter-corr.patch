Subject: [PATCH] dm-verity, dm-crypt: align "struct bvec_iter" correctly
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.23
Git-commit: 787f1b2800464aa277236a66eb3c279535edd460

[ Upstream commit 787f1b2800464aa277236a66eb3c279535edd460 ]

"struct bvec_iter" is defined with the __packed attribute, so it is
aligned on a single byte. On X86 (and on other architectures that support
unaligned addresses in hardware), "struct bvec_iter" is accessed using the
8-byte and 4-byte memory instructions, however these instructions are less
efficient if they operate on unaligned addresses.

(on RISC machines that don't have unaligned access in hardware, GCC
generates byte-by-byte accesses that are very inefficient - see [1])

This commit reorders the entries in "struct dm_verity_io" and "struct
convert_context", so that "struct bvec_iter" is aligned on 8 bytes.

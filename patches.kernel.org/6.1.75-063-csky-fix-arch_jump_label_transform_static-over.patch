Subject: [PATCH] csky: fix arch_jump_label_transform_static override
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.75
Git-commit: ca8e45c8048a2c9503c74751d25414601f730580

[ Upstream commit ca8e45c8048a2c9503c74751d25414601f730580 ]

The arch_jump_label_transform_static() function in csky was originally meant to
override the generic __weak function, but that got changed to an #ifndef check.

This showed up as a missing-prototype warning:
arch/csky/kernel/jump_label.c:43:6: error: no previous prototype for 'arch_jump_label_transform_static' [-Werror=missing-prototypes]

Change the method to use the new method of having a #define and a prototype
for the global function.

Fixes: 7e6b9db27de9 ("jump_label: make initial NOP patching the special case")
Fixes: 4e8bb4ba5a55 ("csky: Add jump-label implementation")

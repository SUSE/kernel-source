Subject: [PATCH] mfd: tps65219: Update TPS65214 MFD cell's GPIO compatible
 string
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.1
Git-commit: 6f27d26e363a41fc651be852094823ce47a43243

[ Upstream commit 6f27d26e363a41fc651be852094823ce47a43243 ]

This patch reflects the change made to move TPS65215 from 1 GPO and 1 GPIO
to 2 GPOs and 1 GPIO. TPS65215 and TPS65219 both have 2 GPOs and 1 GPIO.
TPS65214 has 1 GPO and 1 GPIO. TPS65215 will reuse the TPS65219 GPIO
compatible string.

Subject: [PATCH] libbpf: detect broken PID filtering logic for multi-uprobe
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.9
Git-commit: 04d939a2ab229a3821f04fc81f7c027842f501f1

[ Upstream commit 04d939a2ab229a3821f04fc81f7c027842f501f1 ]

Libbpf is automatically (and transparently to user) detecting
multi-uprobe support in the kernel, and, if supported, uses
multi-uprobes to improve USDT attachment speed.

USDTs can be attached system-wide or for the specific process by PID. In
the latter case, we rely on correct kernel logic of not triggering USDT
for unrelated processes.

As such, on older kernels that do support multi-uprobes, but still have
broken PID filtering logic, we need to fall back to singular uprobes.

Unfortunately, whether user is using PID filtering or not is known at
the attachment time, which happens after relevant BPF programs were
loaded into the kernel. Also unfortunately, we need to make a call
whether to use multi-uprobes or singular uprobe for SEC("usdt") programs
during BPF object load time, at which point we have no information about
possible PID filtering.

The distinction between single and multi-uprobes is small, but important
for the kernel. Multi-uprobes get BPF_TRACE_UPROBE_MULTI attach type,
and kernel internally substitiute different implementation of some of
BPF helpers (e.g., bpf_get_attach_cookie()) depending on whether uprobe
is multi or singular. So, multi-uprobes and singular uprobes cannot be
intermixed.

All the above implies that we have to make an early and conservative
call about the use of multi-uprobes. And so this patch modifies libbpf's
existing feature detector for multi-uprobe support to also check correct
PID filtering. If PID filtering is not yet fixed, we fall back to
singular uprobes for USDTs.

This extension to feature detection is simple thanks to kernel's -EINVAL
addition for pid < 0.

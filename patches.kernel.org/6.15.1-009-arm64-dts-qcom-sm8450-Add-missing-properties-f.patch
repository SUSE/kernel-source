Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: Add missing properties for
 cryptobam
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.1
Git-commit: 0fe6357229cb15a64b6413c62f1c3d4de68ce55f

commit 0fe6357229cb15a64b6413c62f1c3d4de68ce55f upstream.

num-channels and qcom,num-ees are required for BAM nodes without clock,
because the driver cannot ensure the hardware is powered on when trying to
obtain the information from the hardware registers. Specifying the node
without these properties is unsafe and has caused early boot crashes for
other SoCs before [1, 2].

Add the missing information from the hardware registers to ensure the
driver can probe successfully without causing crashes.

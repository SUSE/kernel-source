Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Retry fault if vma_lookup() results become
 invalid
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.10
Git-commit: 13ec9308a85702af7c31f3638a2720863848a7f2

commit 13ec9308a85702af7c31f3638a2720863848a7f2 upstream.

Read mmu_invalidate_seq before dropping the mmap_lock so that KVM can
detect if the results of vma_lookup() (e.g. vma_shift) become stale
before it acquires kvm->mmu_lock. This fixes a theoretical bug where a
VMA could be changed by userspace after vma_lookup() and before KVM
reads the mmu_invalidate_seq, causing KVM to install page table entries
based on a (possibly) no-longer-valid vma_shift.

Re-order the MMU cache top-up to earlier in user_mem_abort() so that it
is not done after KVM has read mmu_invalidate_seq (i.e. so as to avoid
inducing spurious fault retries).

This bug has existed since KVM/ARM's inception. It's unlikely that any
sane userspace currently modifies VMAs in such a way as to trigger this
race. And even with directed testing I was unable to reproduce it. But a
sufficiently motivated host userspace might be able to exploit this
race.

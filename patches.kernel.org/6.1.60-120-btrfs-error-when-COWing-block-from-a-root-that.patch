Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: error when COWing block from a root that is being
 deleted
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.60
Git-commit: a2caab29884397e583d09be6546259a83ebfbdb1

[ Upstream commit a2caab29884397e583d09be6546259a83ebfbdb1 ]

At btrfs_cow_block() we check if the block being COWed belongs to a root
that is being deleted and if so we log an error message. However this is
an unexpected case and it indicates a bug somewhere, so we should return
an error and abort the transaction. So change this in the following ways:

1) Abort the transaction with -EUCLEAN, so that if the issue ever happens
   it can easily be noticed;

2) Change the logged message level from error to critical, and change the
   message itself to print the block's logical address and the ID of the
   root;

3) Return -EUCLEAN to the caller;

4) As this is an unexpected scenario, that should never happen, mark the
   check as unlikely, allowing the compiler to potentially generate better
   code.

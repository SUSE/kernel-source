Subject: [PATCH] tracefs: Add d_delete to remove negative dentries
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.43
Git-commit: d9b13cdad80dc11d74408cf201939a946e9303a6

[ Upstream commit d9b13cdad80dc11d74408cf201939a946e9303a6 ]

If a lookup in tracefs is done on a file that does not exist, it leaves a
dentry hanging around until memory pressure removes it. But eventfs
dentries should hang around as when their ref count goes to zero, it
requires more work to recreate it. For the rest of the tracefs dentries,
they hang around as their dentry is used as a descriptor for the tracing
system. But if a file lookup happens for a file in tracefs that does not
exist, it should be deleted.

Add a .d_delete callback that checks if dentry->fsdata is set or not. Only
eventfs dentries set fsdata so if it has content it should not be deleted
and should hang around in the cache.

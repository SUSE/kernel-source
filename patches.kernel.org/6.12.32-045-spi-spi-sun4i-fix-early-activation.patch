Subject: [PATCH] spi: spi-sun4i: fix early activation
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.32
Git-commit: fb98bd0a13de2c9d96cb5c00c81b5ca118ac9d71

[ Upstream commit fb98bd0a13de2c9d96cb5c00c81b5ca118ac9d71 ]

The SPI interface is activated before the CPOL setting is applied. In
that moment, the clock idles high and CS goes low. After a short delay,
CPOL and other settings are applied, which may cause the clock to change
state and idle low. This transition is not part of a clock cycle, and it
can confuse the receiving device.

To prevent this unexpected transition, activate the interface while CPOL
and the other settings are being applied.

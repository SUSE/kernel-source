Subject: [PATCH] net: mana: Record doorbell physical address in PF mode
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.39
Git-commit: e0fca6f2cebff539e9317a15a37dcf432e3b851a

[ Upstream commit e0fca6f2cebff539e9317a15a37dcf432e3b851a ]

MANA supports RDMA in PF mode. The driver should record the doorbell
physical address when in PF mode.

The doorbell physical address is used by the RDMA driver to map
doorbell pages of the device to user-mode applications through RDMA
verbs interface. In the past, they have been mapped to user-mode while
the device is in VF mode. With the support for PF mode implemented,
also expose those pages in PF mode.

Support for PF mode is implemented in
290e5d3c49f6 ("net: mana: Add support for Multi Vports on Bare metal")

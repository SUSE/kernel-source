References: bsc#1012628

[ Upstream commit 0161bd38c24312853ed5ae9a425a1c41c4ac674a ]

On powerpc64 as shown below by readelf, vDSO functions symbols have
type NOTYPE.

$ powerpc64-linux-gnu-readelf -a arch/powerpc/kernel/vdso/vdso64.so.dbg

    47: 0000000000000524    84 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT    8 __kernel_clock_getres

To overcome that, commit ba83b3239e65 ("selftests: vDSO: fix vDSO
symbols lookup for powerpc64") was applied to have selftests also
look for NOTYPE symbols, but the correct fix should be to flag VDSO
entry points as functions.

The original commit that brought VDSO support into powerpc/64 has the
following explanation:

    Note that the symbols exposed by the vDSO aren't "normal" function symbols, apps
    can't be expected to link against them directly, the vDSO's are both seen
    as if they were linked at 0 and the symbols just contain offsets to the
    various functions.  This is done on purpose to avoid a relocation step
    (ppc64 functions normally have descriptors with abs addresses in them).
    When glibc uses those functions, it's expected to use it's own trampolines
    that know how to reach them.

The descriptors it's talking about are the OPD function descriptors
used on ABI v1 (big endian). But it would be more correct for a text
symbol to have type function, even if there's no function descriptor
for it.

glibc has a special case already for handling the VDSO symbols which
creates a fake opd pointing at the kernel symbol. So changing the VDSO
symbol type to function shouldn't affect that.

For ABI v2, there is no function descriptors and VDSO functions can
safely have function type.

So lets flag VDSO entry points as functions and revert the
selftest change.

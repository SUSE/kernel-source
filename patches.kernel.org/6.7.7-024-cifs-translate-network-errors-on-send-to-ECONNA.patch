Subject: [PATCH] cifs: translate network errors on send to -ECONNABORTED
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: a68106a6928e0a6680f12bcc7338c0dddcfe4d11

[ Upstream commit a68106a6928e0a6680f12bcc7338c0dddcfe4d11 ]

When the network stack returns various errors, we today bubble
up the error to the user (in case of soft mounts).

This change translates all network errors except -EINTR and
-EAGAIN to -ECONNABORTED. A similar approach is taken when
we receive network errors when reading from the socket.

The change also forces the cifsd thread to reconnect during
it's next activity.

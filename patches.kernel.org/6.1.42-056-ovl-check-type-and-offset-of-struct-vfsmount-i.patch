Subject: [PATCH] ovl: check type and offset of struct vfsmount in ovl_entry
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.42
Git-commit: f723edb8a532cd26e1ff0a2b271d73762d48f762

[ Upstream commit f723edb8a532cd26e1ff0a2b271d73762d48f762 ]

Porting overlayfs to the new amount api I started experiencing random
crashes that couldn't be explained easily. So after much debugging and
reasoning it became clear that struct ovl_entry requires the point to
struct vfsmount to be the first member and of type struct vfsmount.

During the port I added a new member at the beginning of struct
ovl_entry which broke all over the place in the form of random crashes
and cache corruptions. While there's a comment in ovl_free_fs() to the
effect of "Hack! Reuse ofs->layers as a vfsmount array before freeing
it" there's no such comment on struct ovl_entry which makes this easy to
trip over.

Add a comment and two static asserts for both the offset and the type of
pointer in struct ovl_entry.

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "eventfs: Do not allow NULL parent to
 eventfs_start_creating()"
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.18
Git-commit: 6fdc0bcd066d7832faff8a61f335aed10a6f9f84

This reverts commit 6abb8c223ce12078a0f2c129656a13338dfe960b.

The eventfs was not designed properly and may have some hidden bugs in it.
Linus rewrote it properly and I trust his version more than this one. Revert
the backported patches for 6.6 and re-apply all the changes to make it
equivalent to Linus's version.

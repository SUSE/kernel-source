Subject: [PATCH] rust: alloc: add `Allocator` trait
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.19
Git-commit: b7a084ba4fbb8f416ce8d19c93a3a2bee63c9c89

commit b7a084ba4fbb8f416ce8d19c93a3a2bee63c9c89 upstream.

Add a kernel specific `Allocator` trait, that in contrast to the one in
Rust's core library doesn't require unstable features and supports GFP
flags.

Subsequent patches add the following trait implementors: `Kmalloc`,
`Vmalloc` and `KVmalloc`.

+/// The kernel's [`Allocator`] trait.
+///
+/// An implementation of [`Allocator`] can allocate, re-allocate and free memory buffers described
+/// via [`Layout`].
+///
+/// [`Allocator`] is designed to be implemented as a ZST; [`Allocator`] functions do not operate on
+/// an object instance.
+///
+/// In order to be able to support `#[derive(SmartPointer)]` later on, we need to avoid a design
+/// that requires an `Allocator` to be instantiated, hence its functions must not contain any kind
+/// of `self` parameter.
+///
+/// # Safety
+///
+/// - A memory allocation returned from an allocator must remain valid until it is explicitly freed.
+///
+/// - Any pointer to a valid memory allocation must be valid to be passed to any other [`Allocator`]
+///   function of the same type.
+///
+/// - Implementers must ensure that all trait functions abide by the guarantees documented in the
+///   `# Guarantees` sections.

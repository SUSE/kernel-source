Subject: [PATCH] block: fix 'kmem_cache of name 'bio-108' already exists'
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.8
Git-commit: b654f7a51ffb386131de42aa98ed831f8c126546

[ Upstream commit b654f7a51ffb386131de42aa98ed831f8c126546 ]

Device mapper bioset often has big bio_slab size, which can be more than
1000, then 8byte can't hold the slab name any more, cause the kmem_cache
allocation warning of 'kmem_cache of name 'bio-108' already exists'.

Fix the warning by extending bio_slab->name to 12 bytes, but fix output
of /proc/slabinfo

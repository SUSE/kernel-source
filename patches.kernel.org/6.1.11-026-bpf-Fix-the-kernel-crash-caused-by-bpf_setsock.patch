Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Fix the kernel crash caused by bpf_setsockopt().
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.11
Git-commit: 5416c9aea8323583e8696f0500b6142dfae80821

[ Upstream commit 5416c9aea8323583e8696f0500b6142dfae80821 ]

The kernel crash was caused by a BPF program attached to the
"lsm_cgroup/socket_sock_rcv_skb" hook, which performed a call to
`bpf_setsockopt()` in order to set the TCP_NODELAY flag as an
example. Flags like TCP_NODELAY can prompt the kernel to flush a
socket's outgoing queue, and this hook
"lsm_cgroup/socket_sock_rcv_skb" is frequently triggered by
softirqs. The issue was that in certain circumstances, when
`tcp_write_xmit()` was called to flush the queue, it would also allow
BH (bottom-half) to run. This could lead to our program attempting to
flush the same socket recursively, which caused a `skbuff` to be
unlinked twice.

`security_sock_rcv_skb()` is triggered by `tcp_filter()`. This occurs
before the sock ownership is checked in `tcp_v4_rcv()`. Consequently,
if a bpf program runs on `security_sock_rcv_skb()` while under softirq
conditions, it may not possess the lock needed for `bpf_setsockopt()`,
thus presenting an issue.

The patch fixes this issue by ensuring that a BPF program attached to
the "lsm_cgroup/socket_sock_rcv_skb" hook is not allowed to call
`bpf_setsockopt()`.

The differences from v1 are
 - changing commit log to explain holding the lock of the sock,
 - emphasizing that TCP_NODELAY is not the only flag, and
 - adding the fixes tag.

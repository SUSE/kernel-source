Subject: [PATCH] riscv/purgatory: align riscv_kernel_entry
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.4
Git-commit: fb197c5d2fd24b9af3d4697d0cf778645846d6d5

[ Upstream commit fb197c5d2fd24b9af3d4697d0cf778645846d6d5 ]

When alignment handling is delegated to the kernel, everything must be
word-aligned in purgatory, since the trap handler is then set to the
kexec one. Without the alignment, hitting the exception would
ultimately crash. On other occasions, the kernel's handler would take
care of exceptions.
This has been tested on a JH7110 SoC with oreboot and its SBI delegating
unaligned access exceptions and the kernel configured to handle them.

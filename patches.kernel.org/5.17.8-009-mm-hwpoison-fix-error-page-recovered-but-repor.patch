Subject: [PATCH] mm/hwpoison: fix error page recovered but reported "not
 recovered"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.8
Git-commit: 046545a661af2beec21de7b90ca0e35f05088a81

commit 046545a661af2beec21de7b90ca0e35f05088a81 upstream.

When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the
CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a
UCNA signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check
when the data is about to be consumed.

If the CMCI wins that race, the page is marked poisoned when
uc_decode_notifier() calls memory_failure() and the machine check
processing code finds the page already poisoned.  It calls
kill_accessing_process() to make sure a SIGBUS is sent.  But returns the
wrong error code.

Console log looks like this:

  mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at 3710b3400
  Memory failure: 0x3710b3: recovery action for dirty LRU page: Recovered
  Memory failure: 0x3710b3: already hardware poisoned
  Memory failure: 0x3710b3: Sending SIGBUS to einj_mem_uc:361438 due to hardware memory corruption
  mce: Memory error not recovered

kill_accessing_process() is supposed to return -EHWPOISON to notify that
SIGBUS is already set to the process and kill_me_maybe() doesn't have to
send it again.  But current code simply fails to do this, so fix it to
make sure to work as intended.  This change avoids the noise message
"Memory error not recovered" and skips duplicate SIGBUSs.

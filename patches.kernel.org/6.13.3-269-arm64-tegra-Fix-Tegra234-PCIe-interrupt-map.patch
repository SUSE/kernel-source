Subject: [PATCH] arm64: tegra: Fix Tegra234 PCIe interrupt-map
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.3
Git-commit: b615fbd70fce8582d92b3bdbbf3c9b80cadcfb55

commit b615fbd70fce8582d92b3bdbbf3c9b80cadcfb55 upstream.

For interrupt-map entries, the DTS specification requires
that #address-cells is defined for both the child node and the
interrupt parent.  For the PCIe interrupt-map entries, the parent
node ("gic") has not specified #address-cells. The existing layout
of the PCIe interrupt-map entries indicates that it assumes
that #address-cells is zero for this node.

Explicitly set #address-cells to zero for "gic" so that it complies
with the device tree specification.

NVIDIA EDK2 works around this issue by assuming #address-cells
is zero in this scenario, but that workaround is being removed and so
this update is needed or else NVIDIA EDK2 cannot successfully parse the
device tree and the board cannot boot.

Subject: [PATCH] ata: ahci: Disallow LPM for ASUSPRO-D840SA motherboard
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.4
Git-commit: b5acc3628898baa63658bc4125f9525f9b3dd4f3

commit b5acc3628898baa63658bc4125f9525f9b3dd4f3 upstream.

A user has bisected a regression which causes graphical corruptions on his
screen to commit 7627a0edef54 ("ata: ahci: Drop low power policy board
type").

Simply reverting commit 7627a0edef54 ("ata: ahci: Drop low power policy
board type") makes the graphical corruptions on his screen to go away.
(Note: there are no visible messages in dmesg that indicates a problem
with AHCI.)

The user also reports that the problem occurs regardless if there is an
HDD or an SSD connected via AHCI, so the problem is not device related.

The devices also work fine on other motherboards, so it seems specific to
the ASUSPRO-D840SA motherboard.

While enabling low power modes for AHCI is not supposed to affect
completely unrelated hardware, like a graphics card, it does however
allow the system to enter deeper PC-states, which could expose ACPI issues
that were previously not visible (because the system never entered these
lower power states before).

There are previous examples where enabling LPM exposed serious BIOS/ACPI
bugs, see e.g. commit 240630e61870 ("ahci: Disable LPM on Lenovo 50 series
laptops with a too old BIOS").

Since there hasn't been any BIOS update in years for the ASUSPRO-D840SA
motherboard, disable LPM for this board, in order to avoid entering lower
PC-states, which triggers graphical corruptions.

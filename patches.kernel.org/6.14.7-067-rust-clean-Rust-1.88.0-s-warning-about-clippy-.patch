Subject: [PATCH] rust: clean Rust 1.88.0's warning about
 `clippy::disallowed_macros` configuration
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.7
Git-commit: c016722fd57551f8a6fcf472c9d2bcf2130ea0ec

commit c016722fd57551f8a6fcf472c9d2bcf2130ea0ec upstream.

Starting with Rust 1.88.0 (expected 2025-06-26) [1], Clippy may start
warning about paths that do not resolve in the `disallowed_macros`
configuration:

    warning: `kernel::dbg` does not refer to an existing macro
      --> .clippy.toml:10:5
       |
    10 |     { path = "kernel::dbg", reason = "the `dbg!` macro is intended as a debugging tool" },
       |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a lint we requested at [2], due to the trouble debugging
the lint due to false negatives (e.g. [3]), which we use to emulate
`clippy::dbg_macro` [4]. See commit 8577c9dca799 ("rust: replace
`clippy::dbg_macro` with `disallowed_macros`") for more details.

Given the false negatives are not resolved yet, it is expected that
Clippy complains about not finding this macro.

Thus, until the false negatives are fixed (and, even then, probably we
will need to wait for the MSRV to raise enough), use the escape hatch
to allow an invalid path.

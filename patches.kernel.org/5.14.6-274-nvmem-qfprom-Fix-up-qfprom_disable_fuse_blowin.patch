Subject: [PATCH] nvmem: qfprom: Fix up qfprom_disable_fuse_blowing() ordering
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.6
Git-commit: 11c4b3e264d68ba6dcd52d12dbcfd3f564f2f137

[ Upstream commit 11c4b3e264d68ba6dcd52d12dbcfd3f564f2f137 ]

qfprom_disable_fuse_blowing() disables a bunch of resources,
and then does a few register writes in the 'conf' address
space.
It works perhaps because the resources are needed only for the
'raw' register space writes, and that the 'conf' space allows
read/writes regardless.
However that makes the code look confusing, so just move the
register writes before turning off the resources in the
function.

Subject: [PATCH] doc: mptcp: net.mptcp.pm_type is deprecated
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.8
Git-commit: 6f021e95d0828edc8ed104a294594c2f9569383a

commit 6f021e95d0828edc8ed104a294594c2f9569383a upstream.

The net.mptcp.pm_type sysctl knob has been deprecated in v6.15,
net.mptcp.path_manager should be used instead.

Adapt the section about path managers to suggest using the new sysctl
knob instead of the deprecated one.

Fixes: 595c26d122d1 ("mptcp: sysctl: set path manager by name")

Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: send: limit number of clones and allocated memory size
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.15
Git-commit: 33e17b3f5ab74af12aca58c515bc8424ff69a343

[ Upstream commit 33e17b3f5ab74af12aca58c515bc8424ff69a343 ]

The arg->clone_sources_count is u64 and can trigger a warning when a
huge value is passed from user space and a huge array is allocated.
Limit the allocated memory to 8MiB (can be increased if needed), which
in turn limits the number of clone sources to 8M / sizeof(struct
clone_root) = 8M / 40 = 209715.  Real world number of clones is from
tens to hundreds, so this is future proof.

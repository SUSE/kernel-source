Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: idxd: Protect int_handle field in hw descriptor
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.11
Git-commit: 778dfacc903d4b1ef5b7a9726e3a36bc15913d29

[ Upstream commit 778dfacc903d4b1ef5b7a9726e3a36bc15913d29 ]

The int_handle field in hw descriptor should also be protected
by wmb() before possibly triggering a DMA read.

[ Upstream commit 03cab65a07e083b6c1010fbc8f9b817e9aca75d9 ]

Don't use the test-specific header files as source files to force a
target dependency, as clang will complain if more than one source file
is used for a compile command with a single '-o' flag.

Use the proper Makefile variables instead as defined in
tools/testing/selftests/lib.mk.

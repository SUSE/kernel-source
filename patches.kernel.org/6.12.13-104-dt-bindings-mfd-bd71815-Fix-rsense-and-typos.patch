Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: mfd: bd71815: Fix rsense and typos
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.13
Git-commit: 6856edf7ead8c54803216a38a7b227bcb3dadff7

[ Upstream commit 6856edf7ead8c54803216a38a7b227bcb3dadff7 ]

The sense resistor used for measuring currents is typically some tens of
milli Ohms. It has accidentally been documented to be tens of mega Ohms.
Fix the size of this resistor and a few copy-paste errors while at it.

Drop the unsuitable 'rohm,charger-sense-resistor-ohms' property (which
can't represent resistors smaller than one Ohm), and introduce a new
'rohm,charger-sense-resistor-micro-ohms' property with appropriate
minimum, maximum and default values instead.

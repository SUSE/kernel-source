Subject: [PATCH] arm64/fpsimd: Avoid warning when sve_to_fpsimd() is unused
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.34
Git-commit: f699c66691fb7e08a5a631c5baf5f2a19b7a6468

[ Upstream commit f699c66691fb7e08a5a631c5baf5f2a19b7a6468 ]

Historically fpsimd_to_sve() and sve_to_fpsimd() were (conditionally)
called by functions which were defined regardless of CONFIG_ARM64_SVE.
Hence it was necessary that both fpsimd_to_sve() and sve_to_fpsimd()
were always defined and not guarded by ifdeffery.

As a result of the removal of fpsimd_signal_preserve_current_state() in
commit:

  929fa99b1215966f ("arm64/fpsimd: signal: Always save+flush state early")

... sve_to_fpsimd() has no callers when CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=n, resulting in
a build-time warnign that it is unused:

| arch/arm64/kernel/fpsimd.c:676:13: warning: unused function 'sve_to_fpsimd' [-Wunused-function]
|   676 | static void sve_to_fpsimd(struct task_struct *task)
|       |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
| 1 warning generated.

In contrast, fpsimd_to_sve() still has callers which are defined when
CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=n, and it would be awkward to hide this behind
ifdeffery and/or to use stub functions.

For now, suppress the warning by marking both fpsimd_to_sve() and
sve_to_fpsimd() as 'static inline', as we usually do for stub functions.
The compiler will no longer warn if either function is unused.

Aside from suppressing the warning, there should be no functional change
as a result of this patch.

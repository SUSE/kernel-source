Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: verdin-imx8mm: add otg2 pd to usbphy
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.9
Git-commit: 2fa24aa721ebb3a83dd2093814ba9a5dcdaa3183

[ Upstream commit 2fa24aa721ebb3a83dd2093814ba9a5dcdaa3183 ]

The Verdin iMX8M Mini System on Module does not have USB-ID signal
connected on Verdin USB_2 (usbotg2). On Verdin Development board this is
no problem, as we have connected a USB-Hub that is always connected.

However, if Verdin USB_2 is desired to be used as a single USB-Host port
the chipidea driver does not detect if a USB device is plugged into this
port, due to runtime pm shutting down the PHY.

Add the power-domain &pgc_otg2 to &usbphynop2 in order to detect
plugging events and enumerate the usb device.

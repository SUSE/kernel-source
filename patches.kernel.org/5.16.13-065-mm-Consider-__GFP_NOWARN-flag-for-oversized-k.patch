commit 0708a0afe291bdfe1386d74d5ec1f0c27e8b9168 upstream.

syzkaller was recently triggering an oversized kvmalloc() warning via
xdp_umem_create().

The triggered warning was added back in 7661809d493b ("mm: don't allow
oversized kvmalloc() calls"). The rationale for the warning for huge
kvmalloc sizes was as a reaction to a security bug where the size was
more than UINT_MAX but not everything was prepared to handle unsigned
long sizes.

Anyway, the AF_XDP related call trace from this syzkaller report was:

Björn mentioned that requests for >2GB allocation can still be valid:

  The structure that is being allocated is the page-pinning accounting.
  AF_XDP has an internal limit of U32_MAX pages, which is *a lot*, but
  still fewer than what memcg allows (PAGE_COUNTER_MAX is a LONG_MAX/
  PAGE_SIZE on 64 bit systems). [...]

  I could just change from U32_MAX to INT_MAX, but as I stated earlier
  that has a hacky feeling to it. [...] From my perspective, the code
  isn't broken, with the memcg limits in consideration. [...]

Linus says:

  [...] Pretty much every time this has come up, the kernel warning has
  shown that yes, the code was broken and there really wasn't a reason
  for doing allocations that big.

  Of course, some people would be perfectly fine with the allocation
  failing, they just don't want the warning. I didn't want __GFP_NOWARN
  to shut it up originally because I wanted people to see all those
  cases, but these days I think we can just say "yeah, people can shut
  it up explicitly by saying 'go ahead and fail this allocation, don't
  warn about it'".

  So enough time has passed that by now I'd certainly be ok with [it].

Thus allow call-sites to silence such userspace triggered splats if the
allocation requests have __GFP_NOWARN. For xdp_umem_pin_pages()'s call
to kvcalloc() this is already the case, so nothing else needed there.

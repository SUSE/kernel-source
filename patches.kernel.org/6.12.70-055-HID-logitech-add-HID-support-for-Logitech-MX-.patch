Subject: [PATCH] HID: logitech: add HID++ support for Logitech MX Anywhere 3S
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.70
Git-commit: d7f6629bffdcb962d383ef8c9a30afef81e997fe

[ Upstream commit d7f6629bffdcb962d383ef8c9a30afef81e997fe ]

I've acquired a Logitech MX Anywhere 3S mouse, which supports HID++ over
Bluetooth. Adding its PID 0xb037 to the allowlist enables the additional
features, such as high-resolution scrolling. Tested working across multiple
machines, with a mix of Intel and Mediatek Bluetooth chips.

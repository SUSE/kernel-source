Subject: [PATCH] Revert "vmgenid: emit uevent when VMGENID updates"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.8
Git-commit: 3aadf100f93d80815685493d60cd8cab206403df

commit 3aadf100f93d80815685493d60cd8cab206403df upstream.

This reverts commit ad6bcdad2b6724e113f191a12f859a9e8456b26d. I had
nak'd it, and Greg said on the thread that it links that he wasn't going
to take it either, especially since it's not his code or his tree, but
then, seemingly accidentally, it got pushed up some months later, in
what looks like a mistake, with no further discussion in the linked
thread. So revert it, since it's clearly not intended.

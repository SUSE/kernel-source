Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp: correct SPMI bus address cells
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.3
Git-commit: 76d9e8b4d54ae2cb91a68f0cb82624887de767a7

[ Upstream commit 76d9e8b4d54ae2cb91a68f0cb82624887de767a7 ]

The SPMI bus uses two address cells and zero size cells (second reg
entry - SPMI_USID - is not the size):

  spmi@c440000: #address-cells:0:0: 2 was expected

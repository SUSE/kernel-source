Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Fix typo in pronto remoteproc node
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 5458d6f2827cd30218570f266b8d238417461f2f

[ Upstream commit 5458d6f2827cd30218570f266b8d238417461f2f ]

The smem-state properties for the pronto node were incorrectly labelled,
reading `qcom,state*` rather than `qcom,smem-state*`. Fix that, allowing
the stop state to be used.

Subject: [PATCH] selftests/mm: fix incorrect buffer->mirror size in hmm2
 double_map test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

commit 76503e1fa1a53ef041a120825d5ce81c7fe7bdd7 upstream.

The hmm2 double_map test was failing due to an incorrect buffer->mirror
size.  The buffer->mirror size was 6, while buffer->ptr size was 6 *
PAGE_SIZE.  The test failed because the kernel's copy_to_user function was
attempting to copy a 6 * PAGE_SIZE buffer to buffer->mirror.  Since the
size of buffer->mirror was incorrect, copy_to_user failed.

This patch corrects the buffer->mirror size to 6 * PAGE_SIZE.

Test Result without this patch

Test Result with this patch

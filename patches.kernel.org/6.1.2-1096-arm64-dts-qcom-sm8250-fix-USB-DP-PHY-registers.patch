Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: fix USB-DP PHY registers
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: f8d8840c72b3df61b5252052b79020dabec01ab5

commit f8d8840c72b3df61b5252052b79020dabec01ab5 upstream.

When adding support for the DisplayPort part of the QMP PHY the binding
(and devicetree parser) for the (USB) child node was simply reused and
this has lead to some confusion.

The third DP register region is really the DP_PHY region, not "PCS" as
the binding claims, and lie at offset 0x2a00 (not 0x2c00).

Similarly, there likely are no "RX", "RX2" or "PCS_MISC" regions as
there are for the USB part of the PHY (and in any case the Linux driver
does not use them).

Note that the sixth "PCS_MISC" region is not even in the binding.

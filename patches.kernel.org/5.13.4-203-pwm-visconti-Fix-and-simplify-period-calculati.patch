Subject: [PATCH] pwm: visconti: Fix and simplify period calculation

[ Upstream commit 937efa29e70f7f8424b74631375dcb35d82a4614 ]

With the original code a request for period = 65536000 ns and period =
32768000 ns yields the same register settings (which results in 32768000
ns) because the value for pwmc0 was miscalculated.

Also simplify using that fls(0) is 0.

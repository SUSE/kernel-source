Subject: [PATCH] ext4: don't set EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_CONVERT when splitting before
 submitting I/O
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: feaf2a80e78f89ee8a3464126077ba8683b62791

commit feaf2a80e78f89ee8a3464126077ba8683b62791 upstream.

When allocating blocks during within-EOF DIO and writeback with
dioread_nolock enabled, EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_PRE_IO was set to split an
existing large unwritten extent. However, EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_CONVERT was
set when calling ext4_split_convert_extents(), which may potentially
result in stale data issues.

Assume we have an unwritten extent, and then DIO writes the second half.

   [UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU] on-disk extent        U: unwritten extent
   [UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU] extent status tree
            |<-   ->| ----> dio write this range

First, ext4_iomap_alloc() call ext4_map_blocks() with
EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_PRE_IO, EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_UNWRIT_EXT and
EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_CREATE flags set. ext4_map_blocks() find this extent and
call ext4_split_convert_extents() with EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_CONVERT and the
above flags set.

Then, ext4_split_convert_extents() calls ext4_split_extent() with
EXT4_EXT_MAY_ZEROOUT, EXT4_EXT_MARK_UNWRIT2 and EXT4_EXT_DATA_VALID2
flags set, and it calls ext4_split_extent_at() to split the second half
with EXT4_EXT_DATA_VALID2, EXT4_EXT_MARK_UNWRIT1, EXT4_EXT_MAY_ZEROOUT
and EXT4_EXT_MARK_UNWRIT2 flags set. However, ext4_split_extent_at()
failed to insert extent since a temporary lack -ENOSPC. It zeroes out
the first half but convert the entire on-disk extent to written since
the EXT4_EXT_DATA_VALID2 flag set, but left the second half as unwritten
in the extent status tree.

   [0000000000SSSSSS]  data                S: stale data, 0: zeroed
   [WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW]  on-disk extent      W: written extent
   [WWWWWWWWWWUUUUUU]  extent status tree

Finally, if the DIO failed to write data to the disk, the stale data in
the second half will be exposed once the cached extent entry is gone.

Fix this issue by not passing EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_CONVERT when splitting
an unwritten extent before submitting I/O, and make
ext4_split_convert_extents() to zero out the entire extent range
to zero for this case, and also mark the extent in the extent status
tree for consistency.

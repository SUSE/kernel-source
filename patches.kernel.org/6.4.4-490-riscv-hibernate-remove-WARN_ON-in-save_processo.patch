Subject: [PATCH] riscv: hibernate: remove WARN_ON in save_processor_state
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.4
Git-commit: 91afbaafd6b1f1846520efd2b158066a25a1a316

[ Upstream commit 91afbaafd6b1f1846520efd2b158066a25a1a316 ]

During hibernation or restoration, freeze_secondary_cpus
checks num_online_cpus via BUG_ON, and the subsequent
save_processor_state also does the checking with WARN_ON.

In the case of CONFIG_PM_SLEEP_SMP=n, freeze_secondary_cpus
is not defined, but the sole possible condition to disable
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP_SMP is !SMP where num_online_cpus is always 1.
We also don't have to check it in save_processor_state.

So remove the unnecessary checking in save_processor_state.

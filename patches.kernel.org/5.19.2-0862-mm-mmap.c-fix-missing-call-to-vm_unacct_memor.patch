Subject: [PATCH] mm/mmap.c: fix missing call to vm_unacct_memory in
 mmap_region
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 7f82f922319ede486540e8746769865b9508d2c2

[ Upstream commit 7f82f922319ede486540e8746769865b9508d2c2 ]

Since the beginning, charged is set to 0 to avoid calling vm_unacct_memory
twice because vm_unacct_memory will be called by above unmap_region.  But
since commit 4f74d2c8e827 ("vm: remove 'nr_accounted' calculations from
the unmap_vmas() interfaces"), unmap_region doesn't call vm_unacct_memory
anymore.  So charged shouldn't be set to 0 now otherwise the calling to
paired vm_unacct_memory will be missed and leads to imbalanced account.

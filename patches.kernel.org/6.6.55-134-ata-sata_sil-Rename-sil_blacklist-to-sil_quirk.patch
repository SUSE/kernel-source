Subject: [PATCH] ata: sata_sil: Rename sil_blacklist to sil_quirks
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.55
Git-commit: 93b0f9e11ce511353c65b7f924cf5f95bd9c3aba

[ Upstream commit 93b0f9e11ce511353c65b7f924cf5f95bd9c3aba ]

Rename the array sil_blacklist to sil_quirks as this name is more
neutral and is also consistent with how this driver define quirks with
the SIL_QUIRK_XXX flags.

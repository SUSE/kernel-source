Subject: [PATCH] bpf: bpf_sk_storage: Fix the missing uncharge in
 sk_omem_alloc
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.5.4
Git-commit: 55d49f750b1cb1f177fb1b00ae02cba4613bcfb7

[ Upstream commit 55d49f750b1cb1f177fb1b00ae02cba4613bcfb7 ]

The commit c83597fa5dc6 ("bpf: Refactor some inode/task/sk storage functions
for reuse"), refactored the bpf_{sk,task,inode}_storage_free() into
bpf_local_storage_unlink_nolock() which then later renamed to
bpf_local_storage_destroy(). The commit accidentally passed the
"bool uncharge_mem = false" argument to bpf_selem_unlink_storage_nolock()
which then stopped the uncharge from happening to the sk->sk_omem_alloc.

This missing uncharge only happens when the sk is going away (during
__sk_destruct).

This patch fixes it by always passing "uncharge_mem = true". It is a
noop to the task/inode/cgroup storage because they do not have the
map_local_storage_(un)charge enabled in the map_ops. A followup patch
will be done in bpf-next to remove the uncharge_mem argument.

A selftest is added in the next patch.

Subject: [PATCH] net: pse-pd: Fix enabled status mismatch
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.4
Git-commit: dda3529d2e84e2ee7b97158c9cdf5e10308f37bc

[ Upstream commit dda3529d2e84e2ee7b97158c9cdf5e10308f37bc ]

PSE controllers like the TPS23881 can forcefully turn off their
configuration state. In such cases, the is_enabled() and get_status()
callbacks will report the PSE as disabled, while admin_state_enabled
will show it as enabled. This mismatch can lead the user to attempt
to enable it, but no action is taken as admin_state_enabled remains set.

The solution is to disable the PSE before enabling it, ensuring the
actual status matches admin_state_enabled.

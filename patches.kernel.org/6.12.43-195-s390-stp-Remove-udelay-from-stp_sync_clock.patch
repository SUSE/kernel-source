Subject: [PATCH] s390/stp: Remove udelay from stp_sync_clock()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.43
Git-commit: b367017cdac21781a74eff4e208d3d38e1f38d3f

[ Upstream commit b367017cdac21781a74eff4e208d3d38e1f38d3f ]

When an stp sync check is handled on a system with multiple
cpus each cpu gets a machine check but only the first one
actually handles the sync operation. All other CPUs spin
waiting for the first one to finish with a short udelay().
But udelay can't be used here as the first CPU modifies tod_clock_base
before performing the sync op. During this timeframe
get_tod_clock_monotonic() might return a non-monotonic time.

The time spent waiting should be very short and udelay is a busy loop
anyways, therefore simply remove the udelay.

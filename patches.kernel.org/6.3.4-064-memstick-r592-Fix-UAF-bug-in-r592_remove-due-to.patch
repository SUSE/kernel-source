Subject: [PATCH] memstick: r592: Fix UAF bug in r592_remove due to race
 condition
References: bsc#1012628 CVE-2023-3141 bsc#1212129 bsc#1211449
Patch-mainline: 6.3.4
Git-commit: 63264422785021704c39b38f65a78ab9e4a186d7

[ Upstream commit 63264422785021704c39b38f65a78ab9e4a186d7 ]

In r592_probe, dev->detect_timer was bound with r592_detect_timer.
In r592_irq function, the timer function will be invoked by mod_timer.

If we remove the module which will call hantro_release to make cleanup,
there may be a unfinished work. The possible sequence is as follows,
which will cause a typical UAF bug.

Fix it by canceling the work before cleanup in r592_remove.

CPU0                  CPU1

                    |r592_detect_timer
r592_remove         |
  memstick_free_host|
  put_device;       |
  kfree(host);      |
                    |
                    | queue_work
                    |   &host->media_checker //use

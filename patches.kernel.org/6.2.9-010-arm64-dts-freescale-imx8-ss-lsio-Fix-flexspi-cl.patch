Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: freescale: imx8-ss-lsio: Fix flexspi clock order
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.9
Git-commit: fd4334a06d452ce89a0bb831b03130c51331d927

[ Upstream commit fd4334a06d452ce89a0bb831b03130c51331d927 ]

The correct clock order is "fspi_en" and "fspi". As they are identical
just reordering the names is sufficient.

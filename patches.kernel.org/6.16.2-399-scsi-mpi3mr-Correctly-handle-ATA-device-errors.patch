Subject: [PATCH] scsi: mpi3mr: Correctly handle ATA device errors
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.2
Git-commit: 04caad5a7ba86e830d04750417a15bad8ac2613c

[ Upstream commit 04caad5a7ba86e830d04750417a15bad8ac2613c ]

With the ATA error model, an NCQ command failure always triggers an abort
(termination) of all NCQ commands queued on the device. In such case, the
SAT or the host must handle the failed command according to the command
sense data and immediately retry all other NCQ commands that were aborted
due to the failed NCQ command.

For SAS HBAs controlled by the mpi3mr driver, NCQ command aborts are not
handled by the HBA SAT and sent back to the host, with an ioc log
information equal to 0x31080000 (IOC_LOGINFO_PREFIX_PL with the PL code
PL_LOGINFO_CODE_SATA_NCQ_FAIL_ALL_CMDS_AFTR_ERR). The function
mpi3mr_process_op_reply_desc() always forces a retry of commands
terminated with the status MPI3_IOCSTATUS_SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED using the
SCSI result DID_SOFT_ERROR, regardless of the ioc_loginfo for the
command. This correctly forces the retry of collateral NCQ abort
commands, but with the retry counter for the command being incremented.
If a command to an ATA device is subject to too many retries due to other
NCQ commands failing (e.g. read commands trying to access unreadable
sectors), the collateral NCQ abort commands may be terminated with an
error as they run out of retries. This violates the SAT specification and
causes hard-to-debug command errors.

Solve this issue by modifying the handling of the
MPI3_IOCSTATUS_SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED status to check if a command is for an
ATA device and if the command ioc_loginfo indicates an NCQ collateral
abort. If that is the case, force the command retry using the SCSI result
DID_IMM_RETRY to avoid incrementing the command retry count.

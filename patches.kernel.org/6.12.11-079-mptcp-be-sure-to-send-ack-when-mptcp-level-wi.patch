Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: be sure to send ack when mptcp-level window re-opens
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.11
Git-commit: 2ca06a2f65310aeef30bb69b7405437a14766e4d

commit 2ca06a2f65310aeef30bb69b7405437a14766e4d upstream.

mptcp_cleanup_rbuf() is responsible to send acks when the user-space
reads enough data to update the receive windows significantly.

It tries hard to avoid acquiring the subflow sockets locks by checking
conditions similar to the ones implemented at the TCP level.

To avoid too much code duplication - the MPTCP protocol can't reuse the
TCP helpers as part of the relevant status is maintained into the msk
socket - and multiple costly window size computation, mptcp_cleanup_rbuf
uses a rough estimate for the most recently advertised window size:
the MPTCP receive free space, as recorded as at last-ack time.

Unfortunately the above does not allow mptcp_cleanup_rbuf() to detect
a zero to non-zero win change in some corner cases, skipping the
tcp_cleanup_rbuf call and leaving the peer stuck.

After commit ea66758c1795 ("tcp: allow MPTCP to update the announced
window"), MPTCP has actually cheap access to the announced window value.
Use it in mptcp_cleanup_rbuf() for a more accurate ack generation.

Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST bit in
 rtw_sdio_rx_isr()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.4.7
Git-commit: e967229ead0e6c5047a1cfd5a0db58ceb930800b

[ Upstream commit e967229ead0e6c5047a1cfd5a0db58ceb930800b ]

rtw_sdio_rx_isr() is responsible for receiving data from the wifi chip
and is called from the SDIO interrupt handler when the interrupt status
register (HISR) has the RX_REQUEST bit set. After the first batch of
data has been processed by the driver the wifi chip may have more data
ready to be read, which is managed by a loop in rtw_sdio_rx_isr().

It turns out that there are cases where the RX buffer length (from the
REG_SDIO_RX0_REQ_LEN register) does not match the data we receive. The
following two cases were observed with a RTL8723DS card:
- RX length is smaller than the total packet length including overhead
  and actual data bytes (whose length is part of the buffer we read from
  the wifi chip and is stored in rtw_rx_pkt_stat.pkt_len). This can
  result in errors like:
    skbuff: skb_over_panic: text:ffff8000011924ac len:3341 put:3341
  (one case observed was: RX buffer length = 1536 bytes but
   rtw_rx_pkt_stat.pkt_len = 1546 bytes, this is not valid as it means
   we need to read beyond the end of the buffer)
- RX length looks valid but rtw_rx_pkt_stat.pkt_len is zero

Check if the RX_REQUEST is set in the HISR register for each iteration
inside rtw_sdio_rx_isr(). This mimics what the RTL8723DS vendor driver
does and makes the driver only read more data if the RX_REQUEST bit is
set (which seems to be a way for the card's hardware or firmware to
tell the host that data is ready to be processed).

For RTW_WCPU_11AC chips this check is not needed. The RTL8822BS vendor
driver for example states that this check is unnecessary (but still uses
it) and the RTL8822CS drops this check entirely.

Subject: [PATCH] xfrm: fix netdev reference count imbalance
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.10.3
Git-commit: 9199b915e9fad7f5eff6160d24ff6b38e970107d

[ Upstream commit 9199b915e9fad7f5eff6160d24ff6b38e970107d ]

In cited commit, netdev_tracker_alloc() is called for the newly
allocated xfrm state, but dev_hold() is missed, which causes netdev
reference count imbalance, because netdev_put() is called when the
state is freed in xfrm_dev_state_free(). Fix the issue by replacing
netdev_tracker_alloc() with netdev_hold().

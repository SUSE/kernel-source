Subject: [PATCH] netfilter: br_netfilter: do not check confirmed bit in
 br_nf_local_in() after confirm
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.6
Git-commit: 479a54ab92087318514c82428a87af2d7af1a576

[ Upstream commit 479a54ab92087318514c82428a87af2d7af1a576 ]

When send a broadcast packet to a tap device, which was added to a bridge,
br_nf_local_in() is called to confirm the conntrack. If another conntrack
with the same hash value is added to the hash table, which can be
triggered by a normal packet to a non-bridge device, the below warning
may happen.

To solve the hash conflict, nf_ct_resolve_clash() try to merge the
conntracks, and update skb->_nfct. However, br_nf_local_in() still use the
old ct from local variable 'nfct' after confirm(), which leads to this
warning.

If confirm() does not insert the conntrack entry and return NF_DROP, the
warning may also occur. There is no need to reserve the WARN_ON_ONCE, just
remove it.

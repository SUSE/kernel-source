Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/sqpoll: close race on waiting for sqring entries
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.5
Git-commit: 28aabffae6be54284869a91cd8bccd3720041129

commit 28aabffae6be54284869a91cd8bccd3720041129 upstream.

When an application uses SQPOLL, it must wait for the SQPOLL thread to
consume SQE entries, if it fails to get an sqe when calling
io_uring_get_sqe(). It can do so by calling io_uring_enter(2) with the
flag value of IORING_ENTER_SQ_WAIT. In liburing, this is generally done
with io_uring_sqring_wait(). There's a natural expectation that once
this call returns, a new SQE entry can be retrieved, filled out, and
submitted. However, the kernel uses the cached sq head to determine if
the SQRING is full or not. If the SQPOLL thread is currently in the
process of submitting SQE entries, it may have updated the cached sq
head, but not yet committed it to the SQ ring. Hence the kernel may find
that there are SQE entries ready to be consumed, and return successfully
to the application. If the SQPOLL thread hasn't yet committed the SQ
ring entries by the time the application returns to userspace and
attempts to get a new SQE, it will fail getting a new SQE.

Fix this by having io_sqring_full() always use the user visible SQ ring
head entry, rather than the internally cached one.

Subject: [PATCH] dm mirror log: clear log bits up to BITS_PER_LONG boundary
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.8
Git-commit: 90736eb3232d208ee048493f371075e4272e0944

commit 90736eb3232d208ee048493f371075e4272e0944 upstream.

Commit 85e123c27d5c ("dm mirror log: round up region bitmap size to
BITS_PER_LONG") introduced a regression on 64-bit architectures in the
lvm testsuite tests: lvcreate-mirror, mirror-names and vgsplit-operation.

If the device is shrunk, we need to clear log bits beyond the end of the
device. The code clears bits up to a 32-bit boundary and then calculates
lc->sync_count by summing set bits up to a 64-bit boundary (the commit
changed that; previously, this boundary was 32-bit too). So, it was using
some non-zeroed bits in the calculation and this caused misbehavior.

Fix this regression by clearing bits up to BITS_PER_LONG boundary.

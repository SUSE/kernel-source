Subject: [PATCH] serial: msm: Configure correct working mode before starting
 earlycon
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.26
Git-commit: 7094832b5ac861b0bd7ed8866c93cb15ef619996

commit 7094832b5ac861b0bd7ed8866c93cb15ef619996 upstream.

The MSM UART DM controller supports different working modes, e.g. DMA or
the "single-character mode", where all reads/writes operate on a single
character rather than 4 chars (32-bit) at once. When using earlycon,
__msm_console_write() always writes 4 characters at a time, but we don't
know which mode the bootloader was using and we don't set the mode either.

This causes garbled output if the bootloader was using the single-character
mode, because only every 4th character appears in the serial console, e.g.

  "[ 00oni pi  000xf0[ 00i s 5rm9(l)l s 1  1 SPMTA 7:C 5[ 00A ade k d[
   00ano:ameoi .Q1B[ 00ac _idaM00080oo'"

If the bootloader was using the DMA ("DM") mode, output would likely fail
entirely. Later, when the full serial driver probes, the port is
re-initialized and output works as expected.

Fix this also for earlycon by clearing the DMEN register and
reset+re-enable the transmitter to apply the change. This ensures the
transmitter is in the expected state before writing any output.

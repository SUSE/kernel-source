Subject: [PATCH] scsi: ufs: core: Do not set link to OFF state while waking up
 from hibernation
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.46
Git-commit: ac6efb12ca64156f4a94e964acdb96ee7d59630d

commit ac6efb12ca64156f4a94e964acdb96ee7d59630d upstream.

UFS link is just put into hibern8 state during the 'freeze' process of the
hibernation. Afterwards, the system may get powered down. But that doesn't
matter during wakeup. Because during wakeup from hibernation, UFS link is
again put into hibern8 state by the restore kernel and then the control is
handed over to the to image kernel.

So in both the places, UFS link is never turned OFF. But
ufshcd_system_restore() just assumes that the link will be in OFF state and
sets the link state accordingly. And this breaks hibernation wakeup:

[ 2445.371335] phy phy-1d87000.phy.3: phy_power_on was called before phy_init
[ 2445.427883] ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufshc: Controller enable failed
[ 2445.427890] ufshcd-qcom 1d84000.ufshc: ufshcd_host_reset_and_restore: Host init failed -5
[ 2445.427906] ufs_device_wlun 0:0:0:49488: ufshcd_wl_resume failed: -5
[ 2445.427918] ufs_device_wlun 0:0:0:49488: PM: dpm_run_callback(): scsi_bus_restore returns -5
[ 2445.427973] ufs_device_wlun 0:0:0:49488: PM: failed to restore async: error -5

So fix the issue by removing the code that sets the link to OFF state.

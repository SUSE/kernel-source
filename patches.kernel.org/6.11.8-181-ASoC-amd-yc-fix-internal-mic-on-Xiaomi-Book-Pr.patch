Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: amd: yc: fix internal mic on Xiaomi Book Pro 14 2022
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.8
Git-commit: de156f3cf70e17dc6ff4c3c364bb97a6db961ffd

commit de156f3cf70e17dc6ff4c3c364bb97a6db961ffd upstream.

Xiaomi Book Pro 14 2022 (MIA2210-AD) requires a quirk entry for its
internal microphone to be enabled.

This is likely due to similar reasons as seen previously on Redmi Book
14/15 Pro 2022 models (since they likely came with similar firmware):

- commit dcff8b7ca92d ("ASoC: amd: yc: Add Xiaomi Redmi Book Pro 15 2022
  into DMI table")
- commit c1dd6bf61997 ("ASoC: amd: yc: Add Xiaomi Redmi Book Pro 14 2022
  into DMI table")

A quirk would likely be needed for Xiaomi Book Pro 15 2022 models, too.
However, I do not have such device on hand so I will leave it for now.

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: display/msm: qcom,mdp5: drop lut clock
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.16.5
Git-commit: 7ab3b7579a6d2660a3425b9ea93b9a140b07f49c

[ Upstream commit 7ab3b7579a6d2660a3425b9ea93b9a140b07f49c ]

None of MDP5 platforms have a LUT clock on the display-controller, it
was added by the mistake. Drop it, fixing DT warnings on MSM8976 /
MSM8956 platforms. Technically it's an ABI break, but no other platforms
are affected.

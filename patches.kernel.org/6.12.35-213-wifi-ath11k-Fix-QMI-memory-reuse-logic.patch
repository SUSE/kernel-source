Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath11k: Fix QMI memory reuse logic
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.35
Git-commit: cd2e7bae92bd7e65063ab8d04721d2b711ba4cbe

[ Upstream commit cd2e7bae92bd7e65063ab8d04721d2b711ba4cbe ]

Firmware requests 2 segments at first. The first segment is of 6799360
whose allocation fails due to dma remapping not available. The success
is returned to firmware. Then firmware asks for 22 smaller segments
instead of 2 big ones. Those get allocated successfully. At suspend/
hibernation time, these segments aren't freed as they will be reused
by firmware after resuming.

After resuming, the firmware asks for the 2 segments again with the
first segment of 6799360 size. Since chunk->vaddr is not NULL, the
type and size are compared with the previous type and size to know if
it can be reused or not. Unfortunately, it is detected that it cannot
be reused and this first smaller segment is freed. Then we continue to
allocate 6799360 size memory which fails and ath11k_qmi_free_target_mem_chunk()
is called which frees the second smaller segment as well. Later success
is returned to firmware which asks for 22 smaller segments again. But
as we had freed 2 segments already, we'll allocate the first 2 new
smaller segments again and reuse the remaining 20. Hence 20 small
segments are being reused instead of 22.

Add skip logic when vaddr is set, but size/type don't match. Use the
same skip and success logic as used when dma_alloc_coherent() fails.
By skipping, the possibility of resume failure due to kernel failing to
allocate memory for QMI can be avoided.

	kernel: ath11k_pci 0000:03:00.0: failed to allocate dma memory for qmi (524288 B type 1)
	ath11k_pci 0000:03:00.0: failed to allocate qmi target memory: -22

Tested-on: WCN6855 WLAN.HSP.1.1-03926.13-QCAHSPSWPL_V2_SILICONZ_CE-2.52297.6

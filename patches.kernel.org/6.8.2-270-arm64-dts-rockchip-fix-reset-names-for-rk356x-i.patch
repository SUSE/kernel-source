[ Upstream commit 0fc19ab75acde78558bd0f6fe3e5f63cf8ee88b0 ]

The dtbscheck reports a warning for a wrong reset-names property for
the i2s2 controller on rk356x socs.

The other controllers on the soc provide tx and rx directions and hence
two resets and separate clocks for each direction, while i2s2 only
provides one reset. This was so far named just "m" which isn't part of
the binding.

The clock-names the controller uses all end in "tx", so use the matching
"tx-m" reset-name for the i2s controller.

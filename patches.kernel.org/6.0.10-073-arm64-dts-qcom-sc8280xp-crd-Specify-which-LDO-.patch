Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp-crd: Specify which LDO modes are
 allowed
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.0.10
Git-commit: a4543e21ae363f4f094fb3c3503d77029e0c5d90

[ Upstream commit a4543e21ae363f4f094fb3c3503d77029e0c5d90 ]

This board uses RPMH, specifies "regulator-allow-set-load" for LDOs,
but doesn't specify any modes with "regulator-allowed-modes".

Prior to commit efb0cb50c427 ("regulator: qcom-rpmh: Implement
get_optimum_mode(), not set_load()") the above meant that we were able
to set either LPM or HPM mode. After that commit (and fixes [1]) we'll
be stuck at the initial mode. Discussion of this has resulted in the
decision that the old dts files were wrong and should be fixed to
fully restore old functionality.

Let's re-enable the old functionality by fixing the dts.

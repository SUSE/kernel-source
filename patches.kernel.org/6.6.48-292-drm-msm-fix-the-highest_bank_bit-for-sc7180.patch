Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm: fix the highest_bank_bit for sc7180
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.48
Git-commit: 3e30296b374af33cb4c12ff93df0b1e5b2d0f80b

[ Upstream commit 3e30296b374af33cb4c12ff93df0b1e5b2d0f80b ]

sc7180 programs the ubwc settings as 0x1e as that would mean a
highest bank bit of 14 which matches what the GPU sets as well.

However, the highest_bank_bit field of the msm_mdss_data which is
being used to program the SSPP's fetch configuration is programmed
to a highest bank bit of 16 as 0x3 translates to 16 and not 14.

Fix the highest bank bit field used for the SSPP to match the mdss
and gpu settings.

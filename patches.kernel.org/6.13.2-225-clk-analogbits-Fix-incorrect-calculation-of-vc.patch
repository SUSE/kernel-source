Subject: [PATCH] clk: analogbits: Fix incorrect calculation of vco rate delta
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.13.2
Git-commit: d7f12857f095ef38523399d47e68787b357232f6

[ Upstream commit d7f12857f095ef38523399d47e68787b357232f6 ]

In wrpll_configure_for_rate() we try to determine the best PLL
configuration for a target rate. However, in the loop where we try
values of R, we should compare the derived `vco` with `target_vco_rate`.
However, we were in fact comparing it with `target_rate`, which is
actually after Q shift. This is incorrect, and sometimes can result in
suboptimal clock rates. Fix it.

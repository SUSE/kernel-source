Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: omap36xx: declare 1GHz OPP as turbo again
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.12.2
Git-commit: 96a64e9730c2c76cfa5c510583a0fbf40d62886b

commit 96a64e9730c2c76cfa5c510583a0fbf40d62886b upstream.

Operating stable without reduced chip life at 1Ghz needs several
technologies working: The technologies involve
- SmartReflex
- DVFS

As this cannot directly specified in the OPP table as dependecies in the
devicetree yet, use the turbo flag again to mark this OPP as something
special to have some kind of opt-in.

So revert commit
5f1bf7ae8481 ("ARM: dts: omap36xx: Remove turbo mode for 1GHz variants")

Practical reasoning:
At least the GTA04A5 (DM3730) has become unstable with that OPP enabled.
Furthermore nothing enforces the availability of said technologies,
even in the kernel configuration, so allow users to rather opt-in.

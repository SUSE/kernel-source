Subject: [PATCH] net, neigh: Set lower cap for neigh_managed_work rearming
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.4
Git-commit: ed6cd6a17896561b9f51ab4c0d9bbb29e762b597

[ Upstream commit ed6cd6a17896561b9f51ab4c0d9bbb29e762b597 ]

Yuwei reported that plain reuse of DELAY_PROBE_TIME to rearm work queue
in neigh_managed_work is problematic if user explicitly configures the
DELAY_PROBE_TIME to 0 for a neighbor table. Such misconfig can then hog
CPU to 100% processing the system work queue. Instead, set lower interval
bound to HZ which is totally sufficient. Yuwei is additionally looking
into making the interval separately configurable from DELAY_PROBE_TIME.

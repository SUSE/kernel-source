Subject: [PATCH] cpuidle: menu: Avoid discarding useful information
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 85975daeaa4d6ec560bfcd354fc9c08ad7f38888

[ Upstream commit 85975daeaa4d6ec560bfcd354fc9c08ad7f38888 ]

When giving up on making a high-confidence prediction,
get_typical_interval() always returns UINT_MAX which means that the
next idle interval prediction will be based entirely on the time till
the next timer.  However, the information represented by the most
recent intervals may not be completely useless in those cases.

Namely, the largest recent idle interval is an upper bound on the
recently observed idle duration, so it is reasonable to assume that
the next idle duration is unlikely to exceed it.  Moreover, this is
still true after eliminating the suspected outliers if the sample
set still under consideration is at least as large as 50% of the
maximum sample set size.

Accordingly, make get_typical_interval() return the current maximum
recent interval value in that case instead of UINT_MAX.

Subject: [PATCH] HID: i2c-hid: improve i2c_hid_get_report error message
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.23
Git-commit: 723aa55c08c9d1e0734e39a815fd41272eac8269

[ Upstream commit 723aa55c08c9d1e0734e39a815fd41272eac8269 ]

We have two places to print "failed to set a report to ...",
use "get a report from" instead of "set a report to", it makes
people who knows less about the module to know where the error
happened.

Before:
i2c_hid_acpi i2c-FTSC1000:00: failed to set a report to device: -11

After:
i2c_hid_acpi i2c-FTSC1000:00: failed to get a report from device: -11

Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/rw: treat -EOPNOTSUPP for IOCB_NOWAIT like -EAGAIN
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.68
Git-commit: c0a9d496e0fece67db777bd48550376cf2960c47

Commit c0a9d496e0fece67db777bd48550376cf2960c47 upstream.

Some file systems, ocfs2 in this case, will return -EOPNOTSUPP for
an IOCB_NOWAIT read/write attempt. While this can be argued to be
correct, the usual return value for something that requires blocking
issue is -EAGAIN.

A refactoring io_uring commit dropped calling kiocb_done() for
negative return values, which is otherwise where we already do that
transformation. To ensure we catch it in both spots, check it in
__io_read() itself as well.

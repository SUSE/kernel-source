Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Revert "Add a secondary AT port
 to Telit FN990"
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.2
Git-commit: 14853a0676c126aad836eb249499552fa9d6e85a

commit 14853a0676c126aad836eb249499552fa9d6e85a upstream.

This reverts commit 2d5253a096c6057bbf7caa5520856dcdf7eca8bb.
There are 2 commits with commit message "Add a secondary AT port to Telit
FN990":

commit 2d5253a096c6 ("bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Add a secondary AT port
to Telit FN990")
commit 479aa3b0ec2e ("bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Add a secondary AT port
to Telit FN990")

This turned out to be due to the patch getting applied through different
trees and git settled on a resolution while applying it second time. But
the second AT port of Foxconn devices don't work in PCIe mode. So the
second commit needs to be reverted.

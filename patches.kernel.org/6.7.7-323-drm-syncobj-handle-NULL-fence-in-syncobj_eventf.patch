Subject: [PATCH] drm/syncobj: handle NULL fence in syncobj_eventfd_entry_func
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.7
Git-commit: 2aa6f5b0fd052e363bb9d4b547189f0bf6b3d6d3

[ Upstream commit 2aa6f5b0fd052e363bb9d4b547189f0bf6b3d6d3 ]

During syncobj_eventfd_entry_func, dma_fence_chain_find_seqno may set
the fence to NULL if the given seqno is signaled and a later seqno has
already been submitted. In that case, the eventfd should be signaled
immediately which currently does not happen.

This is a similar issue to the one addressed by commit b19926d4f3a6
("drm/syncobj: Deal with signalled fences in drm_syncobj_find_fence.").

As a fix, if the return value of dma_fence_chain_find_seqno indicates
success but it sets the fence to NULL, we will assign a stub fence to
ensure the following code still signals the eventfd.

v1 -> v2: assign a stub fence instead of signaling the eventfd

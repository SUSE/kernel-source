Subject: [PATCH] md: don't rely on 'mddev->pers' to be set in mddev_suspend()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.3
Git-commit: b721e7885eb242aa2459ee66bb42ceef1bcf0f0c

[ Upstream commit b721e7885eb242aa2459ee66bb42ceef1bcf0f0c ]

'active_io' used to be initialized while the array is running, and
'mddev->pers' is set while the array is running as well. Hence caller
must hold 'reconfig_mutex' and guarantee 'mddev->pers' is set before
calling mddev_suspend().

Now that 'active_io' is initialized when mddev is allocated, such
restriction doesn't exist anymore. In the meantime, follow up patches
will refactor mddev_suspend(), hence add checking for 'mddev->pers' to
prevent null-ptr-deref.

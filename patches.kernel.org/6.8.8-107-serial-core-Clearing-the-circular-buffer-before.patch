Subject: [PATCH] serial: core: Clearing the circular buffer before NULLifying
 it
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.8.8
Git-commit: 9cf7ea2eeb745213dc2a04103e426b960e807940

commit 9cf7ea2eeb745213dc2a04103e426b960e807940 upstream.

The circular buffer is NULLified in uart_tty_port_shutdown()
under the spin lock. However, the PM or other timer based callbacks
may still trigger after this event without knowning that buffer pointer
is not valid. Since the serial code is a bit inconsistent in checking
the buffer state (some rely on the head-tail positions, some on the
buffer pointer), it's better to have both aligned, i.e. buffer pointer
to be NULL and head-tail possitions to be the same, meaning it's empty.
This will prevent asynchronous calls to dereference NULL pointer as
reported recently in 8250 case:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000cf5
  Workqueue: pm pm_runtime_work
  EIP: serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)
  ...
  ? serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)
  __start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1551)
  serial8250_start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1654)
  serial_port_runtime_suspend (include/linux/serial_core.h:667 drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:63)
  __rpm_callback (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:393)
  ? serial_port_remove (drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:50)
  rpm_suspend (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:447)

The proposed change will prevent ->start_tx() to be called during
suspend on shut down port.

Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: Introduce policy->boost_supported flag
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.14.6
Git-commit: 1f7d1bab50e6ae517f8b6699e56d709d61ae13e5

[ Upstream commit 1f7d1bab50e6ae517f8b6699e56d709d61ae13e5 ]

It is possible to have a scenario where not all cpufreq policies support
boost frequencies. And letting sysfs (or other parts of the kernel)
enable boost feature for that policy isn't correct.

Add a new flag, boost_supported, which will be set to true by the
cpufreq core only if the freq table contains valid boost frequencies.

Some cpufreq drivers though don't have boost frequencies in the
freq-table, they can set this flag from their ->init() callbacks.

Once all the drivers are updated to set the flag correctly, we can check
it before enabling boost feature for a policy.

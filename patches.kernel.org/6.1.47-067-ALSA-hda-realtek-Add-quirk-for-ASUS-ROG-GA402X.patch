Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for ASUS ROG GA402X
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.47
Git-commit: 9abc77fb144fe916fd2f592dc4b8c7bade02e58a

[ Upstream commit 9abc77fb144fe916fd2f592dc4b8c7bade02e58a ]

Adds the required quirk to enable the Cirrus amp and correct pins
on the ASUS ROG GA402X series which uses an I2C connected Cirrus amp.

While this works if the related _DSD properties are made available, these
aren't included in the ACPI of these laptops (yet).

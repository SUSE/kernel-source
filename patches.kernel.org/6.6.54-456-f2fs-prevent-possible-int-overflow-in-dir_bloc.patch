Subject: [PATCH] f2fs: prevent possible int overflow in dir_block_index()
References: bsc#1218260
Patch-mainline: 6.6.54
Git-commit: 47f268f33dff4a5e31541a990dc09f116f80e61c

commit 47f268f33dff4a5e31541a990dc09f116f80e61c upstream.

The result of multiplication between values derived from functions
dir_buckets() and bucket_blocks() *could* technically reach
2^30 * 2^2 = 2^32.

While unlikely to happen, it is prudent to ensure that it will not
lead to integer overflow. Thus, use mul_u32_u32() as it's more
appropriate to mitigate the issue.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
analysis tool SVACE.

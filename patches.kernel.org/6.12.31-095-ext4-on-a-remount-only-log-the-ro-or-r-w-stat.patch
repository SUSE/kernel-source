Subject: [PATCH] ext4: on a remount, only log the ro or r/w state when it has
 changed
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: d7b0befd09320e3356a75cb96541c030515e7f5f

[ Upstream commit d7b0befd09320e3356a75cb96541c030515e7f5f ]

A user complained that a message such as:

EXT4-fs (nvme0n1p3): re-mounted UUID ro. Quota mode: none.

implied that the file system was previously mounted read/write and was
now remounted read-only, when it could have been some other mount
state that had changed by the "mount -o remount" operation.  Fix this
by only logging "ro"or "r/w" when it has changed.

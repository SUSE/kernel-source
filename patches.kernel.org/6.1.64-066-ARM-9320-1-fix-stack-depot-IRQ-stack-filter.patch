Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 9320/1: fix stack depot IRQ stack filter
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.64
Git-commit: b0150014878c32197cfa66e3e2f79e57f66babc0

[ Upstream commit b0150014878c32197cfa66e3e2f79e57f66babc0 ]

Place IRQ handlers such as gic_handle_irq() in the irqentry section even
if FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER is not enabled.  Without this, the stack
depot's filter_irq_stacks() does not correctly filter out IRQ stacks in
those configurations, which hampers deduplication and eventually leads
to "Stack depot reached limit capacity" splats with KASAN.

A similar fix was done for arm64 in commit f6794950f0e5ba37e3bbed
("arm64: set __exception_irq_entry with __irq_entry as a default").

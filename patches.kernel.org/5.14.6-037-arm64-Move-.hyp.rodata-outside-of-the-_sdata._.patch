Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Move .hyp.rodata outside of the _sdata.._edata range
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.6
Git-commit: eb48d154cd0dade56a0e244f0cfa198ea2925ed3

commit eb48d154cd0dade56a0e244f0cfa198ea2925ed3 upstream.

The HYP rodata section is currently lumped together with the BSS,
which isn't exactly what is expected (it gets registered with
kmemleak, for example).

Move it away so that it is actually marked RO. As an added
benefit, it isn't registered with kmemleak anymore.

Fixes: 380e18ade4a5 ("KVM: arm64: Introduce a BSS section for use at Hyp")

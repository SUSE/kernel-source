Subject: [PATCH] lib/group_cpus.c: avoid acquiring cpu hotplug lock in
 group_cpus_evenly
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.72
Git-commit: 0263f92fadbb9d294d5971ac57743f882c93b2b3

[ Upstream commit 0263f92fadbb9d294d5971ac57743f882c93b2b3 ]

group_cpus_evenly() could be part of storage driver's error handler, such
as nvme driver, when may happen during CPU hotplug, in which storage queue
has to drain its pending IOs because all CPUs associated with the queue
are offline and the queue is becoming inactive.  And handling IO needs
error handler to provide forward progress.

Then deadlock is caused:

1) inside CPU hotplug handler, CPU hotplug lock is held, and blk-mq's
   handler is waiting for inflight IO

2) error handler is waiting for CPU hotplug lock

3) inflight IO can't be completed in blk-mq's CPU hotplug handler
   because error handling can't provide forward progress.

Solve the deadlock by not holding CPU hotplug lock in group_cpus_evenly(),
in which two stage spreads are taken: 1) the 1st stage is over all present
CPUs; 2) the end stage is over all other CPUs.

Turns out the two stage spread just needs consistent 'cpu_present_mask',
and remove the CPU hotplug lock by storing it into one local cache.  This
way doesn't change correctness, because all CPUs are still covered.

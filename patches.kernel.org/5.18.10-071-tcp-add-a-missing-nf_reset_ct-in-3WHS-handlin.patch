Subject: [PATCH] tcp: add a missing nf_reset_ct() in 3WHS handling
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.18.10
Git-commit: 6f0012e35160cd08a53e46e3b3bbf724b92dfe68

commit 6f0012e35160cd08a53e46e3b3bbf724b92dfe68 upstream.

When the third packet of 3WHS connection establishment
contains payload, it is added into socket receive queue
without the XFRM check and the drop of connection tracking
context.

This means that if the data is left unread in the socket
receive queue, conntrack module can not be unloaded.

As most applications usually reads the incoming data
immediately after accept(), bug has been hiding for
quite a long time.

Commit 68822bdf76f1 ("net: generalize skb freeing
deferral to per-cpu lists") exposed this bug because
even if the application reads this data, the skb
with nfct state could stay in a per-cpu cache for
an arbitrary time, if said cpu no longer process RX softirqs.

Many thanks to Ilya Maximets for reporting this issue,
and for testing various patches:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20220619003919.394622-1-i.maximets@ovn.org/

Note that I also added a missing xfrm4_policy_check() call,
although this is probably not a big issue, as the SYN
packet should have been dropped earlier.

Fixes: b59c270104f0 ("[NETFILTER]: Keep conntrack reference until IPsec policy checks are done")

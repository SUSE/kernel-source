Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: video: Don't enable fallback path for creating ACPI
 backlight by default
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.5
Git-commit: 5aa9d943e9b6bf6e6023645cbe7ce7d5ed84baf4

[ Upstream commit 5aa9d943e9b6bf6e6023645cbe7ce7d5ed84baf4 ]

The ACPI video detection code has a module parameter
`register_backlight_delay` which is currently configured to 8 seconds.
This means that if after 8 seconds of booting no native driver has created
a backlight device then the code will attempt to make an ACPI video
backlight device.

This was intended as a safety mechanism with the backlight overhaul that
occurred in kernel 6.1, but as it doesn't appear necesssary set it to be
disabled by default.

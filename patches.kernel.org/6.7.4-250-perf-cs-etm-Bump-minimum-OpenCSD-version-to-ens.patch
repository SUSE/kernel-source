Subject: [PATCH] perf cs-etm: Bump minimum OpenCSD version to ensure a bugfix
 is present
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.4
Git-commit: 2dbba30fd69b604802a9535b74bddb5bcca23793

[ Upstream commit 2dbba30fd69b604802a9535b74bddb5bcca23793 ]

Since commit d927ef5004ef ("perf cs-etm: Add exception level consistency
check"), the exception that was added to Perf will be triggered unless
the following bugfix from OpenCSD is present:

 - _Version 1.2.1_:
  - __Bugfix__:
    ETM4x / ETE - output of context elements to client can in some
    circumstances be delayed until after subsequent atoms have been
    processed leading to incorrect memory decode access via the client
    callbacks. Fixed to flush context elements immediately they are
    committed.

Rather than remove the assert and silently fail, just increase the
minimum version requirement to avoid hard to debug issues and
regressions.

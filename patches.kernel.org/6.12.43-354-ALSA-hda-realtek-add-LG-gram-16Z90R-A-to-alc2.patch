Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek: add LG gram 16Z90R-A to alc269 fixup table
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.43
Git-commit: dbe05428c4e54068a86e7e02405f3b30b1d2b3dd

[ Upstream commit dbe05428c4e54068a86e7e02405f3b30b1d2b3dd ]

Several months ago, Joshua Grisham submitted a patch [1]
for several ALC298 based sound cards.

The entry for the LG gram 16 in the alc269_fixup_tbl only matches the
Subsystem ID for the 16Z90R-Q and 16Z90R-K models [2]. My 16Z90R-A has a
different Subsystem ID [3]. I'm not sure why these IDs differ, but I
speculate it's due to the NVIDIA GPU included in the 16Z90R-A model that
isn't present in the other models.

I applied the patch to the latest Arch Linux kernel and the card was
initialized as expected.

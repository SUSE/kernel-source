Subject: [PATCH] skb: Do mix page pool and page referenced frags in GRO
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.11
Git-commit: 7d2c89b325874a35564db5630a459966afab04cc

[ Upstream commit 7d2c89b325874a35564db5630a459966afab04cc ]

GSO should not merge page pool recycled frames with standard reference
counted frames. Traditionally this didn't occur, at least not often.
However as we start looking at adding support for wireless adapters there
becomes the potential to mix the two due to A-MSDU repartitioning frames in
the receive path. There are possibly other places where this may have
occurred however I suspect they must be few and far between as we have not
seen this issue until now.

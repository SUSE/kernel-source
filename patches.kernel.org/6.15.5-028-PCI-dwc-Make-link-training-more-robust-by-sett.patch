Subject: [PATCH] PCI: dwc: Make link training more robust by setting
 PORT_LOGIC_LINK_WIDTH to one lane
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.5
Git-commit: af3c6eacce0c464f28fe0e3d365b3860aba07931

[ Upstream commit af3c6eacce0c464f28fe0e3d365b3860aba07931 ]

As per DWC PCIe registers description 4.30a, section 1.13.43, NUM_OF_LANES
named as PORT_LOGIC_LINK_WIDTH in PCIe DWC driver, is referred to as the
"Predetermined Number of Lanes" in PCIe r6.0, sec 4.2.7.2.1, which explains
the conditions required to enter Polling.Configuration:

  Next state is Polling.Configuration after at least 1024 TS1 Ordered Sets
  were transmitted, and all Lanes that detected a Receiver during Detect
  receive eight consecutive training sequences ...

  Otherwise, after a 24 ms timeout the next state is:

    Polling.Configuration if,

      (i) Any Lane, which detected a Receiver during Detect, received eight
      consecutive training sequences ... and a minimum of 1024 TS1 Ordered
      Sets are transmitted after receiving one TS1 or TS2 Ordered Set.

      And

      (ii) At least a predetermined set of Lanes that detected a Receiver
      during Detect have detected an exit from Electrical Idle at least
      once since entering Polling.Active.

	Note: This may prevent one or more bad Receivers or Transmitters
	from holding up a valid Link from being configured, and allow for
	additional training in Polling.Configuration. The exact set of
	predetermined Lanes is implementation specific.

	Note: Any Lane that receives eight consecutive TS1 or TS2 Ordered
	Sets should have detected an exit from Electrical Idle at least
	once since entering Polling.Active.

In a PCIe link supporting multiple lanes, if PORT_LOGIC_LINK_WIDTH is set
to lane width the hardware supports, all lanes that detect a receiver
during the Detect phase must receive eight consecutive training sequences.
Otherwise, LTSSM will not enter Polling.Configuration and link training
will fail.

Therefore, always set PORT_LOGIC_LINK_WIDTH to 1, regardless of the number
of lanes the port actually supports, to make link up more robust. This
setting will not affect the intended link width if all lanes are
functional. Additionally, the link can still be established with at least
one lane if other lanes are faulty.

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: imx8mm-venice-gw7904: disable disp_blk_ctrl
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.45
Git-commit: f7a0b57524cf811ac06257a5099f1b7c19ee7310

[ Upstream commit f7a0b57524cf811ac06257a5099f1b7c19ee7310 ]

The GW7904 does not connect the VDD_MIPI power rails thus MIPI is
disabled. However we must also disable disp_blk_ctrl as it uses the
pgc_mipi power domain and without it being disabled imx8m-blk-ctrl will
fail to probe:
imx8m-blk-ctrl 32e28000.blk-ctrl: error -ETIMEDOUT: failed to attach
power domain "mipi-dsi"
imx8m-blk-ctrl: probe of 32e28000.blk-ctrl failed with error -110

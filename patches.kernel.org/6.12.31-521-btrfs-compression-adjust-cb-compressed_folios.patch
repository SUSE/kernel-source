Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: compression: adjust cb->compressed_folios allocation
 type
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.31
Git-commit: 6f9a8ab796c6528d22de3c504c81fce7dde63d8a

[ Upstream commit 6f9a8ab796c6528d22de3c504c81fce7dde63d8a ]

In preparation for making the kmalloc() family of allocators type aware,
we need to make sure that the returned type from the allocation matches
the type of the variable being assigned. (Before, the allocator would
always return "void *", which can be implicitly cast to any pointer type.)

The assigned type is "struct folio **" but the returned type will be
"struct page **". These are the same allocation size (pointer size), but
the types don't match. Adjust the allocation type to match the assignment.

Subject: [PATCH] iio: imu: inv_icm42600: switch timestamp type from int64_t
 __aligned(8) to aligned_s64
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.44
Git-commit: 27e6ddf291b1c05bfcc3534e8212ed6c46447c60

[ Upstream commit 27e6ddf291b1c05bfcc3534e8212ed6c46447c60 ]

The vast majority of IIO drivers use aligned_s64 for the type of the
timestamp field.  It is not a bug to use int64_t and until this series
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp() took and int64_t timestamp, it
is inconsistent.  This change is to remove that inconsistency and
ensure there is one obvious choice for future drivers.

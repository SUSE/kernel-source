Subject: [PATCH] scsi: core: Always send batch on reset or error handling
 command
References: bsc#1218052
Patch-mainline: 6.1.70
Git-commit: 066c5b46b6eaf2f13f80c19500dbb3b84baabb33

commit 066c5b46b6eaf2f13f80c19500dbb3b84baabb33 upstream.

In commit 8930a6c20791 ("scsi: core: add support for request batching") the
block layer bd->last flag was mapped to SCMD_LAST and used as an indicator
to send the batch for the drivers that implement this feature. However, the
error handling code was not updated accordingly.

scsi_send_eh_cmnd() is used to send error handling commands and request
sense. The problem is that request sense comes as a single command that
gets into the batch queue and times out. As a result the device goes
offline after several failed resets. This was observed on virtio_scsi
during a device resize operation.

[  496.316946] sd 0:0:4:0: [sdd] tag#117 scsi_eh_0: requesting sense
[  506.786356] sd 0:0:4:0: [sdd] tag#117 scsi_send_eh_cmnd timeleft: 0
[  506.787981] sd 0:0:4:0: [sdd] tag#117 abort

To fix this always set SCMD_LAST flag in scsi_send_eh_cmnd() and
scsi_reset_ioctl().

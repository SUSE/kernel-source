Subject: [PATCH] arm64/mm: Drop wrong writes into TCR2_EL1
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.15.7
Git-commit: 9dd1757493416310a5e71146a08bc228869f8dae

[ Upstream commit 9dd1757493416310a5e71146a08bc228869f8dae ]

Register X0 contains PIE_E1_ASM and should not be written into REG_TCR2_EL1
which could have an adverse impact otherwise. This has remained undetected
till now probably because current value for PIE_E1_ASM (0xcc880e0ac0800000)
clears TCR2_EL1 which again gets set subsequently with 'tcr2' after testing
for FEAT_TCR2.

Drop this unwarranted 'msr' which is a stray change from an earlier commit.
This line got re-introduced when rebasing on top of the commit 926b66e2ebc8
("arm64: setup: name 'tcr2' register").

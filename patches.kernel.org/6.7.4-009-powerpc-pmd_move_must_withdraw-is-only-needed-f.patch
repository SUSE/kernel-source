Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: pmd_move_must_withdraw() is only needed for
 CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.4
Git-commit: 0d555b57ee660d8a871781c0eebf006e855e918d

[ Upstream commit 0d555b57ee660d8a871781c0eebf006e855e918d ]

The linux-next build of powerpc64 allnoconfig fails with:

  arch/powerpc/mm/book3s64/pgtable.c:557:5: error: no previous prototype for 'pmd_move_must_withdraw'
    557 | int pmd_move_must_withdraw(struct spinlock *new_pmd_ptl,
        |     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Caused by commit:

  c6345dfa6e3e ("Makefile.extrawarn: turn on missing-prototypes globally")

Fix it by moving the function definition under
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE like the prototype. The function is only
called when CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y.

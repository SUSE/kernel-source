Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: correct stale comment of .get_budget
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: 01542f651a9f58a9b176c3d3dc3eefbacee53b78

[ Upstream commit 01542f651a9f58a9b176c3d3dc3eefbacee53b78 ]

Commit 88022d7201e96 ("blk-mq: don't handle failure in .get_budget")
remove BLK_STS_RESOURCE return value and we only check if we can get
the budget from .get_budget() now.
Correct stale comment that ".get_budget() returns BLK_STS_NO_RESOURCE"
to ".get_budget() fails to get the budget".

Fixes: 88022d7201e9 ("blk-mq: don't handle failure in .get_budget")

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: spi: mxic: The interrupt property is not
 mandatory
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.17.2
Git-commit: 90c204d3195a795f77f5bce767e311dd1c59ca17

commit 90c204d3195a795f77f5bce767e311dd1c59ca17 upstream.

The interrupt property is not mandatory at all, this property should not
be part of the required properties list, so move it into the optional
properties list.

Fixes: 326e5c8d4a87 ("dt-binding: spi: Document Macronix controller bindings")

Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: skip implicit tests if not supported
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.36
Git-commit: 36c4127ae8dd0ebac6d56d8a1b272dd483471c40

commit 36c4127ae8dd0ebac6d56d8a1b272dd483471c40 upstream.

Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
supporting all MPTCP features.

One of them is the support of the implicit endpoints introduced by
commit d045b9eb95a9 ("mptcp: introduce implicit endpoints").

It is possible to look for "mptcp_subflow_send_ack" in kallsyms because
it was needed to introduce the mentioned feature. So we can know in
advance if the feature is supported instead of trying and accepting any
results.

Note that here and in the following commits, we re-do the same check for
each sub-test of the same function for a few reasons. The main one is
not to break the ID assign to each test in order to be able to easily
compare results between different kernel versions. Also, we can still
run a specific test even if it is skipped. Another reason is that it
makes it clear during the review that a specific subtest will be skipped
or not under certain conditions. At the end, it looks OK to call the
exact same helper multiple times: it is not a critical path and it is
the same code that is executed, not really more cases to maintain.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 9447/1: arm/memremap: fix arch_memremap_can_ram_remap()
References: bsc#1234429
Patch-mainline: 6.12.35
Git-commit: 96e0b355883006554a0bee3697da475971d6bba8

commit 96e0b355883006554a0bee3697da475971d6bba8 upstream.

arm/memremap: fix arch_memremap_can_ram_remap()

commit 260364d112bc ("arm[64]/memremap: don't abuse pfn_valid() to ensure
presence of linear map") added the definition of
arch_memremap_can_ram_remap() for arm[64] specific filtering of what pages
can be used from the linear mapping. memblock_is_map_memory() was called
with the pfn of the address given to arch_memremap_can_ram_remap();
however, memblock_is_map_memory() expects to be given an address for arm,
not a pfn.

This results in calls to memremap() returning a newly mapped area when
it should return an address in the existing linear mapping.

Fix this by removing the address to pfn translation and pass the
address directly.

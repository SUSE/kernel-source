Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Fix out-of-srctree build
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.2.3
Git-commit: 0b0757244754ea1d0721195c824770f5576e119e

[ Upstream commit 0b0757244754ea1d0721195c824770f5576e119e ]

Building BPF selftests out of srctree fails with:

  make: *** No rule to make target '/linux-build//ima_setup.sh', needed by 'ima_setup.sh'.  Stop.

The culprit is the rule that defines convenient shorthands like
"make test_progs", which builds $(OUTPUT)/test_progs. These shorthands
make sense only for binaries that are built though; scripts that live
in the source tree do not end up in $(OUTPUT).

Therefore drop $(TEST_PROGS) and $(TEST_PROGS_EXTENDED) from the rule.

The issue exists for a while, but it became a problem only after commit
d68ae4982cb7 ("selftests/bpf: Install all required files to run selftests"),
which added dependencies on these scripts.

Fixes: 03dcb78460c2 ("selftests/bpf: Add simple per-test targets to Makefile")

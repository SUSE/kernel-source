Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/64s: Fix unnecessary copy to 0 when kernel is booted
 at address 0
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.9.9
Git-commit: 13fc6c175924eaa953cf597ce28ffa4edc4554a6

commit 13fc6c175924eaa953cf597ce28ffa4edc4554a6 upstream.

According to the code logic, when the kernel is loaded at address 0, no
copying operation should be performed, but it is currently being done.

This patch fixes the issue where the kernel code was incorrectly
duplicated to address 0 when booting from address 0.

Fixes: b270bebd34e3 ("powerpc/64s: Run at the kernel virtual address earlier in boot")

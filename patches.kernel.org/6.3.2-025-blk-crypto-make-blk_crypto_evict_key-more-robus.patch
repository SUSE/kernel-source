Subject: [PATCH] blk-crypto: make blk_crypto_evict_key() more robust
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.3.2
Git-commit: 5c7cb94452901a93e90c2230632e2c12a681bc92

commit 5c7cb94452901a93e90c2230632e2c12a681bc92 upstream.

If blk_crypto_evict_key() sees that the key is still in-use (due to a
bug) or that ->keyslot_evict failed, it currently just returns while
leaving the key linked into the keyslot management structures.

However, blk_crypto_evict_key() is only called in contexts such as inode
eviction where failure is not an option.  So actually the caller
proceeds with freeing the blk_crypto_key regardless of the return value
of blk_crypto_evict_key().

These two assumptions don't match, and the result is that there can be a
use-after-free in blk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys() after one of these
errors occurs.  (Note, these errors *shouldn't* happen; we're just
talking about what happens if they do anyway.)

Fix this by making blk_crypto_evict_key() unlink the key from the
keyslot management structures even on failure.

Also improve some comments.

Subject: [PATCH] smp,csd: Throw an error if a CSD lock is stuck for too long
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.6.3
Git-commit: 94b3f0b5af2c7af69e3d6e0cdd9b0ea535f22186

[ Upstream commit 94b3f0b5af2c7af69e3d6e0cdd9b0ea535f22186 ]

The CSD lock seems to get stuck in 2 "modes". When it gets stuck
temporarily, it usually gets released in a few seconds, and sometimes
up to one or two minutes.

If the CSD lock stays stuck for more than several minutes, it never
seems to get unstuck, and gradually more and more things in the system
end up also getting stuck.

In the latter case, we should just give up, so the system can dump out
a little more information about what went wrong, and, with panic_on_oops
and a kdump kernel loaded, dump a whole bunch more information about what
might have gone wrong.  In addition, there is an smp.panic_on_ipistall
kernel boot parameter that by default retains the old behavior, but when
set enables the panic after the CSD lock has been stuck for more than
the specified number of milliseconds, as in 300,000 for five minutes.

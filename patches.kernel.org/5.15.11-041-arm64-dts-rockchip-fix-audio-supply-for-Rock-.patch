Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix audio-supply for Rock Pi 4
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.15.11
Git-commit: 8240e87f16d17a9592c9d67857a3dcdbcb98f10d

[ Upstream commit 8240e87f16d17a9592c9d67857a3dcdbcb98f10d ]

As stated in the schematics [1] and [2] P5 the APIO5 domain is supplied
by RK808-D Buck4, which in our case vcc1v8_codec - i.e. a 1.8 V regulator.

Currently only white noise comes from the ES8316's output, which - for
whatever reason - came up only after the the correct switch from i2s0_8ch_bus
to i2s0_2ch_bus for i2s0's pinctrl was done.

Fix this by setting the correct regulator for audio-supply.

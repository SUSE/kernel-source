Subject: [PATCH] iomap: improve shared block detection in iomap_unshare_iter
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.11.7
Git-commit: b53fdb215d13f8e9c29541434bf2d14dac8bcbdc

[ Upstream commit b53fdb215d13f8e9c29541434bf2d14dac8bcbdc ]

Currently iomap_unshare_iter relies on the IOMAP_F_SHARED flag to detect
blocks to unshare.  This is reasonable, but IOMAP_F_SHARED is also useful
for the file system to do internal book keeping for out of place writes.
XFS used to that, until it got removed in commit 72a048c1056a
("xfs: only set IOMAP_F_SHARED when providing a srcmap to a write")
because unshare for incorrectly unshare such blocks.

Add an extra safeguard by checking the explicitly provided srcmap instead
of the fallback to the iomap for valid data, as that catches the case
where we'd just copy from the same place we'd write to easily, allowing
to reinstate setting IOMAP_F_SHARED for all XFS writes that go to the
COW fork.

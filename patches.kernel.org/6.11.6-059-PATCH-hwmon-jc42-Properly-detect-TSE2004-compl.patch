Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH} hwmon: (jc42) Properly detect TSE2004-compliant
 devices again
Patch-mainline: 6.11.6
References: bsc#1012628 bsc#1231312
Git-commit: eabb03810194b75417b09cff8a526d26939736ac

[ Upstream commit eabb03810194b75417b09cff8a526d26939736ac ]

Commit b3e992f69c23 ("hwmon: (jc42)  Strengthen detect function")
attempted to make the detect function more robust for
TSE2004-compliant devices by checking capability bits which, according
to the JEDEC 21-C specification, should always be set. Unfortunately,
not all real-world implementations fully adhere to this specification,
so this change caused a regression.

Stop testing bit 7 (EVSD) of the Capabilities register, as it was
found to be 0 on one real-world device.

Also stop testing bits 0 (EVENT) and 2 (RANGE) as vendor datasheets
(Renesas TSE2004GB2B0, ST STTS2004) suggest that they may not always
be set either.

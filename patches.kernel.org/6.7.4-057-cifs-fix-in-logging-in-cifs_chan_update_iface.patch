Subject: [PATCH] cifs: fix in logging in cifs_chan_update_iface
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.7.4
Git-commit: 516eea97f92f1e7271f20835cfe9e73774b0f8cc

[ Upstream commit 516eea97f92f1e7271f20835cfe9e73774b0f8cc ]

Recently, cifs_chan_update_iface was modified to not
remove an iface if a suitable replacement was not found.
With that, there were two conditionals that were exactly
the same. This change removes that extra condition check.

Also, fixed a logging in the same function to indicate
the correct message.

Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Initialise numa_migrate_retry
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 70ce3ea9aa4ed901c8a90de667df5ef307766e71

[ Upstream commit 70ce3ea9aa4ed901c8a90de667df5ef307766e71 ]

On clone, numa_migrate_retry is inherited from the parent which means
that the first NUMA placement of a task is non-deterministic. This
affects when load balancing recognises numa tasks and whether to
migrate "regular", "remote" or "all" tasks between NUMA scheduler
domains.

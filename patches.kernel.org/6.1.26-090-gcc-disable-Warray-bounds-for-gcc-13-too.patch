Subject: [PATCH] gcc: disable '-Warray-bounds' for gcc-13 too
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.26
Git-commit: 0da6e5fd6c3726723e275603426e09178940dace

commit 0da6e5fd6c3726723e275603426e09178940dace upstream.

We started disabling '-Warray-bounds' for gcc-12 originally on s390,
because it resulted in some warnings that weren't realistically fixable
(commit 8b202ee21839: "s390: disable -Warray-bounds").

That s390-specific issue was then found to be less common elsewhere, but
generic (see f0be87c42cbd: "gcc-12: disable '-Warray-bounds' universally
for now"), and then later expanded the version check was expanded to
gcc-11 (5a41237ad1d4: "gcc: disable -Warray-bounds for gcc-11 too").

And it turns out that I was much too optimistic in thinking that it's
all going to go away, and here we are with gcc-13 showing all the same
issues.  So instead of expanding this one version at a time, let's just
disable it for gcc-11+, and put an end limit to it only when we actually
find a solution.

Yes, I'm sure some of this is because the kernel just does odd things
(like our "container_of()" use, but also knowingly playing games with
things like linker tables and array layouts).

And yes, some of the warnings are likely signs of real bugs, but when
there are hundreds of false positives, that doesn't really help.

Oh well.

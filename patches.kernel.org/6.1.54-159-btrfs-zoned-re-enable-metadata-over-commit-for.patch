Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: zoned: re-enable metadata over-commit for zoned mode
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.54
Git-commit: 5b135b382a360f4c87cf8896d1465b0b07f10cb0

commit 5b135b382a360f4c87cf8896d1465b0b07f10cb0 upstream.

Now that, we can re-enable metadata over-commit. As we moved the activation
from the reservation time to the write time, we no longer need to ensure
all the reserved bytes is properly activated.

Without the metadata over-commit, it suffers from lower performance because
it needs to flush the delalloc items more often and allocate more block
groups. Re-enabling metadata over-commit will solve the issue.

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: Fix best extent lstart adjustment logic in
 ext4_mb_new_inode_pa()
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.30
Git-commit: 93cdf49f6eca5e23f6546b8f28457b2e6a6961d9

[ Upstream commit 93cdf49f6eca5e23f6546b8f28457b2e6a6961d9 ]

When the length of best extent found is less than the length of goal extent
we need to make sure that the best extent atleast covers the start of the
original request. This is done by adjusting the ac_b_ex.fe_logical (logical
start) of the extent.

While doing so, the current logic sometimes results in the best extent's
logical range overflowing the goal extent. Since this best extent is later
added to the inode preallocation list, we have a possibility of introducing
overlapping preallocations. This is discussed in detail here [1].

As per Jan's suggestion, to fix this, replace the existing logic with the
below logic for adjusting best extent as it keeps fragmentation in check
while ensuring logical range of best extent doesn't overflow out of goal
extent:

1. Check if best extent can be kept at end of goal range and still cover
   original start.
2. Else, check if best extent can be kept at start of goal range and still
   cover original start.
3. Else, keep the best extent at start of original request.

Also, add a few extra BUG_ONs that might help catch errors faster.

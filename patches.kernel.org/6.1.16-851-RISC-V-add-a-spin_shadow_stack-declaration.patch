Subject: [PATCH] RISC-V: add a spin_shadow_stack declaration
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.16
Git-commit: eb9be8310c58c166f9fae3b71c0ad9d6741b4897

commit eb9be8310c58c166f9fae3b71c0ad9d6741b4897 upstream.

The patchwork automation reported a sparse complaint that
spin_shadow_stack was not declared and should be static:
../arch/riscv/kernel/traps.c:335:15: warning: symbol 'spin_shadow_stack' was not declared. Should it be static?

However, this is used in entry.S and therefore shouldn't be static.
The same applies to the shadow_stack that this pseudo spinlock is
trying to protect, so do like its charge and add a declaration to
thread_info.h

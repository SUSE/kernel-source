Subject: [PATCH] kselftest/arm64: signal: Skip tests if required features are
 missing
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.14.9
Git-commit: 0e3dbf765fe22060acbcb8eb8c4d256e655a1247

[ Upstream commit 0e3dbf765fe22060acbcb8eb8c4d256e655a1247 ]

During initialization of a signal testcase, features declared as required
are properly checked against the running system but no action is then taken
to effectively skip such a testcase.

Fix core signals test logic to abort initialization and report such a
testcase as skipped to the KSelfTest framework.

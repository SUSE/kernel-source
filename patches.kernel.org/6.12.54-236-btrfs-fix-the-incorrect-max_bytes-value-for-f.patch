[ Upstream commit 7b26da407420e5054e3f06c5d13271697add9423 ]

[BUG]
With my local branch to enable bs > ps support for btrfs, sometimes I
hit the following ASSERT() inside submit_one_sector():

	ASSERT(block_start != EXTENT_MAP_HOLE);

Please note that it's not yet possible to hit this ASSERT() in the wild
yet, as it requires btrfs bs > ps support, which is not even in the
development branch.

But on the other hand, there is also a very low chance to hit above
ASSERT() with bs < ps cases, so this is an existing bug affect not only
the incoming bs > ps support but also the existing bs < ps support.

[CAUSE]
Firstly that ASSERT() means we're trying to submit a dirty block but
without a real extent map nor ordered extent map backing it.

Furthermore with extra debugging, the folio triggering such ASSERT() is
always larger than the fs block size in my bs > ps case.
(8K block size, 4K page size)

After some more debugging, the ASSERT() is trigger by the following
sequence:

 extent_writepage()
 |  We got a 32K folio (4 fs blocks) at file offset 0, and the fs block
 |  size is 8K, page size is 4K.
 |  And there is another 8K folio at file offset 32K, which is also
 |  dirty.
 |  So the filemap layout looks like the following:
 |
 |  "||" is the filio boundary in the filemap.
 |  "//| is the dirty range.
 |
 |  0        8K       16K        24K         32K       40K
 |  |////////|        |//////////////////////||////////|
 |
 |- writepage_delalloc()
 |  |- find_lock_delalloc_range() for [0, 8K)
 |  |  Now range [0, 8K) is properly locked.
 |  |
 |  |- find_lock_delalloc_range() for [16K, 40K)
 |  |  |- btrfs_find_delalloc_range() returned range [16K, 40K)
 |  |  |- lock_delalloc_folios() locked folio 0 successfully
 |  |  |
 |  |  |  The filemap range [32K, 40K) got dropped from filemap.
 |  |  |
 |  |  |- lock_delalloc_folios() failed with -EAGAIN on folio 32K
 |  |  |  As the folio at 32K is dropped.
 |  |  |
 |  |  |- loops = 1;
 |  |  |- max_bytes = PAGE_SIZE;
 |  |  |- goto again;
 |  |  |  This will re-do the lookup for dirty delalloc ranges.
 |  |  |
 |  |  |- btrfs_find_delalloc_range() called with @max_bytes == 4K
 |  |  |  This is smaller than block size, so
 |  |  |  btrfs_find_delalloc_range() is unable to return any range.
 |  |  \- return false;
 |  |
 |  \- Now only range [0, 8K) has an OE for it, but for dirty range
 |     [16K, 32K) it's dirty without an OE.
 |     This breaks the assumption that writepage_delalloc() will find
 |     and lock all dirty ranges inside the folio.
 |
 |- extent_writepage_io()
    |- submit_one_sector() for [0, 8K)
    |  Succeeded
    |
    |- submit_one_sector() for [16K, 24K)
       Triggering the ASSERT(), as there is no OE, and the original
       extent map is a hole.

Please note that, this also exposed the same problem for bs < ps
support. E.g. with 64K page size and 4K block size.

If we failed to lock a folio, and falls back into the "loops = 1;"
branch, we will re-do the search using 64K as max_bytes.
Which may fail again to lock the next folio, and exit early without
handling all dirty blocks inside the folio.

[FIX]
Instead of using the fixed size PAGE_SIZE as @max_bytes, use
@sectorsize, so that we are ensured to find and lock any remaining
blocks inside the folio.

And since we're here, add an extra ASSERT() to
before calling btrfs_find_delalloc_range() to make sure the @max_bytes is
at least no smaller than a block to avoid false negative.

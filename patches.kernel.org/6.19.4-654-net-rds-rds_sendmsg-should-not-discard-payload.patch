Subject: [PATCH] net/rds: rds_sendmsg should not discard payload_len
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.19.4
Git-commit: da29e453dcb3aa7cabead7915f5f945d0add3a52

[ Upstream commit da29e453dcb3aa7cabead7915f5f945d0add3a52 ]

Commit 3db6e0d172c9 ("rds: use RCU to synchronize work-enqueue with
connection teardown") modifies rds_sendmsg to avoid enqueueing work
while a tear down is in progress. However, it also changed the return
value of rds_sendmsg to that of rds_send_xmit instead of the
payload_len. This means the user may incorrectly receive errno values
when it should have simply received a payload of 0 while the peer
attempts a reconnections.  So this patch corrects the teardown handling
code to only use the out error path in that case, thus restoring the
original payload_len return value.

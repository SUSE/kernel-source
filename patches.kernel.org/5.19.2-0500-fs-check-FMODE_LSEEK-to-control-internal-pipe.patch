Subject: [PATCH] fs: check FMODE_LSEEK to control internal pipe splicing
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.19.2
Git-commit: 97ef77c52b789ec1411d360ed99dca1efe4b2c81

[ Upstream commit 97ef77c52b789ec1411d360ed99dca1efe4b2c81 ]

The original direct splicing mechanism from Jens required the input to
be a regular file because it was avoiding the special socket case. It
also recognized blkdevs as being close enough to a regular file. But it
forgot about chardevs, which behave the same way and work fine here.

This is an okayish heuristic, but it doesn't totally work. For example,
a few chardevs should be spliceable here. And a few regular files
shouldn't. This patch fixes this by instead checking whether FMODE_LSEEK
is set, which represents decently enough what we need rewinding for when
splicing to internal pipes.

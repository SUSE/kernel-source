Subject: [PATCH] cfi: Fix CFI failure with KASAN
References: bsc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 6.1.2
Git-commit: cf8016408d880afe9c5dc495af40dc2932874e77

[ Upstream commit cf8016408d880afe9c5dc495af40dc2932874e77 ]

When CFI_CLANG and KASAN are both enabled, LLVM doesn't generate a
CFI type hash for asan.module_ctor functions in translation units
where CFI is disabled, which leads to a CFI failure during boot when
do_ctors calls the affected constructors:

  CFI failure at do_basic_setup+0x64/0x90 (target:
  asan.module_ctor+0x0/0x28; expected type: 0xa540670c)

Specifically, this happens because CFI is disabled for
kernel/cfi.c. There's no reason to keep CFI disabled here anymore, so
fix the failure by not filtering out CC_FLAGS_CFI for the file.

Note that https://reviews.llvm.org/rG3b14862f0a96 fixed the issue
where LLVM didn't emit CFI type hashes for any sanitizer constructors,
but now type hashes are emitted correctly for TUs that use CFI.
